uncertified death. In developing countries, if a death occurs away from health
facilities, a field-worker interviews a relative of the deceased about the
circumstances of the death; this Verbal Autopsy can be reviewed off-site. We
report on a comparative study of the processes involved in Text Classification
applied to classifying Cause of Death: feature value representation; machine
learning classification algorithms; and feature reduction strategies in order
to identify the suitable approaches applicable to the classification of Verbal
Autopsy text. We demonstrate that normalised term frequency and the standard
TFiDF achieve comparable performance across a number of classifiers. The
results also show Support Vector Machine is superior to other classification
algorithms employed in this research. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of employing a ""locally-semi-supervised"" feature reduction strategy in order to
increase performance accuracy.

with linear constraints has drawn more attention recently in imaging
applications due to its decomposable structure for composite cost functions and
empirical fast convergence rate under weak conditions. However, for problems
such as X-ray computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction and large-scale
sparse regression with ""big data"", where there is no efficient way to solve the
inner least-squares problem, the AL method can be slow due to the inevitable
iterative inner updates. In this paper, we focus on solving regularized
(weighted) least-squares problems using a linearized variant of the AL method
that replaces the quadratic AL penalty term in the scaled augmented Lagrangian
with its separable quadratic surrogate (SQS) function, thus leading to a much
simpler ordered-subsets (OS) accelerable splitting-based algorithm, OS-LALM,
for X-ray CT image reconstruction. To further accelerate the proposed
algorithm, we use a second-order recursive system analysis to design a
deterministic downward continuation approach that avoids tedious parameter
tuning and provides fast convergence. Experimental results show that the
proposed algorithm significantly accelerates the ""convergence"" of X-ray CT
image reconstruction with negligible overhead and greatly reduces the OS
artifacts in the reconstructed image when using many subsets for OS
acceleration.

the scale of the smallest modules that can be resolved depends on the size of
the analyzed subnetwork. The resolution limit is known to prevent some
community detection algorithms from accurately identifying the modular
structure of a network. In fact, any global objective function for measuring
the quality of a two-level assignment of nodes into modules must have some sort
of resolution limit or an external resolution parameter. However, it is yet
unknown how the resolution limit affects the so-called map equation, which is
known to be an efficient objective function for community detection. We derive
an analytical estimate and conclude that the resolution limit of the map
equation is set by the total number of links between modules instead of the
total number of links in the full network as for modularity. This mechanism
makes the resolution limit much less restrictive for the map equation than for
modularity, and in practice orders of magnitudes smaller. Furthermore, we argue
that the effect of the resolution limit often results from shoehorning
multi-level modular structures into two-level descriptions. As we show, the
hierarchical map equation effectively eliminates the resolution limit for
networks with nested multi-level modular structures.

novel and intelligent if the task of font size detection could be carried out

detecting font size directly from run-length compressed text documents at line

OCRing and document analysis directly from compressed documents. In the
proposed model, the given mixed-case text documents of different font size are
segmented into compressed text lines and the features extracted such as line
height and ascender height are used to capture the pattern of font size in the
form of a regression line, using which the automatic detection of font size is
done during the recognition stage. The method is experimented with a dataset of
50 compressed documents consisting of 780 text lines of single font size and
375 text lines of mixed font size resulting in an overall accuracy of 99.67%.

Penning-trap mass spectrometry (PT-MS) in investigating atomic orbital electron
capture (EC) can shed light on the possible existence of heavy sterile
neutrinos with masses from 0.5 to 100 keV. Sterile neutrinos are expected to
perturb the shape of the atomic de-excitation spectrum measured by CM after a
capture of the atomic orbital electrons by a nucleus. This effect should be
observable in the ratios of the capture probabilities from different orbits.
The sensitivity of the ratio values to the contribution of sterile neutrinos
strongly depends on how accurately the mass difference between the parent and
the daughter nuclides of EC-transitions can be measured by, e.g., PT-MS. A
comparison of such probability ratios in different isotopes of a certain
chemical element allows one to exclude many systematic uncertainties and thus
could make feasible a determination of the contribution of sterile neutrinos on

Slavnov-Taylor (ST) identity holds to all orders in perturbation theory and
strongly constrains the CGC effective field theory (EFT) arising from the
integration of the soft modes. We show that the ST identity guarantees
gauge-invariance of the EFT. It also allows to control the dependence on the
gauge-fixing choice for the semifast modes (usually the lightcone gauge in
explicit computations). The formal properties of the evolution equations valid
in different regimes (BKFL, JIMWLK, ...) can be all derived in a unified
setting within this algebraic approach.

the state transitions. In the simplest case, the state spaces are discrete, and
the structure map simply takes each state to the next states. But the
coalgebraic view is also quite effective for studying processes over structured
state spaces, e.g. measurable, or continuous. In the present paper we consider
coalgebras over manifolds. This means that the captured processes evolve over
state spaces that are not just continuous, but also locally homeomorphic to
Banach spaces, and thus carry a differential structure. Both dynamical systems
and differential forms arise as coalgebras over such state spaces, for two
different endofunctors over manifolds. A duality induced by these two
endofunctors provides a formal underpinning for the informal geometric
intuitions linking differential forms and dynamical systems in the various
practical applications, e.g. in physics. This joint functorial reconstruction
of tangent bundles and cotangent bundles uncovers the universal properties and
a high level view of these fundamental structures, which are implemented rather
intricately in their standard form. The succinct coalgebraic presentation
provides unexpected insights even about the situations as familiar as Newton's
laws.

parametrize Knightian uncertainty. This creates a two-step optimization problem

an entity, and resolving entities based on these attributes is a well-studied

others; e.g., a person may provide his driving-licence number while applying

stationary point guarantees for non-convex problems, and for convex ones, we

our scheme to composite optimization and obtain a new incremental proximal

machine are calculated such that the sum of the square of differences between
full load torques, starting torques, maximum torques, starting currents, full
load currents, and nominal power factors obtained from model and provided by
manufacturer is minimized. In order to confirm the efficiency of the proposed
method the results are also compared with those achieved by using GA, PSO, and
PAMP. The simulations show that in the problem under consideration ABC
converges considerably faster than other algorithms and the results are as
accurate as PAMP.

transitions. We identify a broad class of random lattices whose disorder
fluctuations decay much faster with increasing length scale than those of
generic random systems, yielding a wandering exponent of $\omega=(d-1)/(2d)$ in
$d$ dimensions. %instead of the generic value $\omega=1/2$. The stability of
clean critical points is thus governed by the criterion $(d+1)\nu > 2$ rather
than the usual Harris criterion $d\nu>2$, making topological disorder less
relevant than generic randomness. The Imry-Ma criterion is also modified,
allowing first-order transitions to survive in all dimensions $d>1$. These
results explain a host of puzzling violations of the original criteria for
equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase transitions on random lattices. We discuss
applications, and we illustrate our theory by computer simulations of random
Voronoi and other lattices.

large fluctuations. These fluctuations may manifest differently according to
the given model. In this paper we re-consider hidden variable models which turn
out to be more analytically treatable and for which we have recently shown
clear evidence of non-self averaging; the density of a motif being subject to
possible uncontrollable fluctuations in the infinite size limit. Here we
provide full detailed calculations and we show that large fluctuations are only
due to the node hidden variables variability while, in ensembles where these
are frozen, fluctuations are negligible in the thermodynamic limit, and equal
the fluctuations of classical random graphs. A special attention is paid to the
choice of the cut-off: we show that in hidden-variable models, only a cut-off
growing as $N^\lambda$ with $\lambda\geq 1$ can reproduce the scaling of a
power-law degree distribution. In turn, it is this large cut-off that generates
non-self-averaging.

accurate optical positions. Contemporary to these deep CCD images the same

same bandpass. They provide accurate positions on the Hipparcos/Tycho-2 system
for stars in the 10 to 16 magnitude range used as reference stars for the deep
CCD imaging data. Here we present final optical position results of 413 sources
based on reference stars obtained by dedicated astrograph observations which
were reduced following 2 different procedures. These optical positions are
compared to radio VLBI positions. The current optical system is not perfectly
aligned to the ICRF radio system with rigid body rotation angles of 3 to 5 mas
(= 3 sigma level) found between them for all 3 axes. Furthermore,
statistically, the optical minus radio position differences are found to exceed
the total, combined, known errors in the observations. Systematic errors in the
optical reference star positions as well as physical offsets between the
centers of optical and radio emissions are both identified as likely causes. A
detrimental, astrophysical, random noise (DARN) component is postulated to be
on about the 10 mas level. If confirmed by future observations, this could
severely limit the Gaia to ICRF reference frame alignment accuracy to an error
of about 0.5 mas per coordinate axis with the current number of sources
envisioned to provide the link. A list of 36 ICRF sources without the detection

However, the recently identified Green Pea (GP) galaxies are similar to
high-redshift galaxies in their morphologies and star formation rates and are
vital tools for probing the generation and transmission of ionizing photons.
The GPs contain massive star clusters that emit copious amounts of high-energy
radiation, as indicated by intense [OIII] 5007 emission and HeII 4686 emission.
We focus on six GP galaxies with high ratios of [O III] 5007,4959/[O II] 3727
~10 or more. Such high ratios indicate gas with a high ionization parameter or
a low optical depth. The GP line ratios and ages point to chemically
homogeneous massive stars, Wolf-Rayet stars, or shock ionization as the most
likely sources of the He II emission. Models including shock ionization suggest
that the GPs may have low optical depths, consistent with a scenario in which
ionizing photons escape along passageways created by recent supernovae. The GPs
and similar galaxies can shed new light on cosmic reionization by revealing how
ionizing photons propagate from massive star clusters to the intergalactic
medium.

apply to a heavy vector triplet of the Standard Model (SM) group for
illustration. The method is based on a simplified phenomenological Lagrangian
which reproduces a large class of explicit models. Firstly, this allows us to
derive robust model-independent phenomenological features and, conversely, to
identify the peculiarities of different explicit realizations. Secondly, limits
on cross-section times BR can be converted into bounds on a few relevant
parameters in a fully analytic way, allowing for an interpretation in any given
explicit model. Based on the available 8 TeV LHC analyses, we derive current
limits and interpret them for vector triplets arising in weakly coupled (gauge)
and strongly coupled (composite) extensions of the SM. We point out that a
model-independent limit setting procedure must be based on purely on-shell
quantities, like a cross-section times BR. Finite width effects altering the
limits can be considerably reduced by focusing on the on-shell signal region.
We illustrate this aspect with a study of the invariant mass distribution in
di-lepton searches and the transverse mass distribution in lepton-neutrino
final states. In addition to this paper we provide a set of online tools
available at a dedicated webpage.

the intraorbital attractive interaction is stronger than the interorbital

an elongated diffuse radio source and surrounded by other features of lower

1.4 GHz image obtained through a re-analysis of archival NVSS data.
Interestingly, the elongated radio source coincides with a previously
unclassified extended X-ray source. We perform a multi-wavelength analysis
based on archival infrared, optical and X-ray Chandra data. We find that this
source is a low-temperature (~3.6 keV) cluster of galaxies, with indications of
a disturbed dynamical state, located at a redshift that is consistent with the
one of the main galaxy cluster MACS J0520.7-132 (z=0.336). We suggest that the
diffuse radio emission is associated with the non-thermal components in the
intracluster and intergalactic medium in and around the newly detected cluster.

address more precisely the nature of the complex radio emission.

applied to different software engineering problems where many conflicting

natural selection, these evolutionary algorithms produce many deadborn
solutions whose computation results in a computational resources wastage:
natural selection is naturally slow. In this paper, we reconsider this founding
analogy to accelerate convergence of MOEA, by looking at modern biology
studies: artificial selection has been used to achieve an anticipated specific
purpose instead of only relying on crossover and natural selection (i.e.,
Muller et al [18] research on artificial mutation of fruits with X-Ray).
Putting aside the analogy with natural selection , the present paper proposes
an hyper-heuristic for MOEA algorithms named Sputnik 1 that uses artificial
selective mutation to improve the convergence speed of MOEA. Sputnik leverages
the past history of mutation efficiency to select the most relevant mutations
to perform. We evaluate Sputnik on a cloud-reasoning engine, which drives
on-demand provisioning while considering conflicting performance and cost
objectives. We have conducted experiments to highlight the significant
performance improvement of Sputnik in terms of resolution time.

polarization effects originate fundamentally from specific atomic site

overlooked hidden form of spin polarization should exist in centrosymmetric
materials. Although all energy bands must be doubly degenerate in
centrosymmetric materials, we find that the two components of such doubly
degenerate bands could have opposite polarizations each spatially localized on
one of the two separate sectors forming the inversion partners. We demonstrate
such hidden spin polarizations in centrosymmetric crystals (denoted as R-2 and
D-2) by first-principles calculations. This new understanding could
considerably broaden the range of currently useful spintronic materials and
enable control of spin polarization via operations on atomic scale.

critical point (LLCP) in models of silica at high pressure. To clarify this
interesting question we run extended molecular dynamics simulations of two
different silica models (WAC and BKS) and perform a detailed analysis of the
liquid at temperatures much lower than those previously simulated. We find no
LLCP in either model within the accessible temperature range, although it is
closely approached in the case of the WAC potential near 4000 K and 5 GPa.
Comparing our results with those obtained for other tetrahedral liquids, and
relating the average Si-O-Si bond angle and liquid density at the model glass
temperature to those of the ice-like beta-cristobalite structure, we conclude
that the absence of a critical point can be attributed to insufficient
""stiffness"" in the bond angle. We hypothesize that a modification of the
potential function to mildly favor larger average bond angles will generate a
LLCP in a temperature range that is accessible to simulation. The tendency to
crystallize in these models is extremely weak in the pressure range studied,
although this tendency will undoubtedly increase with increasing stiffness.

shape, and albedo of the large Kuiper belt object Haumea. The correlation
between the visible and thermal photometry demonstrates that Haumea's high
amplitude and quickly varying optical light curve is indeed due to Haumea's
extreme shape, rather than large scale albedo variations. However, the
well-sampled high precision visible data we present does require longitudinal
surface heterogeneity to account for the shape of lightcurve. The thermal
emission from Haumea is consistent with the expected Jacobi ellipsoid shape of
a rapidly rotating body in hydrostatic equilibrium. The best Jacobi ellipsoid
fit to the visible photometry implies a triaxial ellipsoid with axes of length
1920 x 1540 x 990 km and density 2.6 g cm^-3$, as found by Lellouch et
al(2010). While the thermal and visible data cannot uniquely constrain the full
non-spherical shape of Haumea, the match between the predicted and measured
thermal flux for a dense Jacobi ellipsoid suggests that Haumea is indeed one of
the densest objects in the Kuiper belt.

this, we propose a permutation test called Significance test of Joint Effect

equivalent to many marginal methods. However, when joint effects exist, our
method can significantly boost the performance of variable selection. Such
joint effects can help to provide additional, and sometimes dominating,

both simulated example and a real glioblastoma multiforme data set, which

mass. We find that gas expulsion and the associated dark matter (DM) expansion
induced by supernova-driven winds are important for haloes with masses M200 <
10^13 Msun, lowering their masses by up to 20% relative to a DM-only model. AGN
feedback, which is required to prevent overcooling, has a significant impact on
halo masses all the way up to cluster scales (M200 ~ 10^15 Msun). Baryonic
physics changes the total mass profiles of haloes out to several times the
virial radius, a modification that cannot be captured by a change in the halo
concentration. The decrease in the total halo mass causes a decrease in the
halo mass function of about 20%. This effect can have important consequences
for abundance matching technique as well as for most semi-analytic models of
galaxy formation. We provide analytic fitting formulae, derived from
simulations that reproduce the observed baryon fractions, to correct halo
masses and mass functions from DM-only simulations. The effect of baryonic
physics (AGN feedback in particular) on cluster number counts is about as large
as changing the cosmology from WMAP7 to Planck, even when a moderately high
mass limit of M500 ~ 10^14 Msun is adopted. Thus, for precision cosmology the

However, ambiguities exist because these phenomena could also come from bulk

field-effect transistors in (Bi0.04Sb0.96)2Te3 thin films grown by molecular

(increasing its slope by up to 10 times). The SS-enhanced LMR is accompanied by
a strongly nonlinear Hall effect, suggesting important roles of charge
inhomogeneity (and a related classical LMR), although existing models of LMR

compare our Chandra sample of galactic coronae of 53 nearby highly-inclined
disc galaxies to an analytical model considering only the accretion of IGM. We
confirm the existing conclusion that this pure accretion model substantially
over-predicts the coronal emission. We then select 30 field galaxies from our
original sample, and correct their coronal luminosities to uniformly compare
them to deep X-ray measurements of several massive disc galaxies from the
literature, as well as to a comparable sample of simulated galaxies drawn from
the Galaxies-Intergalactic Medium Interaction Calculation (GIMIC). These
simulations explicitly model both accretion and SNe feedback and yield galaxies
exhibit X-ray properties in broad agreement with our observational sample.
However, notable and potentially instructive discrepancies exist between the
slope and scatter of the Lx-M200 and Lx-SFR relations, highlighting some known
shortcomings of GIMIC, e.g., the absence of AGN feedback, and possibly the
adoption of constant stellar feedback parameters. The simulated galaxies
exhibit a tight Lx-M200 correlation with little scatter. Having inferred M200
for our observational sample via the Tully-Fisher relation, we find a weaker
and more scattered correlation. In the simulated and observed samples alike,
massive non-starburst galaxies above a typical transition mass of M*~2e11Msun
or M200~1e13Msun tend to have higher Lx/M* and Lx/M200 than low-mass

explodes as a supernova, a fast, $>30,000$ km/s, shock is expected to be driven
through a wind. We study the signal expected from a fast supernova shock
propagating through an optically thick wind, and find that the electrons behind
the shock driven into the wind are cooled efficiently, by inverse Compton over
soft photons that were deposited by the radiation mediated shock that crossed
the star. Therefore, the bolometric luminosity is comparable to the kinetic
energy flux through the shock, and the spectrum is found to be a power-law,
which slope and frequency range depend on the number flux of soft photons
available for cooling. Wolf-Rayet supernovae that explode through a thick wind
have a high flux of soft photons, producing a flat spectrum, $\nu
F_{\nu}=Const$, in the X-ray range $0.1\lesssim T\lesssim 50$ keV. As the shock
expands into an optically thin wind, the soft photons are no longer able to
cool the shock that plows through the wind, and the bulk of the emission takes
the form of a standard core-collapse supernova (without a wind). However, a
small fraction of the soft photons is upscattered by the shocked wind and
produces a transient unique X-ray signature.

  Methods: We compared the results of test particle simulations of the Milky

RAVE survey. To this end we applied the RAVE selection function to the
simulations and convolved these with the characteristic RAVE errors. We
explored different ""solar neighborhoods"" in the simulations, as well as
different bar models
  Results: We find that the bar induces a negative radial velocity gradient at
every height from the Galactic plane, outside the outer Lindblad resonance and
for angles from the long axis of the bar compatible with the current estimates.
The selection function and errors do not wash away the gradient, but often make
it steeper, especially near the Galactic plane, because this is where the RAVE
survey is less radially extended. No gradient in the vertical velocity
ispresent in our simulations, from which we may conclude that this cannot be
induced by the bar.

observation carried out in November 2011. As the properties of the multiphase
warm absorber (thoroughly discussed in a recent, complementary work) hint at a
steep photoionizing continuum, here we investigate into the nature of the
intrinsic X-ray emission of MR 2251-178 by testing several physical models. The
apparent 2-10 keV flatness as well as the subtle broadband curvature can be
ascribed to partial covering of the X-ray source by a cold, clumpy absorption
system with column densities ranging from a fraction to several x10^23 cm^-2.
As opposed to more complex configurations, only one cloud is required along the
line of sight in the presence of a soft X-ray excess, possibly arising as
Comptonized disc emission in the accretion disc atmosphere. On statistical
grounds, even reflection with standard efficiency off the surface of the inner
disc cannot be ruled out, although this tentatively overpredicts the observed ~
14-150 keV emission. It is thus possible that each of the examined physical
processes is relevant to a certain degree, and hence only a combination of
high-quality, simultaneous broadband spectral coverage and multi-epoch
monitoring of X-ray spectral variability could help disentangling the different
contributions. Yet, regardless of the model adopted, we infer for MR 2251-178 a
bolometric luminosity of ~ 5-7 x 10^45 erg/s, implying that the central black
hole is accreting at ~ 15-25 per cent of the Eddington limit.

timing properties on spectral shape and photon energy, and study correlations
between Fourier-frequency dependent coherence and time lags with features in
the power spectra. Our main results are: (a) The fractional rms in the
0.125-256 Hz range in different spectral states shows complex behavior that
depends on the energy range considered. It reaches its maximum not in the hard
state, but in the soft state in the Comptonized tail above 10 keV. (b) The
shape of power spectra in hard and intermediate states and the normalization in
the soft state are strongly energy dependent in the 2.1-15 keV range. This
emphasizes the need for an energy-dependent treatment of power spectra and a
careful consideration of energy- and mass-scaling when comparing the
variability of different source types, e.g., black hole binaries and AGN. PSDs
during extremely hard and extremely soft states can be easily confused for
energies above ~5 keV in the 0.125-256 Hz range. (c) The coherence between
energy bands drops during transitions from the intermediate into the soft state
but recovers in the soft state. (d) The time lag spectra in soft and
intermediate states show distinct features at frequencies related to the
frequencies of the main variability components seen in the power spectra and
show the same shift to higher frequencies as the source softens. [...abridged]

tau_10~0.67+/-0.04 if the covering factor is taken into account. We also
detected the 18 micron silicate absorption feature in our data with a >3-sigma
significance. Due to the proximity of the 18 micron absorption feature to the
edge of our covered spectral range, and associated uncertainty about the shape
of the quasar continuum normalization near 18 micron, we do not independently
fit this feature. We find, however, that the shape and depth of the 18 micron
silicate absorption are well-matched to the amorphous olivine template
prediction, given the optical depth inferred for the 10 micron feature. The
measured 10 micron peak optical depth in this absorber is significantly higher
than those found in previously studied quasar absorption systems. The
reddening, 21-cm absorption, and velocity spread of Mg II are not outliers

role in many high dimensional machine learning applications. In some cases, the
features can be grouped together so that entire subsets of features can be
selected or not selected. In many applications, however, this can be too
restrictive. In this paper, we are interested in a less restrictive form of
structured sparse feature selection: we assume that while features can be
grouped according to some notion of similarity, not all features in a group
need be selected for the task at hand. When the groups are comprised of
disjoint sets of features, this is sometimes referred to as the ""sparse group""
lasso, and it allows for working with a richer class of models than traditional
group lasso methods. Our framework generalizes conventional sparse group lasso
further by allowing for overlapping groups, an additional flexiblity needed in
many applications and one that presents further challenges. The main
contribution of this paper is a new procedure called Sparse Overlapping Group
(SOG) lasso, a convex optimization program that automatically selects similar
features for classification in high dimensions. We establish model selection
error bounds for SOGlasso classification problems under a fairly general
setting. In particular, the error bounds are the first such results for
classification using the sparse group lasso. Furthermore, the general SOGlasso
bound specializes to results for the lasso and the group lasso, some known and
some new. The SOGlasso is motivated by multi-subject fMRI studies in which
functional activity is classified using brain voxels as features, source
localization problems in Magnetoencephalography (MEG), and analyzing gene
activation patterns in microarray data analysis. Experiments with real and
synthetic data demonstrate the advantages of SOGlasso compared to the lasso and

allows for not only the standard square tiles, but also ""duple"" tiles which are
rectangles pre-formed by the joining of two square tiles. We show that the
addition of duples allows for powerful behaviors of self-assembling systems at
temperature 1, meaning systems which exclude the requirement of cooperative
binding by tiles (i.e., the requirement that a tile must be able to bind to at
least 2 tiles in an existing assembly if it is to attach). Cooperative binding
is conjectured to be required in the standard aTAM for Turing universal
computation and the efficient self-assembly of shapes, but we show that in the
DaTAM these behaviors can in fact be exhibited at temperature 1. We then show
that the DaTAM doesn't provide asymptotic improvements over the aTAM in its
ability to efficiently build thin rectangles. Finally, we present a series of
results which prove that the temperature-2 aTAM and temperature-1 DaTAM have
mutually exclusive powers. That is, each is able to self-assemble shapes that
the other can't, and each has systems which cannot be simulated by the other.

system size. We compare the proposed method to the Spinach package that uses
heuristic restricted state space techniques to achieve polynomial complexity
scaling. When the spin system topology is close to a linear chain (e.g. for the
backbone of a protein), the tensor train representation is more compact and can
be computed faster than the sparse representation using restricted state

Although never measured and possibly unphysical, certain realizations of
quantum field theories leaves the door open for such a possibility. In this
paper we analyze the evolution of a universe comprising varying amounts of
negative energy forms. Negative energy components have negative normalized
energy densities, $\Omega < 0$. They include negative phantom energy with an
equation of state parameter $w<-1$, negative cosmological constant: $w=-1$,
negative domain walls: $w=-2/3$, negative cosmic strings: $w=-1/3$, negative
mass: $w=0$, negative radiation: $w=1/3$ and negative ultralight: $w > 1/3$.
Assuming that such energy forms generate pressure like perfect fluids, the
attractive or repulsive nature of negative energy components are reviewed. The
Friedmann equation is satisfied only when negative energy forms are coupled to
a greater magnitude of positive energy forms or positive curvature. We show
that the solutions exhibit cyclic evolution with bounces and turnovers.The

phenomena can only be addressed if we go beyond the scheme one pathogen-one

analytically the epidemic thresholds of the two diseases for different

the onset of a disease's outbreak is conditioned to the prevalence levels of
the other disease. Moreover, we show, for the SIS scheme, that under certain
circumstances, finite and not vanishing epidemic thresholds are found even at
the thermodynamic limit for scale-free networks. For the SIR scenario, the
phenomenology is richer and additional interdependencies show up. We also find
that the secondary thresholds for the SIS and SIR models are different, which
results directly from the interaction between both diseases. Our work thus
solve an important problem and pave the way towards a more comprehensive

show that, in the stellar mass range covered by the HRS (8<log(M*/Msun)<12),
the far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours are inconsistent with a single modified
black-body having the same dust emissivity index beta for all galaxies. In
particular, either beta decreases, or multiple temperature components are
needed, when moving from metal-rich/gas-poor to metal-poor/gas-rich galaxies.
We thus investigate how the dust temperature and mass obtained from a single
modified black-body depend on the assumptions made on beta. We show that, while
the correlations between dust temperature, galaxy structure and star formation
rate are strongly model dependent, the dust mass scaling relations are much
more reliable, and variations of beta only change the strength of the observed
trends.

skill and luck in resource accumulation. When such competitions are driven by
externalities such as cumulative advantage (CA), the rich-get-richer effect,
little is known with respect to fundamental properties such as their duration
and intensity. In this work we provide a mathematical understanding of how CA
exacerbates the role of luck in detriment of skill in simple and well-studied
competition models. We show, for instance, that if two agents are competing for
resources that arrive sequentially at each time unit, an early stroke of luck
can place the less skilled in the lead for an extremely long period of time, a
phenomenon we call ""struggle of the fittest"". In the absence of CA, the more
skilled quickly prevails despite any early stroke of luck that the less skilled
may have. We prove that duration of a simple skill and luck competition model
exhibit power law tails when CA is present, regardless of skill difference,
which is in sharp contrast to exponential tails when CA is absent. Our findings
have important implications to competitions not only in complex social systems
but also in contexts that leverage such models.

physics ideas is proposed. We describe how the neutrino-neutrino interactions
can be modelled using massive gauge theories. The mass of the gauge bosons is
created by spontaneous symmetry breaking and we show that relationship between
mass, currents and potential gauge is through vector dominance, i.e. $J_\mu =
M^2 A_\mu$. A tiny charge $U(1)$ for neutrinos is turned on for energies around
the temperature of the cosmic neutrinos background which allow the interaction
between neutrinos, above this temperature this interaction disappears. The
magnetic flux is quantized in terms of the hidden charge. We found an
approximate relation between the order parameter and neutrino condensate

of observations as opposed to individual observations. In set classification, a
classification rule is trained with $N$ sets of observations, where each set is
labeled with class information, and the prediction of a class label is
performed also with a set of observations. Data sets for set classification
appear, for example, in diagnostics of disease based on multiple cell nucleus
images from a single tissue. Relevant statistical models for set classification
are introduced, which motivate a set classification framework based on
context-free feature extraction. By understanding a set of observations as an
empirical distribution, we employ a data-driven method to choose those features
which contain information on location and major variation. In particular, the
method of principal component analysis is used to extract the features of major
variation. Multidimensional scaling is used to represent features as
vector-valued points on which conventional classifiers can be applied. The
proposed set classification approaches achieve better classification results
than competing methods in a number of simulated data examples. The benefits of
our method are demonstrated in an analysis of histopathology images of cell
nuclei related to liver cancer.

that is, no ground truth is available. When PageRank and its variants show a
good solution in related subjects, they are applicable only for ranking from
link-structure data. In this work, we focus on unsupervised ranking from
multi-attribute data which is also common in evaluation tasks. To overcome the
challenge, we propose five essential meta-rules for the design and assessment
of unsupervised ranking approaches: scale and translation invariance, strict
monotonicity, linear/nonlinear capacities, smoothness, and explicitness of
parameter size. These meta-rules are regarded as high level knowledge for
unsupervised ranking tasks. Inspired by the works in [8] and [14], we propose a
ranking principal curve (RPC) model, which learns a one-dimensional manifold
function to perform unsupervised ranking tasks on multi-attribute observations.
Furthermore, the RPC is modeled to be a cubic B\'ezier curve with control
points restricted in the interior of a hypercube, thereby complying with all
the five meta-rules to infer a reasonable ranking list. With control points as
the model parameters, one is able to understand the learned manifold and to
interpret the ranking list semantically. Numerical experiments of the presented
RPC model are conducted on two open datasets of different ranking applications.
In comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches, the new model is able to
show more reasonable ranking lists.

problem due to, among other reasons, the high-dimensional multivariate nature
of gene-expression traits. Next to the expression heterogeneity produced by
confounding factors and other sources of unwanted variation, indirect effects
spread throughout genes as a result of genetic, molecular and environmental
perturbations. From a multivariate perspective one would like to adjust for the
effect of all of these factors to end up with a network of direct associations
connecting the path from genotype to phenotype. In this paper we approach this
challenge with mixed graphical Markov models, higher-order conditional
independences and q-order correlation graphs. These models show that additive
genetic effects propagate through the network as function of gene-gene
correlations. Our estimation of the eQTL network underlying a well-studied
yeast data set leads to a sparse structure with more direct genetic and
regulatory associations that enable a straightforward comparison of the genetic
control of gene expression across chromosomes. Interestingly, it also reveals
that eQTLs explain most of the expression variability of network hub genes.

Instantaneous diagonalization, Bogolyubov transformation between two different

derive the occupation number of the induced quasi-particles using the invariant
operator method; in deriving the occupation number we also point out and make
the connection between the Functional Schr\""odinger formalism, quantum kinetic
equation, and Bogolyubov transformation between two different Fock space basis
at equal times and explain the role in which the invariant operator plays.
Using the flat FRW chart of de Sitter spacetime, we show that the different
methods lead to different results: Instantaneous diagonalization leads to a
power law distribution, while the Bogolyubov transformation and Unruh-de Witt
detector both lead to thermal distributions. It is shown that the source of the
discrepancy between the instantaneous diagonalization and Bogolyubov methods is
the fact that there is no notion of well-defined particles in the out vacuum
due to a divergent term. In the Bogolyubov method, this divergent term cancels
leading to the thermal distribution, while in the instantaneous diagonalization
there is no such cancelation. However, to obtain the thermal distribution in
the usual Bogolyubov method, one must use the large mass limit. On physical
grounds, one should expect that only the modes which have been allowed to
sample the horizon would be thermal, thus in the large mass limit these modes
are well within the horizon and, even though they do grow, they remain well
within the horizon due to the mass. Thus one should not expect a thermal
distribution since the modes won't have a chance to thermalize.

GeV-TeV energies is described through synchrotron self-Compton emission up to a
few GeV ($\sim$ 4 GeV) and $\pi^0$ decay products up to TeV energies, although
the emission of synchrotron radiation by muons could contribute to the spectrum
at GeV energies, if they are rapidly accelerated. Muons and $\pi^0$s are
generated in the interactions of accelerated protons with two populations of
seed photons which were reported by Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory: one
population at intermediate state emission with energy peak of 0.15 MeV and
another at low state emission with energy peak of 0.59 MeV. In addition, we
show that the reported observations of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and non

flux compactifications with anti-D3-branes in order to analyze the prospects
for meta-stable de Sitter vacua and brane inflation along the lines of
KKLT/KKLMMT. At the level of the 10d supergravity solution, anti-branes in flux
backgrounds with opposite charge are known to source singular terms in the
energy densities of the bulk fluxes, which led to a debate on the consistency
of such constructions in string theory. A straightforward yet non-trivial check
of the singular solution is to verify that its dimensional reduction in the
large-volume limit reproduces the 4d low-energy dynamics expected from known
results where the anti-branes are treated as a probe. Taking into account the
anti-brane backreaction in the effective scalar potential, we find that both
the volume scaling and the coefficient of the anti-brane uplift term are in
exact agreement with the probe potential if the singular fluxes satisfy a
certain near-brane boundary condition. This condition can be tested explicitly
and may thus help to decide whether flux singularities should be interpreted as
pathological or benign features of flux compactifications with anti-branes.
Throughout the paper, we also comment on a number of subtleties related to the
proper definition of warped effective field theory with anti-branes.

of applying $L$ times the order-optimal scheme for a single request, obtaining
a linear in $L$ scaling of the multicast codeword length. We propose a new

for two objects with a separation of about 1.9 arcsec was performed for the
first time in this study. Our time-series photometric data confirms the finding
of Lohr et al. (2013) that the bright object A is an Algol-type detached
eclipsing binary and the fainter B is a W UMa-type contact eclipsing. Using the
high- resolution optical spectra, we obtained well-defined radial velocity
variations of system A. Furthermore, stationary spectral lines were detected
that must have originated from a further, previously unrecognized stellar
component. It was confirmed by the third object contribution from the light
curve analysis. No spectral feature of the system B was detected, probably due
to motion blur by long exposure time. We obtained the binary parameters and the
absolute dimensions of the systems A and B from light curve synthesis with and
without radial velocities, respectively. The primary and secondary components
of system A have a spectral type of K1 and K5 main sequences, respec- tively.
Two components of system B have nearly the same type of K3 main sequence. Light
variations for both binaries are satisfactorily modeled by using two-spot
models with one starspot on each component. We estimated the distances to
systems A and B individually. Two systems may have similar distances of about
70 pc and seem to be gravitationally bound with a separation of about 130 AU.
In conclusion, we suggest that 1SWASP J093010.78+533859.5 is a quintuple
stellar system with a hierarchical structure of a triple system A(ab)c and a
binary system B(ab).

the said circuit is unknown. We consider, here, the question of how the wiring
diagram of neurons imposes constraints on what neural circuits can compute,
when we cannot assume detailed information on the physiological response
properties of the neurons. We call such constraints -- that arise by virtue of
the connectome -- connectomic constraints on computation. For feedforward
networks equipped with neurons that obey a deterministic spiking neuron model
which satisfies a small number of properties, we ask if just by knowing the
architecture of a network, we can rule out computations that it could be doing,
no matter what response properties each of its neurons may have. We show
results of this form, for certain classes of network architectures. On the
other hand, we also prove that with the limited set of properties assumed for
our model neurons, there are fundamental limits to the constraints imposed by
network structure. Thus, our theory suggests that while connectomic constraints
might restrict the computational ability of certain classes of network
architectures, we may require more elaborate information on the properties of
neurons in the network, before we can discern such results for other classes of
networks.

Results for both structure and thermodynamics are presented and compared with

both approaches within a unified treatment. On balance, RHNC integral equation
theory, even with an isotropic hard-sphere reference system, is found to be a
good compromise between accuracy of the results, computational effort, and
uniform quality to tackle self-assembly processes in patchy colloids of complex

of these imbalance costs on optimal generating expansion decisions of
stochastic units. The proposed model is cast as a mathematical program with
equilibrium constraints, which allows the explicit representation of both the
day-ahead and balancing market-clearing mechanisms. We use the proposed
framework to investigate the effect of two paradigmatic market designs on
investment decisions: a day-ahead market that is cleared following a
conventional cost merit-order principle, and an ideal market-clearing procedure
that determines day-ahead dispatch decisions accounting for their impact on
balancing operation costs. The variability throughout the planning horizon of
the expected stochastic power production and demand level in the day-ahead
market is modeled via a scenario set. Likewise, the uncertainty pertaining to
their corresponding forecast errors, which are to be settled in the balancing
market, is also characterized through scenarios. The main features and results
of the proposed models are discussed using an illustrative two-node example and
a more realistic 24-node case study.

coefficient $\alpha(r)$ at constant temperature $T$, it drifts toward the low
friction end of the system even in the absence of any real physical force $f$.
This phenomenon, which has been previously studied in the context of
non-inertial Brownian dynamics, is termed ""spurious drift"", although the drift
is real and stems from an inertial effect taking place at the short temporal
scales. Here, we study the diffusion of particles in inhomogeneous media within
the framework of the inertial Langevin equation. We demonstrate that the
quantity which characterizes the dynamics with non-uniform $\alpha(r)$ is not
the displacement of the particle $\Delta r=r-r^0$ (where $r^0$ is the initial
position), but rather $\Delta A(r)=A(r)-A(r^0)$, where $A(r)$ is the primitive
function of $\alpha(r)$. We derive expressions relating the mean and variance
of $\Delta A$ to $f$, $T$, and the duration of the dynamics $\Delta t$. For a
constant friction coefficient $\alpha(r)=\alpha$, these expressions reduce to
the well known forms of the force-drift and fluctuation-dissipation relations.
We introduce a very accurate method for Langevin dynamics simulations in
systems with spatially varying $\alpha(r)$, and use the method to validate the
newly derived expressions.

load. A randomized control architecture is proposed, motivated by the need for
decentralized decision making, and the need to avoid synchronization that can
lead to large and detrimental spikes in demand. An aggregate model for a large
number of loads is then developed by examining the mean field limit. A key
innovation is an LTI-system approximation of the aggregate nonlinear model,
with a scalar signal as the input and a measure of the aggregate demand as the
output. This makes the approximation particularly convenient for control design
at the grid level.
  The second half of the paper contains a detailed application of these results
to a network of residential pools. Simulations are provided to illustrate the
accuracy of the approximations and effectiveness of the proposed control
approach.

and phase transition of the superfluid Fermi gas of atoms with a weak
attractive interaction on the canonical noncommutative space. Because the
interaction of a BCS-type superfluid Fermi gas originates from a pair of
Fermionic quasi-particles with opposite momenta and spins, the Hamiltonian of
the Fermi gas on the noncommutative space can be described in terms of the
ordinary creation and annihilation operators related to the commutative space,
while the noncommutative effect appears only in the coefficients of the
interacting Hamiltonian. As a result, we can rigorously solve the energy
spectrum of the Fermi gas on the noncommutative space exactly following the way
adopted on the commutative space without the use of perturbation theory. In
particular, different from the previous results on the noncommutative
degenerate electron gas and superconductor where only the first order
corrections of the ground state energy level and energy gap were derived, we
obtain the nonperturbative energy spectrum for the noncommutative superfluid
Fermi gas, and find that each energy level contains a corrected factor of
cosine function of noncommutative parameters. In addition, our result shows
that the energy gap becomes narrow and the critical temperature of phase
transition from a superfluid state to an ordinary fluid state decreases when
compared with that in the commutative case.

of exergy, which is the generic name for the amount of work obtainable when
some matter is brought to a state of equilibrium with its surroundings by means
of reversible processes.
  It is shown in this paper that a study of the hydrodynamic properties of
available enthalpy leads to a generalization of the global meteorological
available energies previously introduced by Lorenz, Dutton and Pearce. A local
energy cycle is derived without approximation. Moreover, static instabilities
or topography do not prevent this theory from having practical applications.
The concept of available enthalpy is also presented in terms of the potential
change in total entropy. Using the hydrostatic assumption, limited-area
energetics is then rigorously defined, including new boundary fluxes and new
energy components. This innovative approach is especially suitable for the
study of energy conversions between isobaric layers of an open limited
atmospheric domain.
  Numerical evaluations of various energy components are presented for a
hemispheric field of zonal-average temperature. It is further shown that this
new energetic scheme realizes a hierarchical partition of the components so
that the smallest of those available enthalpy reservoirs are almost of the same
magnitude as the kinetic energy. This is actually the fundamental property that
induced Margules to define the primary concept of available kinetic energy in
meteorology.

which are compatible with the theoretical constraints imposed by
temperature-anisotropy driven kinetic instabilities. Recent statistical
analyses based on conditional averaging indicate that near these theoretical
constraints the solar wind protons have typically enhanced temperatures and a
weaker collisionality. Here we carefully analyze the solar wind data and show
that these results are a consequence of superposition of multiple correlations
in the solar wind, namely, they mostly result from the correlation between the
proton temperature and the solar wind velocity and from the superimposed
anti-correlation between the proton temperature anisotropy and the proton
parallel beta in the fast solar wind. Colder and more collisional data are
distributed around temperature isotropy whereas hotter and less collisional
data have a wider range of the temperature anisotropy anti-correlated with the
proton parallel beta with signatures of constraints owing to the
temperature-anisotropy driven instabilities. However, most of the hot and
weakly collisional data, including the hottest and least collisional ones, lies
far from the marginal stability regions. Consequently, we conclude that there
is no clear relation between the enhanced temperatures and instability
constraints and that the conditional averaging used for these analyses must be
used carefully and need to be well tested.

  This paper considers a particular randomized distributed control architecture
introduced in our own recent work. In numerical results it was found that the
associated mean-field model had attractive properties for purposes of control.
In particular, when viewed as an input-output system, its linearization was
found to be minimum phase.
  In this paper we take a closer look at the control model. The results are
summarized as follows:
  (i) The Markov Decision Process framework of Todorov is extended to
continuous time models, in which the ""control cost"" is based on relative
entropy. This is the basis of the construction of a family of controlled
Markovian generators.
  (ii) A decentralized control architecture is proposed in which each agent
evolves as a controlled Markov process. A central authority broadcasts a common
control signal to each agent. The central authority chooses this signal based
on an aggregate scalar output of the Markovian agents.
  (iii) Provided the control-free system is a reversible Markov process, the
following identity holds for the linearization, \[ \text{Real} (G(j\omega)) =
\text{PSD}_Y(\omega)\ge 0, \quad \omega\in\Re, \] where the right hand side

Although PROOF can be used simply from within a ROOT session with no additional

straightforward. Recently great efforts have been spent to make the
provisioning of generic PROOF analysis facilities with zero configuration, with
the added advantages of positively affecting both stability and scalability,
making the deployment operations feasible even for the end user. Since a
growing amount of large-scale computing resources are nowadays made available
by Cloud providers in a virtualized form, we have developed the Virtual
PROOF-based Analysis Facility: a cluster appliance combining the solid CernVM
ecosystem and PoD (PROOF on Demand), ready to be deployed on the Cloud and
leveraging some peculiar Cloud features such as elasticity. We will show how
this approach is effective both for sysadmins, who will have little or no
configuration to do to run it on their Clouds, and for the end users, who are
ultimately in full control of their PROOF cluster and can even easily restart
it by themselves in the unfortunate event of a major failure. We will also show
how elasticity leads to a more optimal and uniform usage of Cloud resources.

a smooth version we call quantile Huber, and compare the resulting greedy

interdependent links and $(ii)$ interdependent links restricted to a maximum
length, $r$. Analytic results are given for each network of networks with
unconstrained dependency links and compared with simulations. For the case of
two spatially embedded networks it was found that only for $r>r_c\approx8$ does
the system undergo a first order phase transition. We find that for treelike
networks of networks $r_c$ significantly decreases as $n$ increases and rapidly
reaches its limiting value, $r=1$. For cases where the dependencies form loops,
such as in random regular networks, we show analytically and confirm through
simulations, that there is a certain fraction of dependent nodes, $q_{max}$,
above which the entire network structure collapses even if a single node is
removed. This $q_{max}$ decreases quickly with $m$, the degree of the random
regular network of networks. Our results show the extreme sensitivity of
coupled spatial networks and emphasize the susceptibility of these networks to
sudden collapse. The theory derived here can be used to find the robustness of
any network of networks where the profile of percolation of a single network is

on their validation in NSOM imaging. Since fluorescent nanodiamonds tend to
decrease steadily in size, we assimilate a nanodiamond-based tip to a
point-like single photon source and compare its ultimate resolution with that
offered by standard metal-coated aperture NSOM tips. We demonstrate both
classically and quantum mechanically that NSOM based on a point-like tip has a
resolving power that is only limited by the scan height over the imaged system
whereas the aperture-tip resolution depends critically on both the scan height
and aperture diameter. This is a consequence of the complex distribution of the
electromagnetic field around the aperture that tends to artificially duplicate
the imaged objects. We show that the point-like tip does not suffer from this
""squint"" and that it rapidly approaches its ultimate resolution in the
near-field as soon its scan height falls below the distance between the two

where interaural time (ITD) and level (ILD) disparities at pure frequency
channels are utilized to identify a position of a sound source. In natural
conditions binaural circuits are exposed to a stimulation by sound waves
originating from multiple, often moving and overlapping sources. Therefore
statistics of binaural cues depend on acoustic properties and the spatial
configuration of the environment. In order to process binaural sounds
efficiently, the auditory system should be adapted to naturally encountered cue
distributions. Statistics of cues encountered naturally and their dependence on
the physical properties of an auditory scene have not been studied before.
Here, we performed binaural recordings of three auditory scenes with varying
spatial properties. We have analyzed empirical cue distributions from each
scene by fitting them with parametric probability density functions which
allowed for an easy comparison of different scenes. Higher order statistics of
binaural waveforms were analyzed by performing Independent Component Analysis
(ICA) and studying properties of learned basis functions. Obtained results can
be related to known neuronal mechanisms and suggest how binaural hearing can be
understood in terms of adaptation to the natural signal statistics.

variants of an elastoplastic model, paying particular attention to spatial
correlations and time fluctuations of, e.g., local stresses. The model is based
on the local alternation between an elastic regime and plastic events during
which the local stress is redistributed. The importance of a fully tensorial
description of the stress and of the inclusion of (coarse-grained) convection
in the model is investigated; scalar and tensorial models yield very similar
results, while convection enhances fluctuations and breaks the spurious
symmetry between the flow and velocity gradient directions, for instance when
shear localisation is observed. Besides, correlation lengths measured with
diverse protocols are discussed. One class of such correlation lengths simply
scale with the spacing between homogeneously distributed, simultaneous plastic
events. This leads to a scaling of the correlation length with the shear rate
as $\dot{\gamma}^{\frac{-1}{2}}$ in 2D in the athermal regime, regardless of
the details of the model. The radius of the cooperative disk, defined as the
near-field region in which plastic events induce a stress redistribution that
is not amenable to a mean-field treatment, notably follows this scaling. On the

susceptibility and its dependence on the system size and the shear rate are

The new results deal with the case of a narrow gap $s \ll w$, where the field
penetration from the inner edges is facilitated by large flux focusing. Upon
reducing the gap width $2s$, we observe a considerable rearrangement of the

found to correlate with other well-known star formation tracers, it has widely
been used as a star formation rate (SFR) tracer. There are, however, studies
that challenge the accuracy and reliability of the 8 {\mu}m emission as a SFR
tracer. Our study, part of the Herschel M33 Extended Survey (HERM33ES) open
time key program, aims at addressing this issue by analyzing the infrared
emission from the nearby spiral galaxy M33 at the high spatial scale of 75 pc.
Combining data from the Herschel Space Observatory and the Spitzer Space
Telescope we find that the 8 {\mu}m emission is better correlated with the 250
{\mu}m emission, which traces cold interstellar gas, than with the 24 {\mu}m
emission. The L(8)/L(24) ratio is highly depressed in 24 {\mu}m luminous
regions, which correlate with known HII regions. We also compare our results
with the dust emission models by Draine & Li (2007). We confirm that the
depression of 8 {\mu}m PAH emission near star-forming regions is higher than
what is predicted by models; this is possibly an effect of increased stellar
radiation from young stars destroying the dust grains responsible for the 8
{\mu}m emission as already suggested by other authors. We find that the
majority of the 8 {\mu}m emission is fully consistent with heating by the
diffuse interstellar medium, similar to what recently determined for the dust
emission in M31 by Draine at al. (2013). We also find that the fraction of 8
{\mu}m emission associated with the diffuse interstellar radiation field ranges
between 60% and 80% and is 40% larger than the diffuse fraction at 24 {\mu}m.

for any Frobenius Lie algebra which is a biparabolic subalgebra of a semisimple
Lie algebra; but may fail in general.
  Call $\mathfrak a$ regular if there are no proper semi-invariant polynomial
functions on $\mathfrak a^*$ and if the subalgebra of invariant functions is
polynomial. In this case there are no known counter-examples to integrality. It
is shown that if $\mathfrak a$ is the canonical truncation of a biparabolic
subalgebra of a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ which is regular and admits an
adapted pair $(h,\eta)$, then the eigenvalues of $ad \ h$ on $\mathfrak a$ lie
in $\frac{1}{m}\mathbb Z$, where $m$ is a coefficient of a simple root in the

  Let $\mathfrak a$ be a regular Lie algebra admitting an adapted pair

knowledge of the relation between the generators for the invariant polynomial
functions on $\mathfrak a^*$ and on $\mathfrak a^*_\mathbb Z$ can then lead to
establishing the integrality of $(h,\eta)$. This method is used to show the

dynamical rather than statically pinned to the support and can be observed
mostly via time lapsing. The instantaneous snapshots of the periodic moir\'e
pattern already at low temperature are weakly disordered lacking the apparent
sharpness of the time averaged pattern and scanning tunneling microscopy

interface between two solids is central to fields ranging from biomechanics to
seismology. This failure is mediated by the propagation along the interface of
various types of rupture fronts, covering a wide range of velocities. Among
them are so-called slow fronts, which are recently discovered fronts much
slower than the materials' sound speeds. Despite intense modelling activity,
the mechanisms underlying slow fronts remain elusive. Here, we introduce a
multi-scale model capable of reproducing both the transition from fast to slow
fronts in a single rupture event and the short-time slip dynamics observed in
recent experiments. We identify slow slip immediately following the arrest of a
fast front as a phenomenon sufficient for the front to propagate further at a
much slower pace. Whether slow fronts are actually observed is controlled both
by the interfacial stresses and by the width of the local distribution of
forces among micro-junctions. Our results show that slow fronts are
qualitatively different from faster fronts. Since the transition from fast to
slow fronts is potentially as generic as slow slip, we anticipate that it might
occur in the wide range of systems in which slow slip has been reported,
including seismic faults.

covering a time span of up to 6 days. Flux emergence is driven by a bottom
boundary condition that advects a semi-torus of magnetic field with $1.7 \times
10^{22}$ Mx flux into the computational domain. The simulations show that, even
in the absense of twist, the magnetic flux is able the rise through the upper
$15.5$ Mm of the convection zone and emerge into the photosphere to form spots.
We find that spot formation is sensitive to the persistence of upflows at the
bottom boundary footpoints, i.e. a continuing upflow would prevent spot
formation. In addition, the presence of a torus-aligned flow (such flow into
the retrograde direction is expected from angular momentum conservation during
the rise of flux ropes through the convection zone) leads to a significant
asymmetry between the pair of spots, with the spot corresponding to the leading
spot on the Sun being more axisymmetric and coherent, but also forming with a
delay relative to the following spot. The spot formation phase transitions
directly into a decay phase. Subsurface flows fragment the magnetic field and
lead to intrusions of almost field free plasma underneath the photosphere. When
such intrusions reach photospheric layers, the spot fragments. The time scale
for spot decay is comparable to the longest convective time scales present in
the simulation domain. We find that the dispersal of flux from a simulated spot
in the first two days of the decay phase is consistent with self-similar decay
by turbulent diffusion.

Euler-Mascheroni constant and the Glaisher-Kinkelin constant. Like Wallis
formula, the generalizations are slowly convergent, but their importance is
aesthetic as the fomulas probably please the eye of the mathematical beholder.

high dimensional information sources for the purpose of situation awareness in
the maritime environment. In response to the requirement for human decision
support aids to reduce information overload (and specifically, data amenable to
inter-point relative similarity measures) appropriate to the below-water
maritime domain, we are investigating a preliminary prototype topographic
visualisation model. The focus of the current paper is on the mathematical
problem of exploiting a relative dissimilarity representation of signals in a
visual informatics mapping model, driven by real-world sonar systems. An
independent source model is used to analyse the sonar beams from which a simple
probabilistic input model to represent uncertainty is mapped to a latent
visualisation space where data uncertainty can be accommodated. The use of
euclidean and non-euclidean measures are used and the motivation for future use
of non-euclidean measures is made. Concepts are illustrated using a simulated
64 beam weak SNR dataset with realistic sonar targets.

Lorentz law of force are a complete and consistent set of equations. Not only
are these five equations fully compatible with special relativity, they also
conform with conservation laws of energy, momentum, and angular momentum. We
demonstrate consistency with the conservation laws by showing that, when a beam
of light enters a magnetic dielectric, a fraction of the incident linear (or
angular) momentum pours into the medium at a rate determined by the Abraham
momentum density, ExH/c^2, and the group velocity V_g of the electromagnetic
field. The balance of the incident, reflected, and transmitted momenta is
subsequently transferred to the medium as force (or torque) at the leading edge
of the beam, which propagates through the medium with velocity V_g. Our
analysis does not require ""hidden"" momenta to comply with the conservation
laws, nor does it dissolve into ambiguities with regard to the nature of
electromagnetic momentum in ponderable media. The linear and angular momenta of
the electromagnetic field are clearly associated with the Abraham momentum, and
the phase and group refractive indices (n_p and n_g) play distinct yet
definitive roles in the expressions of force, torque, and momentum densities.

has countably infinite roots on the complex plane. This paper considers linear
DDEs that are on the verge of instability, i.e. a pair of roots of the
characteristic equation lie on the imaginary axis of the complex plane, and all
other roots have negative real parts. It is shown that, when small noise
perturbations are present, the probability law of the dynamics can be
approximated by the probability law of a one dimensional stochastic
differential equation (SDE) without delay. This is advantageous because
equations without delay are easier to simulate and one-dimensional SDE are
analytically tractable. When the perturbations are also linear, it is shown
that the stability depends on a specific complex number. The theory is applied
to study oscillators with delayed feedback. Some errors in other articles that
use multiscale approach are pointed out.
