energy for compressible, hydrostatic flow, where the sum of this available
energy and the kinetic energy is called pseudo-energy. He demonstrated that for
a special basic state the small-amplitude limit of the generalized available
potential energy reduces to the well-known approximate form of Lorenz (1955)
expressed in a pressure vertical coordinate.
  Other forms of available energies exist in atmospheric energetics and in
thermodynamics, where the name exergy has been coined by Rant (1956) to denote
the maximum work that can be extracted from any system when it is subject to
some constraints (adiabatic transformations or constant total energy for
instance).
  The purpose of this note is to show that the specific available enthalpy
function denoted by $a_h = (h - h_r) - T_r \: (s - s_r)$ in Marquet (1991) can
be obtained from the generalized approach of Shepherd for another basic state.
This special form of pseudo-energy also leads to the global hydrostatic
concepts of Dutton (1973) and Pichler (1977). The function $a_h$ only depends
on the specific enthalpy $h$ and entropy $s$ at any point, the values $h_r$ and
$s_r$ refer to the special dead state at temperature $T_r$ and pressure $p_r$.
  It is explained that for another choice of the basic state, the generalized
expression of Shepherd reduces with a good accuracy to the approximate
functions introduced by Pearce (1978) or Blackburn (1983) in meteorology and
Thomson (1853, Lord Kelvin) in thermodynamics.

neighbors and past experiences. A decentralized influence method is then
developed to maintain existing social influence between individuals (i.e.,
without isolating peers in the group) and to influence the social group to a
common desired state (i.e., within a convex hull spanned by social leaders).
Mittag-Leffler stability methods are used to prove asymptotic stability of the
networked fractional-order system.

radio systems which exploit a large number of channels free from primary users.
In such systems, transmitters may rapidly change the selected (channel, rate)
pair to opportunistically learn and track the pair offering the highest
throughput. We formulate the problem of sequential channel and rate selection
as an online optimization problem, and show its equivalence to a {\it
structured} Multi-Armed Bandit problem. The structure stems from inherent
properties of the achieved throughput as a function of the selected channel and
rate. We derive fundamental performance limits satisfied by {\it any} channel
and rate adaptation algorithm, and propose algorithms that achieve (or
approach) these limits. In turn, the proposed algorithms optimally exploit the
inherent structure of the throughput. We illustrate the efficiency of our
algorithms using both test-bed and simulation experiments, in both stationary
and non-stationary radio environments. In stationary environments, the packet
successful transmission probabilities at the various channel and rate pairs do
not evolve over time, whereas in non-stationary environments, they may evolve.
In practical scenarios, the proposed algorithms are able to track the best
channel and rate quite accurately without the need of any explicit measurement
and feedback of the quality of the various channels.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stu351",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been proposed that the first, intermediate-mass ($\approx
10^{5-6}~M_\odot$) black holes might form through direct collapse of unpolluted
gas in atomic-cooling halos exposed to a strong Lyman-Werner (LW) or
near-infrared (NIR) radiation. As these systems are expected to be
Compton-thick, photons above 13.6 eV are largely absorbed and re-processed into
lower energy bands. It follows that direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) are
very bright in the LW/NIR bands, typically outshining small high-redshift
galaxies by more than 10 times. Once the first DCBHs form, they then trigger a
runaway process of further DCBH formation, producing a sudden rise in their
cosmic mass density. The universe enters the ""DCBH era"" at $z \approx 20$ when
a large fraction of atomic-cooling halos are experiencing DCBH formation. By
combining the clustering properties of the radiation sources with Monte Carlo
simulations we show that in this scenario the DCBH mass density rises from
$\sim 5$~$M_\odot$ Mpc$^{-3}$ at $z\sim 30$ to the peak value $\sim5\times10^5
M_\odot$ Mpc$^{-3}$ at $z \sim 14$ in our fiducial model. However, the
abundance of \textit{active} (accreting) DCBHs drops after $z \sim 14$, as gas
in the potential formation sites (unpolluted halos with virial temperature
slightly above $10^4$~K) is photoevaporated. This effect almost completely
suppresses DCBH formation after $z\sim 13$. The DCBH formation era lasts only
$\approx 150$ Myr, but it might crucially provide the seeds of the supermassive
black holes (SMBHs) powering $z\sim6$ quasars.

expected estimation error and its outage probability can be chosen for
estimation quality assessment. In this paper and in order to get the estimation
error outage, we provide means to characterize the stationary probability

the particular case of the i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channels, upper and lower

we demonstrate explicitly that in agreement with Ho\v{r}ava conjecture, in the

model of the two - component Weyl fermions in the vicinity of the topologically

gravitational field given by the emergent veirbein. Both these fields (the
emergent gauge field and the emergent gravitational field) originate from
certain collective excitations of the original system. We speculate, that the

response to perturbations. We use examples from aquatic (electric fish station
keeping and jamming avoidance), terrestrial (cockroach wall following) and
aerial environments (flight control in moths) to highlight how one can use
control theory to understand how feedback mechanisms interact with the physical
dynamics of animals to determine their stability and response to sensory inputs

input, neural processing, and motor dynamics, the output of which feeds back to
the sensory inputs. Collectively, the interaction of these systems in a closed

measurements, which are preferable from the point of view of theory, seem to be
difficult to implement experimentally. We demonstrate that, when using a
particular type of generalized energy measurements, the resulting work
statistics is simply related to that of projective measurements. This relation
between the two work statistics entails the existence of modified transient
fluctuation relations. The modifications are exclusively determined by the
errors incurred in the generalized energy measurements. They are universal in
the sense that they do not depend on the force protocol. Particularly simple
expressions for the modified Crooks relation and Jarzynski equality are found
for Gaussian energy measurements. These can be obtained by a sequence of
sufficiently many generalized measurements which need not be Gaussian. In
accordance with the central limit theorem, this leads to an effective error
reduction in the individual measurements, and even yields a projective
measurement in the limit of infinite repetitions.

central problem in computational statistics and machine learning. This paper
describes discrete particle variational inference (DPVI), a new approach that
combines key strengths of Monte Carlo, variational and search-based techniques.
DPVI is based on a novel family of particle-based variational approximations
that can be fit using simple, fast, deterministic search techniques. Like Monte
Carlo, DPVI can handle multiple modes, and yields exact results in a
well-defined limit. Like unstructured mean-field, DPVI is based on optimizing a
lower bound on the partition function; when this quantity is not of intrinsic
interest, it facilitates convergence assessment and debugging. Like both Monte
Carlo and combinatorial search, DPVI can take advantage of factorization,
sequential structure, and custom search operators. This paper defines DPVI
particle-based approximation family and partition function lower bounds, along
with the sequential DPVI and local DPVI algorithm templates for optimizing
them. DPVI is illustrated and evaluated via experiments on lattice Markov
Random Fields, nonparametric Bayesian mixtures and block-models, and parametric
as well as non-parametric hidden Markov models. Results include applications to
real-world spike-sorting and relational modeling problems, and show that DPVI
can offer appealing time/accuracy trade-offs as compared to multiple
alternatives.

curves, surfaces) varying over a continuum, are frequently encountered in
various applications. While many statistical tools have been developed for
functional data analysis, the issue of smoothing all functional observations
simultaneously is less studied. Existing methods often focus on smoothing each
individual function separately, at the risk of removing important systematic
patterns common across functions. We propose a nonparametric Bayesian approach
to smooth all functional observations simultaneously and nonparametrically. In
the proposed approach, we assume that the functional observations are
independent Gaussian processes subject to a common level of measurement errors,
enabling the borrowing of strength across all observations. Unlike most
Gaussian process regression models that rely on pre-specified structures for
the covariance kernel, we adopt a hierarchical framework by assuming a Gaussian
process prior for the mean function and an Inverse-Wishart process prior for
the covariance function. These prior assumptions induce an automatic
mean-covariance estimation in the posterior inference in addition to the
simultaneous smoothing of all observations. Such a hierarchical framework is
flexible enough to incorporate functional data with different characteristics,
including data measured on either common or uncommon grids, and data with
either stationary or nonstationary covariance structures. Simulations and real
data analysis demonstrate that, in comparison with alternative methods, the
proposed Bayesian approach achieves better smoothing accuracy and comparable
mean-covariance estimation results. Furthermore, it can successfully retain the
systematic patterns in the functional observations that are usually neglected
by the existing functional data analyses based on individual-curve smoothing.

breathers, rotating and pendulum-like librating, are both predicted by the
variational approach, and confirmed by the numerical simulation.The spiraling
elliptic breathers can rotate even though they have no initial orbital angular
momentum (OAM). Due to the linear anisotropy of the media, the OAM is no longer
conserved. Therefore, the angular velocity is found to be not a constant but a
periodic function of the propagation distance. When the linear anisotropy is
large enough, the spiraling elliptic breathers can librate like the pendulum.
The spiraling elliptic breathers exist in the media with not only the saturable
nonlinearity but also the nonlocal nonlinearity, as a matter of fact, they are
universal in the nonlinear media with the linear anisotropy.

primes, we determine the mean number of 2-torsion elements in the class groups
and narrow class groups of these cubic fields when ordered by their absolute
discriminants.
  For an order $\cal O$ in a cubic field, we study the three groups: $\rm
Cl_2(\cal O)$, the group of ideal classes of $\cal O$ of order 2; $\rm
Cl^+_2(\cal O)$, the group of narrow ideal classes of $\cal O$ of order 2; and
${\cal I}_2(\cal O)$, the group of ideals of $\cal O$ of order 2. We prove that
the mean value of the difference $|\rm Cl_2({\cal O})|-\frac14|{\cal I}_2(\cal
O)|$ is always equal to $1$, whether one averages over the maximal orders in
real cubic fields, over all orders in real cubic fields, or indeed over any
family of real cubic orders defined by local conditions. For the narrow class
group, we prove that the mean value of the difference $|\rm Cl^+_2({\cal
O})|-|{\cal I}_2(\cal O)|$ is equal to $1$ for any such family. For any family
of complex cubic orders defined by local conditions, we prove similarly that
the mean value of the difference $|\rm Cl_2(\mathcal O)|-\frac12|{\cal
I}_2(\cal O)|$ is always equal to $1$, independent of the family.
  The determination of these mean numbers allows us to prove a number of
further results as by-products. Most notably, we prove---in stark contrast to
the case of quadratic fields---that: 1) a positive proportion of cubic fields
have odd class number; 2) a positive proportion of real cubic fields have
isomorphic 2-torsion in the class group and the narrow class group; and 3) a
positive proportion of real cubic fields contain units of mixed real signature.
We also show that a positive proportion of real cubic fields have narrow class
group strictly larger than the class group, and thus a positive proportion of
real cubic fields do not possess units of every possible real signature.

inferences that may violate predefined privacy constraints. The attributes
whose association should not be inferred, are defined as having security

works on a logical schema with given security dependent sets and aims to
prohibit the inference of the association among the elements of these sets. It
is also proven that the decomposition technique generates a secure logical

  Algorithm","16 pages, 11 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent studies on sparse modeling, non-convex penalties have received
considerable attentions due to their superiorities on sparsity-inducing over
the convex counterparts. Compared with the convex optimization approaches,
however, the non-convex approaches have more challenging convergence analysis.
In this paper, we study the convergence of a non-convex iterative thresholding
algorithm for solving sparse recovery problems with a certain class of
non-convex penalties, whose corresponding thresholding functions are
discontinuous with jump discontinuities. Therefore, we call the algorithm the
iterative jumping thresholding (IJT) algorithm. The finite support and sign
convergence of IJT algorithm is firstly verified via taking advantage of such
jump discontinuity. Together with the assumption of the introduced restricted
Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (rKL) property, then the strong convergence of IJT
algorithm can be proved.Furthermore, we can show that IJT algorithm converges
to a local minimizer at an asymptotically linear rate under some additional
conditions. Moreover, we derive a posteriori computable error estimate, which
can be used to design practical terminal rules for the algorithm. It should be
pointed out that the $l_q$ quasi-norm ($0<q<1$) is an important subclass of the
class of non-convex penalties studied in this paper. In particular, when
applied to the $l_q$ regularization, IJT algorithm can converge to a local
minimizer with an asymptotically linear rate under certain concentration
conditions. We provide also a set of simulations to support the correctness of
theoretical assertions and compare the time efficiency of IJT algorithm for the
$l_{q}$ regularization ($q=1/2, 2/3$) with other known typical algorithms like
the iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm and the iterative
reweighted $l_{1}$ minimization (IRL1) algorithm.

UMa during 2011 and 2012, which showed the existence of persistent negative
superhumps even during the superoutburst. We performed two-dimensional period
analysis of its light curves by using a method called ""least absolute shrinkage
and selection operator"" (Lasso) and ""phase dispersion minimization"" (PDM)
analysis, and we found that the period of negative superhumps systematically
changed between a superoutburst and the next superoutburst. The trend of the
period change can beinterpreted as reflecting the change of the disk radius.
This change of the disk radius is in good agreement with the predicted change
of the disk radius by the thermal-tidal instability (TTI) model. The normal
outbursts within a supercycle showed a general trend that the rising rate to
maximum becomes slower as the next superoutburst approaches. The change can be
interpreted as the consequence of the increased gas-stream flow onto the inner
region of the disk as the result of the tilted disk. Some of the superoutbursts
were found to be triggered by a precursor normal outburst when the positive
superhumps appeared to develop. The positive and negative superhumps co-existed
during the superoutburst. The positive superhumps were prominent only during
four or five days after the supermaximum, while the signal of the negative
superhumps became strong after the middle phase of the superoutburst plateau. A
simple combination of the positive and negative superhumps was found to be
insufficient in reproducing the complex profile variation. We were able to
detect the developing phase of positive superhumps (stage A superhumps) for the
first time in ER UMa-type dwarf novae. Using the period of stage A superhumps,
we obtained a mass ratio of 0.100(15), which indicates that ER UMa is on the
ordinary evolutional track of CVs.

0.4eV. The electrical resistivity has a logarithmic temperature dependence up
to room temperature due to Kondo scattering of a dilute free electron gas off
superparamagnetic impurities. The origin of the electron gas is extrinsic due
to disorder or off-stoichiometry. Density functional theory calculations of the
electronic structure are in excellent agreement with electron energy loss,
optical, and x-ray absorption experiments. Fe2TiSi may find applications as a
thermoelectric material.

connection with the search for efficient thermoelectric materials. These
compounds constitute networked cages consisting of nano-scale
tetrakaidecahedrons (14 hedrons) and dodecahedrons (12 hedrons), in which the
group 1 or 2 elements in the periodic table are encaged as the so-called
rattling guest atom. It is remarkable that, though these compounds have
crystalline cubic-structure, they exhibit glass-like phonon thermal
conductivity over the whole temperature range depending on the states of
rattling guest atoms in the tetrakaidecahedron. In addition, these compounds
show unusual glass-like specific heats and THz-frequency phonon dynamics,
providing a remarkable broad peak almost identical to those observed in
topologically disordered amorphous materials or structural glasses, the
so-called Boson peak. An efficient thermoelectric effect is realized in
compounds showing these glass-like characteristics. This decade, a number of
experimental works dealing with type-I clathrate compounds have been published.
These are diffraction experiments, thermal and spectroscopic experiments in
addition to those based on heat and electronic transport. These form the raw
materials for this article based on advances this decade. The subject of this
article involves interesting phenomena from the viewpoint of not only physics
but also from the view point of the practical problem of elaborating efficient
thermoelectric materials. This review presents a survey of a wide range of
experimental investigations of type-I clathrate compounds, together with a
review of theoretical interpretations of the peculiar thermal and dynamic
properties observed in these materials.

the Bandits with Knapsacks (BwK) model of Badanidiyuru et al.[2013]. We also

linear contextual extension of the MAB model. We demonstrate that a natural and
simple extension of the UCB family of algorithms for MAB provides a polynomial
time algorithm that has near-optimal regret guarantees for this substantially
more general model, and matches the bounds provided by Badanidiyuru et
al.[2013] for the special case of BwK, which is quite surprising. We also
provide computationally more efficient algorithms by establishing interesting

flexible, reconfigurable and adaptable to change in addition to being developed
rapidly. As a consequence, designing systems to cater for evolution is becoming
critical to their success. To be able to cope with change, systems must have
the capability of reuse and the ability to adapt as and when necessary to
changes in requirements. Allowing systems to be self-describing is one way to
facilitate this. To address the issues of reuse in designing evolvable systems,
this paper proposes a so-called description-driven approach to systems design.
This approach enables new versions of data structures and processes to be
created alongside the old, thereby providing a history of changes to the
underlying data models and enabling the capture of provenance data. The
efficacy of the description-driven approach is exemplified by the CRISTAL
project. CRISTAL is based on description-driven design principles; it uses
versions of stored descriptions to define various versions of data which can be
stored in diverse forms. This paper discusses the need for capturing holistic
system description when modelling large-scale distributed systems.

by live performance data from the cloud service provider, or ideally an
independent third-party accountability and assurance service that would
communicate up-to-date information relating to service performance and
dependability. By combining assurance measures with a remediation scheme, cloud
service providers could both signal dependability to customers and the wider
marketplace and provide customers, auditors and regulators with a mechanism for
determining accountability in the event of failure or non-compliance. As a
result, the trustmarks would convey to consumers of cloud services and other
stakeholders that strong assurance and accountability measures are in place for
the service in question and thereby address trust and confidence issues in

and excellent candidates to investigate the dust evolution under the existence
of a pressure bump. A pressure bump at the outer edge of the cavity allows dust
grains from the outer regions to stop their rapid inward migration towards the
star and efficiently grow to millimetre sizes. Dynamical interactions with
planet(s) have been one of the most exciting theories to explain the clearing
of the inner disk. We look for evidence of the presence of millimetre dust
particles in transition disks by measuring their spectral index with new and
available photometric data. We investigate the influence of the size of the
dust depleted cavity on the disk integrated millimetre spectral index. We
present the 3mm photometric observations carried out with PdBI of four
transition disks: LkHa330, UXTauA, LRLL31, and LRLL67. We use available values
of their fluxes at 345GHz to calculate their spectral index, as well as the
spectral index for a sample of twenty transition disks. We compare the
observations with two kind of models. In the first set of models, we consider
coagulation and fragmentation of dust in a disk in which a cavity is formed by
a massive planet located at different positions. The second set of models
assumes disks with truncated inner parts at different radius and with power-law
dust size distributions, where the maximum size of grains is calculated
considering turbulence as the source of destructive collisions. We show that
the integrated spectral index is higher for transition disks than for regular
protoplanetary disks. For transition disks, the probability that the measured
spectral index is positively correlated with the cavity radius is 95%. High
angular resolution imaging of transition disks is needed to distinguish between
the dust trapping scenario and the truncated disk case.

significantly improved by asynchronous submission of queries/requests well
ahead of the point where the results are needed, so that results are likely to

writing applications to exploit asynchronous query submission is tedious and
error-prone. In this paper we address the issue of automatically transforming a
program written assuming synchronous query submission, to one that exploits
asynchronous query submission. Our program transformation method is based on
data flow analysis and is framed as a set of transformation rules. Our rules
can handle query executions within loops, unlike some of the earlier work in
this area. We also present a novel approach that, at runtime, can combine
multiple asynchronous requests into batches, thereby achieving the benefits of
batching in addition to that of asynchronous submission. We have built a tool
that implements our transformation techniques on Java programs that use JDBC
calls; our tool can be extended to handle Web service calls. We have carried
out a detailed experimental study on several real-life applications, which
shows the effectiveness of the proposed rewrite techniques, both in terms of
their applicability and the performance gains achieved.

of necessary domains of energy to excite typical nuclear processes. Thus the
necessary formulas referring to previous calculations of nuclear cross-sections

increase at temperature decreasing below the Curie temperature. Then as can be

been found for a sample of black-hole X-ray binaries (BHBs) in their low/hard
states, which can roughly be explained by the coupled model of jet and
radiatively inefficient advection dominated accretion flow. However, more and
more `outliers' were found in last few years, which evidently deviate from the
universal radio-X-ray correlation and usually show a much steeper correlation
with an index of ~1.4. Based on simple physical assumptions, the radiatively
efficient accretion flows are speculated to exist in these `outliers'. In this
work, we test this issue by modelling the `outliers' track based on the
radiatively efficient disc-corona model and the hybrid jet model. We find that
our model predicts a steeper radio--X-ray correlation with slopes >~1.2 for the
typical viscosity parameter of \alpha~0.05-0.2. In particular, the slope is
~1.4 for the case of \alpha~0.1, which is consistent with the observational

the generator of special conformal transformation in the light-ray direction.
This representation allows one to study solutions of this equation in a very
simple and mathematically consistent manner. Generalizing this result, we show
that all heavy-light evolution kernels that appear in the renormalization of
higher-twist B-meson distribution amplitudes can be written in the same form.

Concurrently the laser technology has undergone dramatic revolutions, providing

symbiosis between direct observations and laboratory investigation is
instrumental in the progress of astrophysics. We believe that this remains true
in cosmology. Current frontier phenomena related to particle astrophysics and
cosmology typically involve one or more of the following conditions: (1)
extremely high energy events; (2) very high density, high temperature
processes; (3) super strong field environments. Laboratory experiments using
high intensity lasers can calibrate astrophysical observations, investigate
underlying dynamics of astrophysical phenomena, and probe fundamental physics
in extreme limits. In this article we give an overview of the exciting prospect

magnetars release enormous energy in a short time interval. Their power can be
explained by catastrophic instabilities occurring in the magnetic field
configuration and the subsequent magnetic reconnection. By analogy with the
coronal mass ejection (CME) events on the Sun, we develop a theoretical model
via an analytic approach for magnetar giant flares. In this model, the rotation
and/or displacement of the crust causes the field to twist and deform, leading
to flux rope formation in the magnetosphere and energy accumulation in the
related configuration. When the energy and helicity stored in the configuration
reach a threshold, the system loses its equilibrium, the flux rope is ejected
outward in a catastrophic way, and magnetic reconnection helps the catastrophe
develop to a plausible eruption. By taking SGR 1806 - 20 as an example, we
calculate the free magnetic energy released in such an eruptive process and
find that it is more than $10^{47}$ ergs, which is enough to power a giant
flare. The released free magnetic energy is converted into radiative energy,
kinetic energy and gravitational energy of the flux rope. We calculated the
light curves of the eruptive processes for the giant flares of SGR 1806 - 20,
SGR 0526-66 and SGR 1900+14, and compared them with the observational data. The
calculated light curves are in good agreement with the observed light curves of
giant flares.

equivalent the Gauss and Appel principle are not the only way to deduce the
equations of motion of the nonholonomic systems. Instead of them, here we
consider the generalization of the Hamiltonian principle for nonholonomic
systems with nonzero transpositional relations.
  By applying this variational principle which takes into the account
transpositional relations different from the classical ones we deduce the
equations of motion for the nonholonomic systems with constraints that in
general are nonlinear in the velocity. These equations of motion coincide,
except perhaps in a zero Lebesgue measure set, with the classical differential
equations deduced with d'Alembert-Lagrange principle.
  We provide a new point of view on the transpositional relations for the
constrained mechanical systems: the virtual variations can produce zero or
non-zero transpositional relations. In particular the independent virtual
variations can produce non-zero transpositional relations. For the
unconstrained mechanical systems the virtual variations always produce zero
transpositional relations.
  We conjecture that the existence of the nonlinear constraints in the velocity
must be sought outside of the Newtonian model.
  All our results are illustrated with precise examples.

\emph{cyclic complexity}, which counts the number of conjugacy classes of
factors of length $n$ of an infinite word $x.$ We extend the well-known
Morse-Hedlund theorem to the setting of cyclic complexity by showing that a
word is ultimately periodic if and only if it has bounded cyclic complexity.
Unlike most complexity functions, cyclic complexity distinguishes between
Sturmian words of different slopes. We prove that if $x$ is a Sturmian word and
$y$ is a word having the same cyclic complexity of $x,$ then up to renaming
letters, $x$ and $y$ have the same set of factors. In particular, $y$ is also
Sturmian of slope equal to that of $x.$ Since $c_x(n)=1$ for some $n\geq 1$
implies $x$ is periodic, it is natural to consider the quantity
$\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty} c_x(n).$ We show that if $x$ is a Sturmian word,
then $\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty} c_x(n)=2.$ We prove however that this is
not a characterization of Sturmian words by exhibiting a restricted class of
Toeplitz words, including the period-doubling word, which also verify this same

in-plane/out-of-plane decoupled layers deposited on nonmagnetic buffer layers

that surface chemistry proceeds via diffusive mechanisms of H atoms weakly
bound (physisorbed) to the surface. Until recently, however, it was unknown
whether atoms heavier than hydrogen could diffuse rapidly enough on
interstellar grains to react with other accreted species. In addition, models
still require simple reduction as well as oxidation reactions to occur on
grains to explain the abundances of various molecules. In this paper we
investigate O-atom diffusion and reactivity on a variety of astrophysically
relevant surfaces (water ice of three different morphologies, silicate, and
graphite) in the 6.5 - 25 K temperature range. Experimental values were used to
derive a diffusion law that emphasizes that O atoms diffuse by quantum
mechanical tunnelling at temperatures as low as 6.5 K. The rate of diffusion on
each surface, based on modelling results, were calculated and an empirical law
is given as a function of the surface temperature. Relative diffusion rates are
k_H2Oice > k_sil > k_graph >> k_expected. The implications of an efficient
O-atom diffusion over astrophysically relevant time-scales are discussed. Our
findings show that O atoms can scan any available reaction partners (e.g.,
either another H atom, if available, or a surface radical like O or OH) at a
faster rate than that of accretion. Also, as dense clouds mature H2 becomes far
more abundant than H and the O/H ratio grows, the reactivity of O atoms on
grains is such that O becomes one of the dominant reactive partners together
with H.

(QES) systems. In one dimension, QES states assume the form $\Psi(x) =x^\gamma
P_d(x) {\cal A}(x)$, where ${\cal A}(x) > 0$ is known in closed form, and
$P_d(x)$ is a polynomial to be determined. That is ${{\Psi(x)}\over
{x^\gamma{\cal A}(x)}} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n$ truncates. The extension of
this ""truncation"" procedure to non-QES states corresponds to the Hill
determinant method, which is unstable when the {\it reference} function assumes
the physical asymptotic form. Recently, Handy and Vrinceanu introduced the
Orthogonal Polynomial Projection Quantization (OPPQ) method which has non of
these problems, allowing for a unified analysis of QES and non-QES states. OPPQ
uses a non-orthogonal basis constructed from the orthonormal polynomials of
${\cal A}$: $\Psi(x) = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \Omega_j {\cal P}^{(j)}(x) {\cal
A}(x)$, where $\langle {\cal P}^{(j_1)}|{\cal A}|{\cal P}^{(j_2)} \rangle =
\delta_{j_1,j_2}$, and $\Omega_j = \langle {\cal P}^{(j)}|\Psi\rangle$. For
systems admitting a moment equation representation, such as those considered
here, these coefficients can be readily determined. The OPPQ quantization
condition, $\Omega_{j} = 0$, is exact for QES states (provided $j \geq d+1$);
and is computationally stable, and exponentially convergent, for non-QES
states. OPPQ provides an alternate explanation to the Bender-Dunne (BD)
orthogonal polynomial formalism for identifying QES states: they correlate with
an anomalous kink behavior in the order of the finite difference moment
equation associated with the $\Phi = x^\gamma {\cal A}(x) \Psi(x)$ {\it
Bessis}-representation (i.e. a spontaneous change in the degrees of freedom of
the system).

description-driven approach enables new versions of data structures and
processes to be created alongside the old, thereby providing a history of
changes to the underlying data models and enabling the capture of provenance
data. This description-driven approach is advocated in this paper in which a
system called CRISTAL is presented. CRISTAL is based on description-driven
principles; it can use previous versions of stored descriptions to define
various versions of data which can be stored in various forms. To demonstrate
the efficacy of this approach the history of the project at CERN is presented
where CRISTAL was used to track data and process definitions and their
associated provenance data in the construction of the CMS ECAL detector, how it
was applied to handle analysis tracking and data index provenance in the
neuGRID and N4U projects, and how it will be matured further in the CRISTAL-ISE

the evolution, indexing and tracking of large datasets, and are keen to apply
it further in this direction.

obtained low-resolution optical spectra for 801 candidates. After removing
contaminants and poor quality spectra, the final sample comprised of 63
post-AGB/RGB candidates of A - F spectral type. Using the spectra, we estimated
the stellar parameters: effective temperature, surface gravity and [Fe/H]. We
also estimated the reddening and deduced the luminosity using the stellar
parameters combined with photometry. Based on a luminosity criterion, 42 of
these 63 sources were classified as post-RGB candidates and the remaining as
post-AGB candidates. From the spectral energy distributions we found that 6 of
the 63 post-AGB/RGB candidates have a circumstellar shell suggesting that they
are single stars, while 27 of them have a surrounding disc, suggesting that
they are binaries. For the remaining candidates the nature of the circumstellar
environment was unclear. Variability is displayed by 38 post-AGB/RGB candidates
with common variability types being the Population II Cepheids (including
RV-Tauri stars) and semi-regular variables. This study has also revealed a new
s-process enriched RV Tauri star (J005107.19-734133.3). From the numbers of
post-AGB/RGB stars in the SMC, we were able to estimate evolutionary rates that
are in good agreement with the stellar evolution models with mass loss in the
post-AGB phase and re-accretion in the post-RGB phase. This study also resulted
in a new sample of 40 luminous young stellar objects (YSOs) of A - F spectral

dominated by emission lines and in some cases, a UV continuum. These objects
are likely to be either hot post-AGB/RGBs or luminous YSOs.

processes in semiconductors an efficient model describing the scattering of
electrons by the ionized impurities is proposed. On the example of GaAs at 77
and 300 K and Si at 300 K the dependencies of low-field electron mobility on
the donor impurity concentration in the semiconductors are calculated in the
framework of proposed model as well as in the framework of such most frequently
used applied models as the Conwel-Weisskopf model and the Brooks-Herring one.
After comparing the calculation results with the well-known experimental data
it has been ascertained that the best agreement between the theory and
experiment is achieved with application of the proposed model.

the accuracy and effectiveness of SMARDDA, even in the presence of significant
nonaxisymmetric ripple field. SMARDDA's ability to exchange data with CAD
databases and its speed of execution also give it the potential for use
directly in the design of tokamak plasma facing components.

(SDNs) using a con- troller appliance to control the set of switches on the
network. The controlling process includes installing or uninstalling
packet-processing rules on flow tables of switches. This paper presents a
high-level imperative network programming language, called ImNet, to facilitate
writing efficient, yet simple, programs executed by controller to manage
switches. ImNet is simply-structured, expressive, compositional, and
imperative. This paper also introduces an operational semantics to ImNet.
Detailed examples of programs (with their operational semantics) constructed in
ImNet are illustrated in the paper as well.

create highly accurate learners for a never-ending stream of new tasks. The
challenge is to produce task-specific learners that can be trained from few
labeled samples, even if tasks are not uniquely identified, and the number of
tasks and input dimensionality are large. In this paper, we argue that the MLSP
should exploit knowledge from previous tasks to build a good representation of
the environment it is in, and more precisely, that useful representations for
such a service are ones that minimize generalization error for a new hypothesis
trained on a new task. We formalize this intuition with a novel method that
minimizes an empirical proxy of the intra-task small-sample generalization
error. We present several empirical results showing state-of-the art
performance on single-task transfer, multitask learning, and the full lifelong
learning problem.
