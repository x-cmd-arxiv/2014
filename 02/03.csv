their light curves. Most modern literature and catalogs of cataclysmic
variables quote the number of known Z Cams to be on the order of 30 or so
systems. After a four-year observing campaign and an exhaustive examination of
the data in the AAVSO International Database we have trimmed that number by a
third. One of the reasons for the misclassification of some systems is the fact
that the definition of what a Z Cam is has changed over the last 85 years to
what it is today. This has caused many stars formerly assumed to be Z Cams or
rumored to be Z Cams to be eliminated from the final list. In this paper we
present the results of our investigation into 65 stars listed at one time or
another in the literature as Z Cams or possible Z Cams.

obtain a family of matrix RHPs depending on the spectral parameter $\lambda$

studying the intersections of the locus of zeroes of a certain Theta function
with a straight line. This line can be calculated explicitly, and it depends on
the geometry of the intervals that define the FHT. The leading order
asymptotics of the singular functions and singular values are explicitly
expressed in terms of the Riemann Theta functions and of the period matrix of

  A conjecture on the index of length four sequences says that every minimal
zero-sum sequence of length 4 over a finite cyclic group $G$ with $\gcd(|G|,
6)=1$ has index 1. The conjecture was confirmed recently for the case when
$|G|$ is a product of at most two prime powers. However, the general case is
still open. In this paper, we make some progress towards solving the general
case. Based on earlier work on this problem, we show that if $G=\langle

$S=(x_1g)(x_2g)(x_3g)(x_4g)$ is a minimal zero-sum sequence over $G$ such that

  By using an innovative method developed in this paper, we are able to give a
new (and much shorter) proof to the index conjecture for the case when $|G|$ is

linear inverse correlation between $\xi$ and the spindown power $\dot E$, as
well as a near linear correlation between $\xi$ and pulsar age $\tau$. This is
a consequence of very weak, if any, dependences of radio luminosity $L$ on
pulsar period $P$ and period derivative $\dot{P}$, in contrast to X-ray or
$\gamma$-ray emission luminosities. The analysis of radio fluxes suggests that
these correlations are not due to a selection effect, but are intrinsic to the
pulsar radio emission physics. We have found that, although with a large
variance, the radio luminosity of pulsars is $\left<L\right>\approx 10^{29}
\,{\rm erg/s}$, regardless of the position in the $P-\dot P$ diagram. Within
such a picture, a model-independent statement can be made that the death line
of radio pulsars corresponds to an upper limit in the efficiency of radio
emission. If we introduce the maximum value for a radio efficiency into Monte
Carlo-based population syntheses we can reproduce the observed sample using the
random luminosity model. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on a synthetic flux
distribution shows high probability of reproducing the observed distribution.
Our results suggests that the plasma responsible for generating radio emission
is produced under similar conditions regardless of pulsar age, dipolar magnetic
field strength, and spin-down rate. The magnetic fields near the pulsar surface
are likely dominated by crust-anchored magnetic anomalies, which do not
significantly differ among pulsars, leading to similar conditions for
generating electron-positron pairs necessary to power radio emission.

ultra-relativistic baryonic shell that has high optical depth when the photons
are manufactured. Such a shell would not fully block photons reflected or
emitted from its inner surface, because the radial velocity of the photons can
be less than that of the shell. This avoids the standard problem associated
with GRBs that the thermal component should be produced where the flow is still
obscured by high optical depth. The radiation that escapes high optical depth
obeys the Amati relation. Observational implications may include a) anomalously
high ratios of afterglow to prompt emission, such as may have been the case in
the recently discovered PTF 11agg, and b) ultrahigh-energy neutrino pulses that
are non-coincident with detectable GRB. It is suggested that GRB 090510, a
short, very hard GRB with very little afterglow, was an {\it exposed} GRB, in

characterization of the corresponding invariant measure in distributed Kalman
filtering for potentially unstable and large linear dynamic systems. A gossip
network protocol termed Modified Gossip Interactive Kalman Filtering (M-GIKF)
is proposed, where sensors exchange their filtered states (estimates and error
covariances) and propagate their observations via inter-sensor communications
of rate $\overline{\gamma}$; $\overline{\gamma}$ is defined as the averaged
number of inter-sensor message passages per signal evolution epoch. The
filtered states are interpreted as stochastic particles swapped through local
interaction. The paper shows that the conditional estimation error covariance
sequence at each sensor under M-GIKF evolves as a random Riccati equation (RRE)
with Markov modulated switching. By formulating the RRE as a random dynamical
system, it is shown that the network achieves weak consensus, i.e., the
conditional estimation error covariance at a randomly selected sensor converges
weakly (in distribution) to a unique invariant measure. Further, it is proved
that as $\overline{\gamma} \rightarrow \infty$ this invariant measure satisfies
the Large Deviation (LD) upper and lower bounds, implying that this measure
converges exponentially fast (in probability) to the Dirac measure
$\delta_{P^*}$, where $P^*$ is the stable error covariance of the centralized
(Kalman) filtering setup. The LD results answer a fundamental question on how
to quantify the rate at which the distributed scheme approaches the centralized
performance as the inter-sensor communication rate increases.

`microvariations' on timescales of tens of days, to `outbursts' accompanied by
mass loss of up to 10e-03 solar masses per year, occurring decades apart, to
`giant eruptions' such as seen in Eta Carinae ejecting one or more solar masses
and recurring on timescales of centuries. Here we review the work of the Los
Alamos group since 1993 to investigate pulsations and instabilities in massive
stars using linear pulsation models and non-linear hydrodynamic models. The
models predict pulsational variability that may be associated with the
microvariations. Using a nonlinear pulsation hydrodynamics code with a
time-dependent convection treatment, we show that, in some circumstances, the
Eddington limit is exceeded periodically in the pulsation driving region of the
stellar envelope, accelerating the outer layers, and perhaps initiating mass
loss or LBV outbursts. We discuss how pulsations and mass loss may be
responsible for the location of the Humphreys-Davidson Limit in the H-R

the stellar core to cause such large amounts of mass to be ejected. We review
and suggest some possible explanations, including mixing from gravity modes,
secular instabilities, the epsilon mechanism, or the SASI instability as
proposed for Type II supernovae. We outline future work and required stellar

the analysis of the peridynamics model of nonlocal mechanics and nonlocal

setting for the nonlocal vector calculus that is independent of particular
nonlocal models. It is shown that general nonlocal calculus operators are
integral operators with specific integral kernels. General nonlocal calculus
properties are developed, including nonlocal integration by parts formula and
Green's identities. The nonlocal vector calculus introduced in [2] is shown to
be recoverable from the general formulation as a special example. This special
nonlocal vector calculus is used to reformulate the peridynamics equation of

example of nonlocal vector calculus operators is introduced, which shows the
potential use of the general formulation for general nonlocal models.

graph matching on multi-partite graphs, which arise in integrating multiple
data sources. Entity resolution-the data integration problem of performing
noisy joins on structured data-typically proceeds by first hashing each record
into zero or more blocks, scoring pairs of records that are co-blocked for
similarity, and then matching pairs of sufficient similarity. In the most
common case of matching two sources, it is often desirable for the final
matching to be one-to-one (a record may be matched with at most one other);
members of the database and statistical record linkage communities accomplish
such matchings in the final stage by weighted bipartite graph matching on
similarity scores. Such matchings are intuitively appealing: they leverage a
natural global property of many real-world entity stores-that of being nearly
deduped-and are known to provide significant improvements to precision and
recall. Unfortunately unlike the bipartite case, exact max-weight matching on
multi-partite graphs is known to be NP-hard. Our two-fold algorithmic
contributions approximate multi-partite max-weight matching: our first
algorithm borrows optimization techniques common to Bayesian probabilistic
inference; our second is a greedy approximation algorithm. In addition to a
theoretical guarantee on the latter, we present comparisons on a real-world ER
problem from Bing significantly larger than typically found in the literature,
publication data, and on a series of synthetic problems. Our results quantify
significant improvements due to exploiting multiple sources, which are made
possible by global one-to-one constraints linking otherwise independent
matching sub-problems. We also discover that our algorithms are complementary:
one being much more robust under noise, and the other being simple to implement
and very fast to run.

towards immediate band extrema with opposite momentum. These effects imply that

a hard spectrum at GeV energies as observed by the Large Area Telescope (LAT)
on board the {{\it Fermi}} satellite. This source is identified as a good
source candidate for very-high-energy (VHE; $> 30$ GeV) gamma rays. In general
VHE gamma rays from distant sources provide an unique opportunity to study the
extragalactic background light (EBL) and underlying astrophysics. The flux
intensity of this source in the VHE range is investigated. Then, constraints on
the EBL are derived from the attenuation of gamma-ray photons coming from the
distant blazar. We searched for a gamma-ray signal from this object using the
35-hour observations taken by the MAGIC telescopes between November 2010 and
January 2011. No significant VHE gamma-ray signal was detected. We computed the
upper limits of the integrated gamma-ray flux at $95\%$ confidence level of
$9.4 \times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and $2.5 \times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ above $100$ GeV and $200$ GeV, respectively. The differential upper
limits in four energy bins in the range from $80$ GeV to $500$ GeV are also
derived. The upper limits are consistent with the attenuation predicted by
low-flux EBL models on the assumption of a simple power-law spectrum
extrapolated from LAT data.

de- velopment projects can open business and engineering perspectives and help
to reduce risks and problems inherent in distributed development. Relying only
on a single evaluation criterion such as development cost when distributing
tasks to development sites has shown to be very risky and often does not lead
to successful solutions in the long run. Task allocation in global software
projects is challenging due to a multitude of impact factors and constraints.
Systematic allocation decisions require the ability to evaluate and compare
task allocation alternatives and to effectively establish customized task
allocation practices in an organization. In this article, we present a
customizable process for task allocation evaluation that is based on results
from a systematic interview study with practitioners. In this process, the
relevant criteria for evaluating task allocation alternatives are derived by
applying principles from goal-oriented measurement. In addition, the
customization of the process is demonstrated, related work and limitations are
sketched, and an outlook on future work is given.

MIMO interference channels with limited channel state information (CSI)
feedback based on quantization codebooks. Due to limited feedback and hence
imperfect IA, there are residual interferences across different links and
different data streams. As a result, the performance of IA is greatly related
to the CSI accuracy (namely number of feedback bits) and the number of data
streams (namely transmission mode). In order to improve the performance of IA,
it makes sense to optimize the system parameters according to the channel
conditions. Motivated by this, we first give a quantitative performance
analysis for IA under limited feedback, and derive a closed-form expression for
the average transmission rate in terms of feedback bits and transmission mode.
By maximizing the average transmission rate, we obtain an adaptive feedback
allocation scheme, as well as a dynamic mode selection scheme. Furthermore,
through asymptotic analysis, we obtain several clear insights on the system
performance, and provide some guidelines on the system design. Finally,
simulation results validate our theoretical claims, and show that obvious
performance gain can be obtained by adjusting feedback bits dynamically or
selecting transmission mode adaptively.

needed for an understanding of electroweak interactions of hadrons. Since
nuclear targets are being used many-body effects may affect the extracted cross

extraction of neutrino oscillation properties. We investigate the influence of
nuclear effects on neutrino interaction cross sections and make predictions for
charged current quasielastic (QE) scattering, nucleon-knock-out and pion- and
kaon-production on a CH target. The Giessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck
(GiBUU) model is used for the description of neutrino-nucleus reactions.
Integrated and differential cross sections for inclusive neutrino scattering,
QE processes and particle production for the MINER$\nu$A neutrino flux are
calculated. The influence of final state interactions on the identification of
these processes is discussed. In particular, energy and $Q^2$ reconstruction
for the MINER$\nu$A flux are critically examined. The $Q^2$ dependence of the
inclusive cross sections is found to be sensitive to the energy reconstruction.
Cut-offs in flux distributions have a large effect. Final state interactions
affect the pion kinetic energy spectra significantly and increase the kaon
cross sections by cross feeding from other channels.

free field such that an additional constraint holds: the sign of the free field
is constant on each cluster of loops. As a consequence of our coupling we
deduce that the loop clusters of parameter one-half do not percolate on
periodic lattices. We also construct a coupling between the random
interlacement on $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, $d\geq 3$, introduced by Sznitman, and the
Gaussian free field on the lattice such that the set of vertices visited by the
interlacement is contained in a level set of the free field. We deduce an
inequality between the critical level for the percolation by level sets of the
free field and the critical parameter for the percolation of the vacant set of
the random interlacement. Both in the case of loops and of the random
interlacement, the couplings are constructed by replacing discrete graphs by
metric graphs. Le Jan's and Sznitman's isomorphism theorems between the

states of 8Be in terms of the tensor-optimized shell model (TOSM). In TOSM, the
tensor correlation is optimized in the full space of 2p2h configurations
involving high-momentum components. The short-range correlation is treated with
the unitary correlation operator method (UCOM). We use the effective
interaction based on the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction AV8$^\prime$. The 8Be
states consist of two groups of ground band states and highly excited states
with the isospin T=0 and T=1. It is found that the tensor contributions of the
ground band states are stronger than the highly excited states and that the
kinetic energies and the central contributions of the ground band states are
almost twice the 4He values. These features suggest two-alpha clustering for
the ground band states in 8Be. We also estimate the correlation energy of the
$\alpha$ clustering using the alpha cluster model. In the highly excited
states, the calculated spectrum in TOSM reproduces the experimental level order
and the relative energies of each level. This agreement suggests that those
states can be interpreted as shell-like states. The level order is found to be
sensitive to the presence of the tensor force in comparison with the results
using the Minnesota effective interaction without the tensor force. It is also
found that the tensor contributions in the T=0 states are stronger than the T=1
states, which is consistent with the state dependence of the tensor force.

mean-field dynamics of the condensate. Due to the asymmetry in the scattering
lengths, the two components exhibit density oscillations where they spatially
separate and recombine. The effective non-linearity responsible for spin
squeezing is increased by up to three orders of magnitude when the two
components spatially separate \cite{treutlein2010}. We perform a multi-mode
simulation of the system using the truncated Wigner method, and show that this
method can be used to create significant spin squeezing in systems where the
effective nonlinearity would ordinarily be too small, and that strong spatial
dynamics resulting from large particle numbers aren't necessarily detrimental
to generating spin-squeezing. We develop a simplified semi-analytic model that
gives good agreement with our multi-mode simulation, and will be useful for
predicting spin-squeezing in a range of different systems.

identified several potential parent bodies for this meteoroid, the analysis of

Polymers mediate attractions between colloids, leading to phase separation and
crystallisation. We find that the dynamical interplay between sedimentation,
phase separation and crystal nucleation underlie this phenomenon. Furthermore,
under certain conditions we find a kinetic pathway leading to an apparent
coexistence between a one component crystal and binary fluid of equal buoyancy.

cluster and isolated objects. Using a recent compilation of HI and CO data we
study the effects of the cluster on the molecular gas content of spiral
galaxies. We first identify M* as the scaling variable that traces the total H2
mass of galaxies better. We show that, on average, HI-deficient galaxies are
significantly offset from the M(H2) vs. M* relation for HI-normal galaxies. We
use the M(H2) vs. M* scaling relation to define the H2-deficiency parameter.
This parameter shows a weak and scattered relation with the HI-def, here taken
as a proxy for galaxy interactions with the cluster environment. We also show
that, as for the HI, the extent of the H2 disc decreases with increasing
HI-deficiency. These results show that cluster galaxies have, on average, a
lower H2 content than similar objects in the field. The slope of the H2-def vs.
HI-def relation is less than 1, while the D(HI)/D(i) vs. HI-def relation is
steeper than the D(CO)/D(i) vs. HI-def relation, thereby indicating that the H2
gas is removed less efficiently than the HI. This result can be understood if
the HI is distributed on a flat disc more extended than the stellar disc, thus
less anchored to the gravitational potential well of the galaxy than the H2.
There is a clear trend between the NUV-i colour and H2-def, which suggests that
H2 removal quenches the activity of star formation. This causes galaxies
migrate from the blue cloud to the green valley and, eventually, to the red
sequence. The total gas-consumption timescale of gas deficient cluster galaxies
is comparable to that of isolated systems, and is significantly larger than the
typical timescale for total gas removal in a ram pressure stripping process,
thus suggesting that ram pressure, rather than starvation, is the dominant
process driving the evolution of these cluster galaxies.

field direction at tube walls. We have also found some evidence that the flux
tube walls can be associated with local heating of the plasma and elevated
proton and electron temperatures. For the tubes aligned with the Parker spiral,
the twist angle can be estimated from the change of magnetic field direction.
Stability analysis of twisted tubes shows that the critical twist angle of the
tube with a homogeneous twist is 70$^0$, but the angle can further decrease
owing to the motion of the tube with regards to the solar wind stream. The
tubes with a stronger twist are unstable to the kink instability, therefore

  2013","10.1016/j.pepi.2013.01.001",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mars Global Surveyor measurements revealed that the Martian crust is strongly
magnetized in the southern hemisphere while the northern hemisphere is
virtually void of magnetization. Two possible reasons have been suggested for
this dichotomy: A once more or less homogeneously magnetization may have been
destroyed in the northern hemisphere by, for example, resurfacing or impacts.
The alternative theory we further explore here assumes that the dynamo itself
produced a hemispherical field. We use numerical dynamo simulations to study
under which conditions a spatial variation of the heat flux through the
core-mantle boundary (CMB) may yield a strongly hemispherical surface field. We
assume that the early Martian dynamo was exclusively driven by secular cooling
and we mostly concentrate on a cosine CMB heat flux pattern with a minimum at
the north pole, possibly caused by the impacts responsible for the northern
lowlands. This pattern consistently triggers a convective mode which is
dominated by equatorially anti-symmetric and axisymmetric (EAA) thermal winds.
Convective up- and down-wellings and thus radial magnetic field production then
tend to concentrate in the southern hemisphere which is still cooled
efficiently while the northern hemisphere remains hot. The dynamo changes from
an alpha^2- for a homogeneous CMB heat flux to an alpha-Omega-type in the
hemispherical configuration. These dynamos reverse on time scales of about 10
kyrs. This too fast to allow for the more or less unidirectional magnetization
of thick crustal layer required to explain the strong magnetization in the
southern hemisphere.

with a time-dependent 2D MHD loop model, including the description of the
expanding magnetic field, coronal heating and losses by thermal conduction and
radiation from optically thin plasma. We run a simulation for a loop 50 Mm long
and quasi-statically heated to about 4 MK. We find that the area can change
substantially with the quasi-steady heating rate, e.g. by ~40% at 0.5 MK as the

axisymmetric azimuthal magnetic field. This is a prerequisite for Parker dynamo
waves that may be responsible for the solar cycle. In the liquid iron cores of
terrestrial planets, the Coriolis force organizes convection into columns with
a strong helical flow component. These likely dominate magnetic field
generation while the $\Omega$-effect is of secondary importance. Here we use
numerical simulations to show that the planetary dynamo scenario may change
when the heat flux through the outer boundary is higher in one hemisphere than
in the other. A hemispherical dynamo is promoted that is dominated by fierce
thermal wind responsible for a strong $\Omega$-effect. As a consequence Parker
dynamo waves are excited equivalent to those predicted for the Sun. They obey

and drawbacks of each procedure are outlined as well as the advantages of the
Bayesian approach versus classical procedures. The paper makes emphasis on
recent Bayesian non-parametric approaches for GARCH models that avoid imposing
arbitrary parametric distributional assumptions. These novel approaches
implicitly assume infinite mixture of Gaussian distributions on the
standardized returns which have been shown to be more flexible and describe
better the uncertainty about future volatilities. Finally, the survey presents
an illustration using real data to show the flexibility and usefulness of the
non-parametric approach.

because this phrase can refer to two different theorems that John Bell proved,
the first in 1964 and the second in 1976. His 1964 theorem is the
incompatibility of quantum phenomena with the dual assumptions of locality and
determinism. His 1976 theorem is the incompatibility of quantum phenomena with
the unitary property of local causality. This is contrary to Bell's own later
assertions, that his 1964 theorem began with that single, and indivisible,
assumption of local causality (even if not by that name). While there are other
forms of Bell's theorems --- which I present to explain the relation between
Jarrett-completeness, ""fragile locality"", and EPR-completeness --- I maintain
that Bell's two versions are the essential ones. Although the two Bell's
theorems are logically equivalent, their assumptions are not, and the different
versions of the theorem suggest quite different conclusions, which are embraced
by different communities. For realists, the notion of local causality, ruled
out by Bell's 1976 theorem, is motivated implicitly by Reichenbach's Principle
of common cause and explicitly by the Principle of relativistic causality, and
it is the latter which must be forgone. Operationalists pay no heed to
Reichenbach's Principle, but wish to keep the Principle of relativistic
causality, which, bolstered by an implicit ""Principle of agent-causation"",
implies their notion of locality. Thus for operationalists, Bell's theorem is
the 1964 one, and implies that it is determinism that must be forgone. I
discuss why the two `camps' are drawn to these different conclusions, and what
can be done to increase mutual understanding.

plug-in, excess mass, or a hybrid approach. The plug-in methods are based on
replacing the unknown density by some nonparametric estimator, usually the
kernel. Thus, the bandwidth selection is a fundamental problem from a practical
point of view. Recently, specific selectors for level sets have been proposed.
However, if some a priori information about the geometry of the level set is
available, then excess mass algorithms can be useful. In this case, a density
estimator is not necessary, and the problem of bandwidth selection can be
avoided. The third methodology is a hybrid of the others. As in the excess mass
method, it assumes a mild geometric restriction on the level set and, like the
plug-in approach, requires a pilot nonparametric estimator of the density. One
interesting open question concerns the practical performance of these methods.
In this work, existing methods are reviewed, and two new hybrid algorithms are
proposed. Their practical behaviour is compared through extensive simulations.

modulation of the same magnitude in the opposite direction. Our analysis takes
into account the gaming possibilities of producers and retailers, controlling
load flexibility, in the day-ahead energy and reserve markets, and in imbalance
settlement. This analysis is carried out by an agent-based approach where, for
every round, each actor uses linear programs to maximize its profit according
to forecasts of the prices. The procurement of a reserve is assumed to be
determined, for each period, as a fixed percentage of the total consumption
cleared in the energy market for the same period. The results show that the
provision of reserves by flexible loads has a negligible impact on the energy
market prices but markedly decreases the cost of reserve procurement. However,
as the rate of flexible loads increases, the system operator has to rely more
and more on non-contracted reserves, which may cancel out the benefits made in
the procurement of reserves.

The circular geometry creates frustration in the nematic phase and a

observed with a (minimal) director distortion which is relaxed via the
formation of orientational domain walls. This novel structure is not predicted

Reynolds numbers, particle sizes, and channel aspect ratios. Our findings
thereby help to design microfluidic channels for particle sorting. Furthermore,
we demonstrate how an axial control force, which slows down the particles,
shifts the stable equilibrium position towards the channel center. Ultimately,
the particles then stay on the centerline for forces exceeding a threshold
value. This effect is sensitive to particle size and channel Reynolds number
and therefore suggests an efficient method for particle separation. In
combination with a hysteretic feedback scheme, we can even increase particle
throughput.

for scaling processes in general is influenced by large-scale energetic
structures, known as infrared effect. Therefore, the extracted scaling
exponents $\zeta(n)$ might be biased due to this effect. In this paper, a
detrended structure-function (DSF) method is proposed to extract scaling
exponents by constraining the influence of large-scale structures. This is
accomplished by removing a $1$st-order polynomial fitting within a window size
$\ell$ before calculating the velocity increment. By doing so, the scales
larger than $\ell$, i.e., $r\ge \ell$, are expected to be removed or
constrained. The detrending process is equivalent to be a high-pass filter in
physical domain. Meanwhile the intermittency nature is retained. We first
validate the DSF method by using a synthesized fractional Brownian motion for
mono-fractal processes and a lognormal process for multifractal random walk
processes. The numerical results show comparable scaling exponents $\zeta(n)$
and singularity spectra $D(h)$ for the original SFs and DSFs. When applying the
DSF to a turbulent velocity obtained from a high Reynolds number wind tunnel
experiment with $Re_{\lambda}\simeq 720$, the 3rd-order DSF demonstrates a
clear inertial range with $\mathcal{B}_3(\ell)\simeq 4/5\epsilon \ell$ on the
range $10<\ell/\eta<1000$, corresponding to a wavenumber range
$0.001<k\eta<0.1$. This inertial range is consistent with the one predicted by
the Fourier power spectrum. The directly measured scaling exponents $\zeta(n)$
(resp. singularity spectrum $D(h)$) agree very well with a lognormal model with
an intermittent parameter $\mu=0.33$. Due to large-scale effects, the results
provided by the SFs are biased.

LMXB SAX J1808.4-3658 showed in the past a neon column density significantly
higher than expected given its small distance, presumably due to additional
absorption from a neon-rich circumstellar medium (CSM). It is possible to
detect intrinsic absorption from the CSM by evidence of Keplerian motions or
outflows. For this purpose, we use a recent, deep (100 ks long),
high-resolution Chandra/LETGS spectrum of SAX J1808.4-3658 in combination with
archival data. We estimated the column densities of the different absorbers
through the study of their absorption lines. We used both empirical and
physical models involving photo- and collisional-ionization in order to
determine the nature of the absorbers. The abundances of the cold interstellar
gas match the solar values as expected given the proximity of the X-ray source.
For the first time in this source, we detected neon and oxygen blueshifted
absorption lines that can be well modeled with outflowing photoionized gas. The
wind is neon rich (Ne/O>3) and may originate from processed, ionized gas near
the accretion disk or its corona. The kinematics (v=500-1000 km/s) are indeed
similar to those seen in other accretion disks. We also discovered a system of
emission lines with very high Doppler velocities (v~24000 km/s) originating
presumably closer to the compact object. Additional observations and UV
coverage are needed to accurately determine the wind abundances and its
ionization structure.

made possible a first population study. Evidence was found for a correlation
between gamma-ray luminosity and tracers of the star formation activity.
Studying galactic cosmic rays (CRs) in various global conditions can yield
information about their origin and transport in the interstellar medium (ISM).
This work addresses the question of the scaling laws that can be expected for
the interstellar gamma-ray emission as a function of global galactic
properties, with the goal of establishing whether the current experimental data
in the GeV range can be constraining. I developed a 2D model for the
non-thermal emissions from steady-state CR populations interacting with the ISM
in star-forming galaxies. Most CR-related parameters were taken from Milky Way
studies, and a large number of galaxies were then simulated with sizes from 4
to 40kpc, several gas distributions, and star formation rates (SFR) covering
six orders of magnitude. The evolution of the gamma-ray luminosity over the
100keV-100TeV range is presented, with emphasis on the contribution of the
different emission processes and particle populations, and on the transition
between transport regimes. The model can reproduce the normalisation and trend
inferred from the Fermi/LAT population study over most of the SFR range. This
is obtained with a plain diffusion scheme, a single diffusion coefficient, and
the assumption that CRs experience large-scale volume-averaged interstellar
conditions. There is, however, no universal relation between high-energy
gamma-ray luminosity and star formation activity, as illustrated by the scatter
introduced by different galactic global properties and the downturn in
gamma-ray emission at the low end (abridged).

While powerful algorithms are available to facilitate the sampling of the
conformational space, successful applications of such models are hindered by
the availability of simple enough potentials able to satisfactorily reproduce
known properties of the system. We develop an interatomic potential to account
for a number of properties of proteins in a computationally economic way. The
potential is defined within an all-atom, implicit solvent model by contact
functions between the different atom types. The associated numerical values can
be optimised by an iterative Monte Carlo scheme on any available experimental
data, provided that they are expressible as thermal averages of some
conformational properties. We test this model on three different proteins, for
which we also perform a scan of all possible point mutations with explicit
conformational sampling. The resulting models, optimised solely on a subset of
native distances, not only reproduce the native conformations within a few
Angstroms from the experimental ones, but show the cooperative transition
between native and denatured state and correctly predict the measured
free--energy changes associated with point mutations. Moreover, differently
from other structure-based models, our method leaves a residual degree of
frustration, which is known to be present in protein molecules.

non-perturbative contribution to the quark mass is generated as a consequence
of the dynamical phenomenon of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, in turn
triggered by the explicitly breaking of chiral symmetry induced by the critical
Wilson term in the action. In pure lattice QCD this mass term cannot be
separated from the unavoidably associated linearly divergent contribution.
However, if QCD is enlarged to a theory where also a scalar field is present,
coupled to an SU(2) doublet of fermions via a Yukawa and a Wilson-like term,
then in the phase where the scalar field takes a non-vanishing expectation
value, a dynamically generated and ""naturally"" light fermion mass (numerically
unrelated to the expectation value of the scalar field) is conjectured to
emerge at a critical value of the Yukawa coupling where the symmetry of the
model is maximally enhanced. Masses dynamically generated in this way display a
natural hierarchy according to which the stronger is the strongest of the
interactions the fermion is subjected to the larger is its mass.

  Trento, Italy",,,,"hep-ph hep-lat hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We describe the phenomenon of dynamical gluon mass generation within the
massless bound-state formalism, which constitutes the general framework for the
systematic implementation of the Schwinger mechanism in non-Abelian gauge
theories. The main ingredient of this formalism is the dynamical formation of
bound states with vanishing mass, which gives rise to effective vertices
containing massless poles; these vertices, in turn, trigger the Schwinger
mechanism, and allow for the gauge-invariant generation of an effective gluon
mass. In this particular approach, the gluon mass is directly related to
quantities that are intrinsic to the bound-state formation itself, such as the
""transition amplitude"" and the corresponding ""bound-state wave-function"".
Specifically, a set of powerful relations discussed in the text, allows one to
determine the dynamical evolution of the gluon mass through a Bethe-Salpeter
equation, which controls the dynamics of the relevant wave-function. In
addition, it is possible to demonstrate that the massless bound-state formalism
is equivalent to the standard approach based on Schwinger-Dyson equations, thus
establishing a formal connection between two different nonperturbative
formalisms.

observed chemical complexity in disks has been limited due to freeze out of
molecules onto grains in the bulk of the cold outer disk. Complex molecules can
be studied more directly in transitional disks with large inner holes, as these
have a higher potential of detection, through UV heating of the outer disk and
the directly exposed midplane at the wall. We use Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 9 (~680 GHz) line data of the
transitional disk Oph IRS 48, previously shown to have a large dust trap, to
search for complex molecules in regions where planetesimals are forming. We
report the detection of the H2CO 9(1,8)-8(1,7) line at 674 GHz, which is
spatially resolved as a semi-ring at ~60 AU radius centered south from the
star. The inferred H2CO abundance is ~10^{-8} derived by combining a physical
disk model of the source with a non-LTE excitation calculation. Upper limits
for CH3OH lines in the same disk give an abundance ratio H2CO/CH3OH>0.3, which
points to both ice formation and gas-phase routes playing a role in the H2CO
production. Upper limits on the abundances of H13CO+, CN and several other
molecules in the disk are also derived and found to be consistent with full
chemical models. The detection of the H2CO line demonstrates the start of
complex organic molecules in a planet-forming disk. Future ALMA observations
should be able to push down the abundance detection limits of other molecules
by 1-2 orders of magnitude and test chemical models of organic molecules in

covered region is maximized, solving the Maximum Area Triangulation Problem
(MATP). The resulting triangulation is a physical data structure that is a
compact representation of the workspace; it contains distributed knowledge of
each triangle, adjacent triangles, and the dual graph of the workspace.
Algorithms can store information in this physical data structure, such as a
routing table for robot navigation Our algorithm builds a triangulation in a
closed environment, starting from a single location. It provides coverage with
a breadth-first search pattern and completeness guarantees. We show the
computational and communication requirements to build and maintain the
triangulation and its dual graph are small. Finally, we present a physical
navigation algorithm that uses the dual graph, and show that the resulting path
lengths are within a constant factor of the shortest-path Euclidean distance.
We validate our theoretical results with experiments on triangulating a region
with a system of low-cost robots. Analysis of the resulting quality of the
triangulation shows that most of the triangles are of high quality, and cover a
large area. Implementation of the triangulation, dual graph, and navigation all
use communication messages of fixed size, and are a practical solution for
large populations of low-cost robots.

gravity implies a radius of 0.091+/-0.005 Rsun; combined further with the

algebras defined for every ordinal $\alpha$. The former are cylindric algebras
of dimension $\alpha$ expanded with $\sf S4$ modalities indexed by $\alpha$.
The semantics of representable topological algebras is induced by the interior
operation relative to a topology defined on their bases. Tense cylindric
algebras are cylindric algebras expanded by the modalities $F$(future) and $P$
(past) algebraising predicate temporal logic.
  We show for both tense and topological cylindric algebras of finite dimension
$n>2$ that infinitely many varieties containing and including the variety of
representable algebras of dimension $n$ are not atom canonical. We show that
any class containing the class of completely representable algebras having a
weak neat embedding property is not elementary. From these two results we draw
the same conclusion on omitting types for finite variable fragments of
predicate topologic and temporal logic. We show that the usual version of the
omitting types theorem restricted to such fragments when the number of
variables is $>2$ fails dramatically even if we considerably broaden the class
of models permitted to omit a single non principal type in countable atomic
theories, namely, the non-principal type consting of co atoms.

for nonrelativistic and relativistic cases. Proposed definition allows using
wide classes of reference frames without restriction to inertial, uniformly
accelerated or rotating frames. A conception of the system of coordinates
associated with a reference frame is introduced. It is shown that one of these
coordinates can be regarded as temporal coordinate, and the others as spatial
ones. It is demonstrated that in relativistic case nondiagonal spatial-temporal
components of the metric tensor are always equal to zero. Inertial,

Scales","Characterizing the Topography of Multi-dimensional Energy Landscapes","14 figures and an appendix containing proof of main result",,,,"cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A basic issue in optimization, inverse theory,neural networks, computational
chemistry and many other problems is the geometrical characterization of high
dimensional functions. In inverse calculations one aims to characterize the set
of models that fit the data (among other constraints). If the data misfit
function is unimodal then one can find its peak by local optimization methods
and characterize its width (related to the range of data-fitting models) by
estimating derivatives at this peak. On the other hand, if there are local
extrema, then a number of interesting and difficult problems arise. Are the
local extrema important compared to the global or can they be eliminated (e.g.,
by smoothing) without significant loss of information? Is there a sufficiently
small number of local extrema that they can be enumerated via local
optimization? What are the basins of attraction of these local extrema? Can two
extrema be joined by a path that never goes uphill? Can the whole problem be
reduced to one of enumerating the local extrema and their basins of attraction?
For locally ill-conditioned functions, premature convergence of local
optimization can be confused with the presence of local extrema. Addressing any
of these issues requires topographic information about the functions under
study. But in many applications these functions may have hundreds or thousands
of variables and can only be evaluated pointwise (by some numerical method for
instance). In this paper we describe systematic (but generic) methods of
analysing the topography of high dimensional functions using local optimization
methods applied to randomly chosen starting models. We provide a number of
quantitative measures of function topography that have proven to be useful in
practical problems along with error estimates.
