the Web is the Markov chain model, where Web pages are represented as states
and hyperlinks as probabilities of navigating from one page to another.
Predominantly, human navigation on the Web has been thought to satisfy the
memoryless Markov property stating that the next page a user visits only
depends on her current page and not on previously visited ones. This idea has
found its way in numerous applications such as Google's PageRank algorithm and
others. Recently, new studies suggested that human navigation may better be
modeled using higher order Markov chain models, i.e., the next page depends on
a longer history of past clicks. Yet, this finding is preliminary and does not
account for the higher complexity of higher order Markov chain models which is
why the memoryless model is still widely used. In this work we thoroughly
present a diverse array of advanced inference methods for determining the
appropriate Markov chain order. We highlight strengths and weaknesses of each
method and apply them for investigating memory and structure of human
navigation on the Web. Our experiments reveal that the complexity of higher
order models grows faster than their utility, and thus we confirm that the
memoryless model represents a quite practical model for human navigation on a
page level. However, when we expand our analysis to a topical level, where we
abstract away from specific page transitions to transitions between topics, we
find that the memoryless assumption is violated and specific regularities can
be observed. We report results from experiments with two types of navigational
datasets (goal-oriented vs. free form) and observe interesting structural
differences that make a strong argument for more contextual studies of human
navigation in future work.

contributors collaborate, they also compete for status in the community and for
imposing their views on the product. In this paper we investigate collaborative
authoring in Wikipedia where contributors append and overwrite previous
contributions to a page. We assume that a contributors goal is to maximize
ownership of content sections such that content owned (or originated) by her
survived the most recent revision of the page. We model contributors
interactions to increase their content ownership as a noncooperative game where
a players utility is associated with content owned and cost is a function of
effort expended. Our results capture several real life aspects of contributors
interactions within peer production projects. We show that at the Nash
equilibrium there is an inverse relationship between the effort required to
make a contribution and the survival of a contributors content. In other words
majority of the content that survives is necessarily contributed by experts who
expend relatively less effort than non experts. An empirical analysis of
Wikipedia articles provides support for our models predictions. Implications
for research and practice are discussed in the context of trustworthy
collaboration as well as vandalism.

observed by CoRoT. Using simulations, we find that extracting frequencies down
to a given false alarm probability by means of successive prewhitening leads to
a gross over-estimate of the number of frequencies in a star. This is due to
blending of the peaks in the periodogram due to the finite duration of the time
series. Prewhitening is equivalent to adding a frequency to the data which is
carefully chosen to interfere destructively with a given frequency in the data.
Since the frequency extracted from a blended peak is not quite correct, the
interference is not destructive with the result that many additional fictitious
frequencies are added to the data. In data with very high signal-to-noise, such
as the CoRoT data, these spurious frequencies are highly significant.
Continuous prewhitening thus causes a cascade of spurious frequencies which
leads to a much larger estimate of the mode density than is actually the case.
The results reported for HD 50844 are consistent with this effect. Direct
comparison of the power in the raw periodogram in this star with that in delta
Scuti stars observed by Kepler shows that HD 50844 has a typical mode density.

  Servers",,,,,"cs.DC cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Energy consumption is a growing issue in data centers, impacting their
economic viability and their public image. In this work we empirically
characterize the power and energy consumed by different types of servers. In
particular, in order to understand the behavior of their energy and power
consumption, we perform measurements in different servers. In each of them, we
exhaustively measure the power consumed by the CPU, the disk, and the network
interface under different configurations, identifying the optimal operational
levels. One interesting conclusion of our study is that the curve that defines
the minimal CPU power as a function of the load is neither linear nor purely
convex as has been previously assumed. Moreover, we find that the efficiency of
the various server components can be maximized by tuning the CPU frequency and
the number of active cores as a function of the system and network load, while
the block size of I/O operations should be always maximized by applications. We
also show how to estimate the energy consumed by an application as a function
of some simple parameters, like the CPU load, and the disk and network
activity. We validate the proposed approach by accurately estimating the energy
of a map-reduce computation in a Hadoop platform.

modules on a hypersurface ring having only an isolated singularity. Up to a
sign, it agrees with the Euler invariant of a pair of matrix factorizations.
  Working over the complex numbers, Buchweitz and van Straten have established
an interesting connection between Hochster's theta invariant and the classical
linking form on the link of the singularity. In particular, they establish the
vanishing of the theta invariant if the hypersurface is even-dimensional by
exploiting the fact that the (reduced) cohomology of the Milnor fiber is
concentrated in odd degrees in this situation.
  In this paper, we give purely algebraic versions of some of these results. In
particular, we establish the vanishing of the theta invariant for isolated
hypersurface singularities of odd dimension in characteristic p > 0, under some
mild extra assumptions. This confirms, in a large number of cases, a conjecture
of Hailong Dao.

for Lorentz-invariant systems the effective Lagrangian method fails in one

expansion -- an accuracy never achieved by conventional condensed matter

at low temperatures by considering the pressure and the order parameter. The
two apparently very different systems (ferromagnets and QCD) are related from a
universal point of view based on the spontaneously broken symmetry. In either

distributions: one resulting from a measurement of $A$ followed by a
measurement of $B$ on a given state, and the other obtained from a measurement
of $B$ alone on the same state. We show that maximizing the distance between
these two distributions over all states yields a valid measure of the

commute and is strictly greater than zero (and less than or equal to one)
otherwise.
  For finite dimensional systems, we obtain a tight upper bound on the
incompatibility of any pair of observables and show that the bound is attained
when the observables are totally non-degenerate and associated with mutually

between the incompatibility of a pair of observables and the maximal
disturbances due to their measurements. Finally, we indicate how these measures

non-projective measurements. In particular, we obtain a non-trivial upper bound

Their accuracy have been tested extensively for Earth-like conditions, but
verification of the methods' applicability to hot Jupiter-like conditions is
lacking in the literature. We are adapting the UK Met Office GCM, the Unified

adaptation of the Edwards-Slingo radiation scheme based on the two-stream

absorption coefficients from high temperature line lists and highlight the
large uncertainty in the pressure-broadened line widths. We compare fluxes and
heating rates obtained with our adapted scheme to more accurate discrete
ordinate (DO) line-by-line (LbL) calculations ignoring scattering effects. We
find that, in most cases, errors stay below 10 % for both heating rates and
fluxes using ~ 10 k-coefficients in each band and a diffusivity factor D =
1.66. The two-stream approximation and the correlated-k method both contribute
non-negligibly to the total error. We also find that using band-averaged
absorption coefficients, which have previously been used in
radiative-hydrodynamical simulations of a hot Jupiter, may yield errors of ~
100 %, and should thus be used with caution.

nonlinear photoacoustic wavefront shaping (PAWS), which achieves optical
diffraction-limited (i.e. single-speckle-grain) focusing in scattering media.
We develop an efficient dual-pulse excitation approach to generate strong

These nonlinear PA signals are used as feedback to guide iterative wavefront
optimization. By maximizing the amplitude of the nonlinear PA signal, light is
effectively focused to a single optical speckle grain. Experimental results
demonstrate a clear optical focus on the scale of 5-7 micrometers, which is ~10
times smaller than the acoustic focus in linear dimension, with an enhancement
factor of ~6000 in peak fluence. This technology has the potential to provide

lead to hotter and more luminous stars, in particular during later evolutionary
phases. As a result, stellar populations containing massive stars are predicted
to become more luminous for a given mass and to emit more ionizing photons.
Depending on the assumed rotation velocity, rotation causes profound changes in
the properties of young stellar populations. These changes are most noticeable
at later evolutionary phases and at shorter wavelengths of the spectral energy
distribution. Most strikingly, the Lyman continuum luminosity increases by up
to a factor of five in O- and Wolf-Rayet stars. Care is required when comparing

between a few MeV up to around one third of the physical strange mass, while

ALMA observations resolve the dust-depleted disk cavities and extended gaseous
disks, revealing large-scale asymmetries in the dust emission of both disks. We
modeled these disks structures with a ring and an azimuthal gaussian, where the
azimuthal gaussian is motivated by the steady-state vortex solution from Lyra &
Lin (2013). Compared to recent observations of HD 142527, Oph IRS 48, and LkHa
330, these are low-contrast (< 2) asymmetries. Nevertheless, a ring alone is
not a good fit, and the addition of a vortex prescription describes these data
much better. The asymmetric component encompasses 15% and 28% of the total disk
emission in SAO 206462 and SR 21 respectively, which corresponds to a lower
limit of 2 MJup of material within the asymmetry for both disks. Although the
contrast in the dust asymmetry is low, we find that the turbulent velocity
inside it must be large (~20% of the sound speed) in order to drive these
azimuthally wide and radially narrow vortex-like structures. We obtain
residuals from the ring and vortex fitting that are still significant, tracing
non-axisymmetric emission in both disks. We compared these submillimeter
observations with recently published H-band scattered light observations. For

directly related in frequency and phase. The oscillations present in the fast
rotating Delta Scuti star KIC 8054146 allow us to test the most general and
generic aspects of such a theory. The only direct way to separate the parent
and coupled (child) modes is to examine the correlations in amplitude
variability between the different frequencies. For the dominant family of
related frequencies, only a single mode and a triplet are the origins of nine
dominant frequency peaks ranging from 2.93 to 66.30 cycles per day (as well as
dozens of small-amplitude combination modes and a predicted and detected third
high-frequency triplet). The mode-coupling model correctly predicts the large
amplitude variations of the coupled modes as a product of the amplitudes of the
parent modes, while the phase changes are also correctly modeled. This differs
from the behavior of 'normal' combination frequencies in that the amplitudes
are three orders of magnitude larger and may exceed even the amplitudes of the
parent modes. We show that two dominant low frequencies at 5.86 and 2.93 cycles
per day in the gravity-mode region are not harmonics of each other, and their
properties follow those of the almost equidistant high-frequency triplet. We
note that the previously puzzling situation of finding two strong peaks in the
low-frequency region related by nearly a factor of two in frequency has been
seen in other Delta Scuti stars as well.

are a number of physical, chemical and biological changes that take place.
Therefore it is logical to assume that the brain is no exception to this
phenomenon. The principle purpose of this project is to use models of neural
dynamics and learning based on the underlying principle of self-organised
criticality, to account for the age related cognitive effects. In this regard
learning in neural networks can serve as a model for the acquisition of skills
and knowledge in early development stages i.e. the ageing process and
criticality in the network serves as the optimum state of cognitive abilities.
Possible candidate mechanisms for ageing in a neural network are loss of
connectivity and neurons, increase in the level of noise, reduction in white
matter or more interestingly longer learning history and the competition among
several optimization objectives. In this paper we are primarily interested in
the affect of the longer learning history on memory and thus the optimality in
the brain. Hence it is hypothesized that prolonged learning in the form of
associative memory patterns can destroy the state of criticality in the
network. We base our model on Tsodyks and Markrams [49] model of dynamic
synapses, in the process to explore the effect of combining standard Hebbian
learning with the phenomenon of Self-organised criticality. The project mainly
consists of evaluations and simulations of networks of integrate and
fire-neurons that have been subjected to various combinations of neural-level
ageing effects, with the aim of establishing the primary hypothesis and
understanding the decline of cognitive abilities due to ageing, using one of
its important characteristics, a longer learning history.

Chromodynamics shows an interesting phase structure due to an exact center, or

In previous studies of this region with staggered fermions it was found that
the RW endpoint, where the center transition changes from first-order to a
crossover, depends non-trivially on the quark mass: for high and low masses, it
is a triple point connecting to the deconfinement and chiral transitions,
respectively, changing to a second-order endpoint for intermediate mass values.
These parameter regions are separated by tricritical points. Here we present a
confirmation of these findings using Wilson fermions on $N_\tau=4$ lattices. In

measurement of the planet's true mass as well as its atmospheric properties.
After removing telluric absorption and cross-correlating with a model planetary
spectrum dominated by water opacity, we measure a 6-sigma detection of the
planet at K_p = 111 +- 5 km/s, with a 1-sigma upper limit on the spectroscopic
flux ratio of 10^-4. This radial velocity leads to a planetary orbital
inclination of i = 45+3-4degrees and a mass of M_P = 5.90+0.35-0.20 M_ Jup. We
report the first detection of water vapor in the atmosphere of a non-transiting
hot Jupiter, tau Boo b.

examine the DNA.
  RADIA was developed for the identification of somatic mutations using both
DNA and RNA from the same individual. We demonstrate high sensitivity (84%) and
very high specificity (98% and 99%) in real data from endometrial carcinoma and
lung adenocarcinoma from TCGA. Mutations with both high DNA and RNA read
support have the highest validation rate of over 99%. We also introduce a
simulation package that spikes in artificial mutations to real data, rather
than simulating sequencing data from a reference genome. We evaluate
sensitivity on the simulation data and demonstrate our ability to rescue back
calls at low DNA allelic frequencies by including the RNA. Finally, we
highlight mutations in important cancer genes that were rescued back due to the

assumed to come entirely from winds flowing from just behind the jet shocks.
Combining analytic and computational methods, it is shown that the computed
radio-electron energy distribution and synchrotron emissivity spectra
everywhere in the Cygnus A radio cavity agrees with radio observations of the
Cygnus A lobes. The magnetic field energy density is small everywhere and
evolves passively in the post-shock wind. Most synchrotron emission arises in
recent post-shock material as it flows back along the radio cavity wall.
Because it experienced less adiabatic expansion, the magnetic field in this
young backflow is larger than elsewhere in the radio lobe, explaining the
observed radio synchrotron limb-brightening. The boundary backflow decelerates
due to small cavity pressure gradients, causing large-scale fields
perpendicular to the backflow (and synchrotron emission) to grow exponentially
unlike observations. However, if the field is random on subgrid (sub-kpc)
scales, the computed field reproduces both the magnitude and slowly decreasing
radio synchrotron emissivity observed along the backflow. The radio synchrotron
spectrum and image computed with a small-scale random field agree with VLA
observations. The total relativistic energy density in the post-jet shock
region required in computations to inflate the radio cavity matches the energy
density of relativistic electrons observed in the post-shock region of Cygnus
A. This indicates that the component in the jet and cavity that dominates the
dynamical evolution is a relativistic pair plasma.

high dynamic range images of cosmic sources with radio arrays to making
comparably high dynamic range maps of spectral power of wavelike ionospheric
phenomena. In the example presented here, we have used observations of the
total electron content (TEC) gradient derived from Very Large Array (VLA)
observations of synchrotron emission from two galaxy clusters at 330 MHz as
well as GPS-based TEC measurements from a sparse array of 33 receivers located
within New Mexico near the VLA. We show that these techniques provide a
significant improvement in signal to noise (S/N) of detected wavelike
structures by correcting for both measurement inaccuracies and wavefront
distortions. This is especially true for the GPS data when combining all
available satellite/receiver pairs, which probe a larger physical area and
likely have a wider variety of measurement errors than in the single-satellite
case. In this instance, we found the peak S/N of the detected waves was
improved by more than an order of magnitude. The data products generated by the
deconvolution procedure also allow for a reconstruction of the fluctuations as
a two-dimensional waveform/phase screen that can be used to correct for their

($\nu_2$) columns, namely tri-chi-maximal mixing ($\text{T}\chi\text{M}$) and
tri-phi-maximal mixing ($\text{T}\phi\text{M}$), were proposed. It was recently

$\text{T}\phi\text{M}$ with $\phi = \pm \frac{\pi}{16}$ leads to the solution,
$\sin^2 \theta_{13} = \frac{2}{3} \sin^2 \frac{\pi}{16}$, consistent with the
latest measurements of the reactor mixing angle, $\theta_{13}$. To obtain
$\text{T}\chi\text{M}_{(\chi=\pm \frac{\pi}{16})}$ and
$\text{T}\phi\text{M}_{(\phi=\pm \frac{\pi}{16})}$, we utilised the type I
see-saw framework with fully constrained Majorana neutrino mass matrices. These
mass matrices also resulted in a relation among the neutrino masses,
$m_1:m_2:m_3=\frac{\left(2+\sqrt{2}\right)}{1+\sqrt{2(2+\sqrt{2})}}:1:\frac{\left(2+\sqrt{2}\right)}{-1+\sqrt{2(2+\sqrt{2})}}$.

mass matrix (a symmetric $3\times3$ matrix with 6 complex degrees of freedom)
is conveniently mapped into a flavon field transforming as the complex 6
dimensional representation of $\Sigma(72\times3)$. Specific vacuum alignments
of the flavons are used to arrive at the desired mass matrices.

first time, we fit 2-dimensional models comprising a single Sersic fit and
two-component (i.e., bulge + disk) decompositions not only to the H-band light
distributions, but also to the stellar mass maps reconstructed from resolved
stellar population modeling. We confirm that the increased bulge prominence
among quiescent galaxies, as reported previously based on rest-optical
observations, remains in place when considering the distributions of stellar
mass. Moreover, we observe an increase of the typical Sersic index and
bulge-to-total ratio (with median B/T reaching 40-50%) among star-forming
galaxies above 10^11 Msun. Given that quenching for these most massive systems
is likely to be imminent, our findings suggest that significant bulge growth
precedes a departure from the star-forming main sequence. We demonstrate that
the bulge mass (and ideally knowledge of the bulge and total mass) is a more
reliable predictor of the star-forming versus quiescent state of a galaxy than
the total stellar mass. The same trends are predicted by the state-of-the-art
semi-analytic model by Somerville et al. In the latter, bulges and black holes
grow hand in hand through merging and/or disk instabilities, and AGN-feedback

central cooling times (CCTs) of the ICM and classified the groups as strong
cool-core (SCC), weak cool-core (WCC) and non-cool-core (NCC) based on their
CCTs. The total radio luminosity of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) was
obtained using radio catalog data and literature, which was compared to the CCT
to understand the link between gas cooling and radio output. We determined
K-band luminosities of the BCG with 2MASS data, and used it to constrain the
masses of the SMBH, which were then compared to the radio output. We also
tested for correlations between the BCG luminosity and the overall X-ray
luminosity and mass of the group.
  The observed cool-core/non-cool-core fractions for groups are comparable to
those of clusters. However, notable differences are seen. For clusters, all
SCCs have a central temperature drop, but for groups, this is not the case as
some SCCs have centrally rising temperature profiles. While for the cluster
sample, all SCC clusters have a central radio source as opposed to only 45% of
the NCCs, for the group sample, all NCC groups have a central radio source as
opposed to 77% of the SCC groups. For clusters, there are indications of an
anticorrelation trend between radio luminosity and CCT which is absent for the
groups. Indications of a trend of radio luminosity with black hole mass
observed in SCC clusters is absent for groups. The strong correlation observed
between the BCG luminosity and the cluster X-ray luminosity/cluster mass
weakens significantly for groups.
  We conclude that there are important differences between clusters and groups
within the ICM cooling/AGN feedback paradigm.

evolution because the period change is non-secular, and explaining this period
jitter is necessary for understanding stellar evolution and the role of
Cepheids as precise standard candles. We suggest that convection and convective
hot spots can explain the observed period jitter. Convective hot spots alter
the timing of flux maximum and minimum in the Cepheid light curve, hence change
the measured pulsation period. We present a model of random hot spots that
generate a localized flux excess that perturbs the Cepheid light curve and
consequently the pulsation period which is consistent with the observed jitter.
This result demonstrates how important understanding convection is for modeling
Cepheid stellar structure and evolution, how convection determines the red edge
of the instability strip, and just how sensitive Cepheid light curves are to
atmospheric physics.

Earth's atmosphere. At very high energy, the contribution from semi-leptonic
decays of charmed hadrons, known as the prompt neutrino flux, dominates over
the conventional flux from pion and kaon decays. This is due to the very short
lifetime of the charmed hadrons, which therefore do not lose energy before they
decay. The calculation of this process is difficult because the Bjorken-x at
which the parton distribution functions are evaluated is very small. This is a
region where QCD is not well understood, and large logarithms must be resummed.
Available parton distribution functions are not known at such small x and
extrapolations must be made. Theoretically, the fast rise of the structure
functions for small x ultimately leads to parton saturation. This contribution
describes the ""ERS"" calculation of the prompt neutrino flux, which includes
parton saturation effects in the QCD production cross section of charm quarks.
The ERS flux calculation is used by e.g. the IceCube collaboration as a
standard benchmark background. We are now updating this calculation to take
into account the recent LHC data on the charm cross section, as well as recent
theoretical developments in QCD. Some of the issues involved in this

radiation which can photo-dissociate molecular hydrogen, increasing the mass of
dark matter halos required to host star formation. Previous studies have
determined the critical mass required for efficient molecular cooling with a
constant LW background. However, the true background is expected to increase
rapidly at early times. Neglecting this evolution could underestimate star
formation in small halos that may have started to cool in the past when the LW
intensity was much lower. Background evolution is a large source of uncertainty
in pre-reionization predictions of the cosmological 21cm signal, which can be
observed with future radio telescopes. To address this, we perform
zero-dimentional one-zone calculations that follow the density, chemical
abundances, and temperature of gas in the central regions of dark matter halos,
including hierarchical growth and an evolving LW background. We begin by
studying the physics of halos subjected to a background that increases
exponentially with redshift. We find that when the intensity increases more
slowly than $J_{\rm LW}(z) \propto 10^{-z/5}$, cooling in the past is a
relatively small effect. We then self-consistently compute the cosmological LW
background over $z=15-50$ and find that cooling in the past due to an evolving
background has a modest impact. Finally, we compare these results to
three-dimensional hydrodynamical cosmological simulations with varying LW
histories. While only a small number of halos were simulated, the results are
consistent with our one-zone calculations.

blackholes to z=0 in the high resolution hydrodynamical simulation
MassiveBlack-II (MBII) which evolves a LCDM cosmology in a comoving volume
Vbox=100(Mpc/h)^3. MBII is the highest resolution simulation of this size which
includes a self-consistent model for star formation, black hole accretion and
associated feedback. We provide a simulation browser web application which
enables interactive search and tagging of halos, subhalos and their properties
and publicly release our galaxy catalogs. Our analysis of the halo mass
function (MF) in MBII reveals that baryons have strong effects, with changes in
the halo abundance of 20-35% below the knee of the MF (Mhalo < 10^13.2 Msun/h
at z=0) when compared to fits based on dark matter only simulations. We provide
a fitting function for the halo MF out to redshift z=11 and discuss how the
onset of non-universality in the MF limits the accuracy of our fit. We study
the halo occupation distribution and clustering of galaxies, in particular the
evolution and scale dependence of stochasticity and bias finding reasonable
agreement with observational data. The shape of the cosmic spectral energy
distribution predicted by MBII is consistent with observations, but lower in
amplitude. The Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) function is broadly
consistent with observations at z>=2. At z<2, the population of passive low
mass (for M*<10^9 Msun) galaxies in MBII makes the GSMF too steep compared to
observations whereas at the high mass end (M*>10^11 Msun) galaxies hosting
bright AGNs make significant contributions to the GSMF. The quasar bolometric
luminosity function is also largely consistent with observations. We note
however that more efficient AGN feedback (beyond simple thermal coupling used
here) is likely necessary for the largest, rarest objects/clusters at low
redshifts.

correcting for common experimental artifacts. Studying short (roughly 100 bp)

at the interface between insulating nonmagnetic oxides, as exemplified by the
polar LaAlO3 and nonpolar SrTiO3 has raised prospects for attaining interfacial
functionalities absent in the component materials. Yet, the microscopic origin
of such emergent phenomena remains unclear, posing obstacles to design of
improved functionalities. Using first principles defect calculations, we reveal
a unifying polarity-induced defect mechanism for both conductivity and
magnetism at polar-nonpolar interfaces of nonmagnetic insulating oxides. We
demonstrate that the polar-discontinuity across the interface triggers
thermodynamically the spontaneous formation of certain defects that in turn
cancel the polar field induced by the polar discontinuity. It turns out that
the 2DEG originates from those spontaneously formed surface donor defects
(oxygen vacancy), but the density of 2DEG is controlled by the interfacial
anti-site acceptor defects (Al-on-Ti). The interface magnetism is found to
originate from the un-ionized deep Ti-on-Al anti-site donor defects within the
LaAlO3 side near the interface. Our results suggest practical design guidelines
for inducing and controlling both 2DEG and magnetism at polar-nonpolar oxide
interfaces.

half-duplex constraint supposes that at each time instant the sources can

have been observed by XMM-Newton. We concentrate particularly on the negative
X-ray time-lags (typically seen above $10^{-4}$ Hz) i.e. soft band variations
lag the hard band variations, and we assume that they are produced by
reprocessing and reflection by the accretion disc within a lamp-post X-ray
source geometry. We also assume that the response of the accretion disc, in the
soft X-ray bands, is adequately described by the response in the neutral iron
line (Fe k$\alpha$) at 6.4 keV for which we use fully general relativistic
ray-tracing simulations to determine its time evolution. These response
functions, and thus the corresponding time-lag spectra, yield much more
realistic results than the commonly-used, but erroneous, top-hat models.
Additionally we parametrize the positive part of the time-lag spectra
(typically seen below $10^{-4}$ Hz) by a power-law. We find that the
best-fitting BH masses, M, agree quite well with those derived by other
methods, thus providing us with a new tool for BH mass determination. We find
no evidence for any correlation between M and the BH spin parameter, $\alpha$,
the viewing angle, $\theta$, or the height of the X-ray source above the disc,
$h$. Also on average, the X-ray source lies only around 3.7 gravitational radii
above the accretion disc and the viewing angles are distributed uniformly

aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We aim to characterize how the charge state of
PAHs can be used as a probe of flows of gas through protoplanetary gaps. In
this context, our goal is to understand the PAH spectra of four transitional
disks. In addition, we want to explain the observed correlation between PAH
ionization (traced by the 6.2/11.3 feature ratio) and the disk mass (traced by
the 1.3 mm luminosity). We implement a model to calculate the charge state of
PAHs in the radiative transfer code MCMax. The emission spectra and ionization
balance are calculated. A benchmark modeling grid is presented that shows how
PAH ionization and luminosity behave as a function of star and disk properties.
The PAH ionization is most sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the
electron density. In optically thick disks, where the UV field is low and the
electron density is high, PAHs are predominantly neutral. Ionized PAHs trace
low-density optically thin disk regions where the UV field is high and the
electron density is low. Such regions are characteristic of gas flows through
the gaps of transitional disks. We demonstrate that fitting the PAH spectra of
four transitional disks requires a contribution of ionized PAHs in gas flows
through the gap. The PAH spectra of transitional disks can be understood as
superpositions of neutral and ionized PAHs. For HD97048, neutral PAHs in the
optically thick disk dominate the spectrum. In the cases of HD169142, HD135344B
and Oph IRS 48, small amounts of ionized PAHs located in the gas flows through
the gap are strong contributors to the total PAH luminosity. The observed trend
between the disk mass and PAH ionization may imply that lower-mass disks have
larger gaps. Ionized PAHs in gas flows through these gaps contribute strongly
to their spectra.

collapses the probability density of a distant observer seeing an infinite red
shift at the Schwarzschild radius of the star is zero. Therefore, there is a
vanishing probability density of a black hole event horizon forming during
gravitational collapse. A grey apparent event horizon forms during the collapse
that allows information to escape.

demonstrates that state of the art numerical schemes \emph{may not} necessarily

  Furthermore, we propose a more general notion, that of \emph{entropy measure

which constructs stable approximations to entropy measure valued solutions and
provide sufficient conditions that guarantee that these approximations converge
to an entropy measure valued solution as the mesh is refined, thus providing a
viable numerical framework for systems of conservation laws in several space

proposed schemes are presented and are utilized to examine several interesting

one web commentator predicted this otherwise unlikely event publicly. This
explanation was subsequently dismissed by press articles that claim that stock
prices end near such round numbers based upon legitimate hedging activity. But
how can we know? We show that the accepted model that points to hedging as the
driving cause of prices is not quantitatively consistent with the price
movement on that day. The price moved upward too quickly over a period in which
the hedgers' position would require selling rather than buying. Under these
conditions hedgers would have driven the price away from the strike price
rather than toward it. We also show that a long published theory of the role of
hedging is incomplete mathematically, and that the correct theory results in
much weaker price movements. This evidence substantially weakens the case of
those who claim hedging as cause of anomalous market price movements. The
explanation that market manipulation is responsible for the final close cannot
be dismissed based upon unsubstantiated, even invalid, hedging claims. Such
proffered explanations shield potential illegal activity from further inquiry

we introduce nested dropout, a procedure for stochastically removing coherent
nested sets of hidden units in a neural network. We first present a sequence of
theoretical results in the simple case of a semi-linear autoencoder. We
rigorously show that the application of nested dropout enforces identifiability
of the units, which leads to an exact equivalence with PCA. We then extend the
algorithm to deep models and demonstrate the relevance of ordered
representations to a number of applications. Specifically, we use the ordered
property of the learned codes to construct hash-based data structures that
permit very fast retrieval, achieving retrieval in time logarithmic in the
database size and independent of the dimensionality of the representation. This
allows codes that are hundreds of times longer than currently feasible for
retrieval. We therefore avoid the diminished quality associated with short
codes, while still performing retrieval that is competitive in speed with
existing methods. We also show that ordered representations are a promising way
to learn adaptive compression for efficient online data reconstruction.

interest evolves over a given social interaction graph, referred to as the
\emph{social digraph}. For inference, we assume that a network of agents
monitors certain nodes in the social digraph and no agent may be able to
perform inference within its neighborhood; the agents must rely on inter-agent
communication. The key contributions of this paper include: (i) a novel
construction of the distributed estimator and distributed observability from
the first principles; (ii) a graph-theoretic agent classification that
establishes the importance and role of each agent towards inference; (iii)
characterizing the necessary conditions, based on the classification in (ii),
on the agent network to achieve distributed observability. Our results are
based on structured systems theory and are applicable to any parameter choice
of the underlying system matrix as long as the social digraph remains fixed. In
other words, any social phenomena that evolves (linearly) over a
structure-invariant social digraph may be considered--we refer to such systems
as Liner Structure-Invariant (LSI). The aforementioned contributions,
(i)--(iii), thus, only require the knowledge of the social digraph (topology)

in such clusters. Two main classes of massive star formation theory are under
active study, Core Accretion and Competitive Accretion. In Core Accretion, the
initial conditions are self-gravitating, centrally concentrated cores that
condense with a range of masses from the surrounding, fragmenting clump
environment. They then undergo relatively ordered collapse via a central disk
to form a single star or a small-N multiple. In this case, the pre-stellar core
mass function has a similar form to the stellar initial mass function. In
Competitive Accretion, the material that forms a massive star is drawn more
chaotically from a wider region of the clump without passing through a phase of
being in a massive, coherent core. In this case, massive star formation must
proceed hand in hand with star cluster formation. If stellar densities become
very high near the cluster center, then collisions between stars may also help
to form the most massive stars. We review recent theoretical and observational
progress towards understanding massive star formation, considering physical and
chemical processes, comparisons with low and intermediate-mass stars, and
connections to star cluster formation.

chemical dynamics, and more recently in novel materials such as graphene, whose
electronic band structure possess Dirac points. Here we discuss diabolical
points in an optomechanical system formed by multiple scatterers in an optical
cavity with periodic boundary conditions. Such configuration is close to
experimental setups using micro-toroidal rings with indentations or near-field
scatterers. We find that the optomechanical coupling is no longer an analytic
function near the diabolical point and demonstrate the topological phase
arising through the mechanical motion. Similar to a Fabry-Perot resonator, the
optomechanical coupling can grow with the number of scatterers. We also
introduce a minimal quantum model of a diabolical point, which establishes a
connection to the motion of an arbitrary-spin particle in a 2D parabolic
quantum dot with spin-orbit coupling.

during unusual magnetic storm on 21 January 2005. We have found that during the
storm from 1712 to 2400 UT, the subsolar magnetopause was continuously located
inside geosynchronous orbit due to strong compression. The compression was
found to be extremely strong from 1846 to 2035 UT when the dense plasma of fast
erupting filament produced the solar wind dynamic pressure Pd peaked up to >100
nPa and, in the first time, the upstream solar wind was observed at
geosynchronous orbit during almost 2 hours. Under the extreme compression, the
outer magnetosphere at L > 5 was pushed inward and the outer radiation belt
particles with energies of several tens of keV moved earthward, became
adiabatically accelerated and accumulated in the inner magnetosphere at L < 4
that produced the intensified ring current with an exceptionally long lifetime.
The observations were compared with predictions of various empirical and first
principles models. All the models failed to predict the magnetospheric dynamics
under the extreme compression when the minimal magnetopause distance was
estimated to be ~3 Re. The inconsistencies between the model predictions and
observations might result from distortions of plasma measurements by extreme
heliospheric conditions consisting in very fast solar wind streams (~1000 km/s)
and intense fluxes of solar energetic particles. We speculated that anomalous
dynamics of the magnetosphere could be well described by the models if the He
abundance in the solar wind was assumed to be >20%, which is well appropriate
for erupting filaments and which is in agreement with the upper 27% threshold
for the He/H ratio obtained from Cluster measurements.

to accurately model distributions over functions is critical to the
effectiveness of Bayesian optimization. Although Gaussian processes provide a
flexible prior over functions which can be queried efficiently, there are
various classes of functions that remain difficult to model. One of the most
frequently occurring of these is the class of non-stationary functions. The
optimization of the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms is a problem
domain in which parameters are often manually transformed a priori, for example
by optimizing in ""log-space,"" to mitigate the effects of spatially-varying
length scale. We develop a methodology for automatically learning a wide family
of bijective transformations or warpings of the input space using the Beta
cumulative distribution function. We further extend the warping framework to
multi-task Bayesian optimization so that multiple tasks can be warped into a
jointly stationary space. On a set of challenging benchmark optimization tasks,
we observe that the inclusion of warping greatly improves on the
state-of-the-art, producing better results faster and more reliably.

In order to reduce such casualties, collisions warning systems has been studied
extensively. These systems are built by taking the driver reaction times into
account. However, most of the existing literature focuses on characterizing how
driver reaction times vary across an entire population. Therefore, many of the
warnings that are given turn out to be false alarms. A false alarm occurs
whenever a warning is sent, but it is not needed. This would nagate any safety
benefit of the system, and could even reduce the overall safety if warnings
become a distraction. In this paper, we propose our solution to address the
described problem; First, we briefly describe our method for estimating the
distribution of brake response times for a particular driver using data from a
Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) system. Then, we investigate how brake
response times of individual drivers can be used in collision warning
algorithms to reduce false alarm rates while still maintaining a high level of
safety. This will yield a system that is overall more reliable and trustworthy
for drivers, which could lead to wider adoption and applicability for V2V/V2I
communication systems. Moreover, we show how false alarm rate varies with
respect to probability of accident. Our simulation results show that by
individualizing collision warnings the number of false alarms can be reduced
more than $50\%$. Then, we conclude safety applications could potentially take
full advantage of being customized to an individual's characteristics.

commonly exhibit significant order on large temporal or spatial scales compared
to the otherwise random motions within the hosting system. Such ordered fields
can be measured in the case of planets, stars, and galaxies, or inferred
indirectly by the action of their dynamical influence, such as jets. Whether
large scale fields are amplified in situ or a remnant from previous stages of
an object's history is often debated for objects without a definitive magnetic
activity cycle. Magnetic helicity, a measure of twist and linkage of magnetic
field lines, is a unifying tool for understanding large scale field evolution
for both mechanisms of origin. Its importance stems from its two basic
properties: (1) magnetic helicity is typically better conserved than magnetic
energy; and (2) the magnetic energy associated with a fixed amount of magnetic
helicity is minimized when the system relaxes this helical structure to the
largest scale available. Here I discuss how magnetic helicity has come to help
us understand the saturation of and sustenance of large scale dynamos, the need
for either local or global helicity fluxes to avoid dynamo quenching, and the
associated observational consequences. I also discuss how magnetic helicity
acts as a hindrance to turbulent diffusion of large scale fields, and thus a
helper for fossil remnant large scale field origin models in some contexts. I
briefly discuss the connection between large scale fields and accretion disk
theory as well. The goal here is to provide a conceptual primer to help the
reader efficiently penetrate the literature.

energy (DE), to the predicted Hubble outflow around a system of galaxies. In
particular, we are interested in the difference between two models: 1) The
standard $\Lambda$CDM model, with the everywhere constant DE density, and 2)
the ""Swiss cheese model"", where the universe is as old as the standard model,
but the DE density is zero on short scales, including the environment of the
system.
  We calculate the current predicted outflow patterns of dwarf galaxies around
the Local Group-like system, using different values for the mass of the group,
the local dark energy density, and the time of ejection of the dwarf galaxies,
treated as test particles. These results are compared with the observed Hubble
flow around the Local Group.
  The predicted distance-velocity relations around galaxy groups are not alone
very sensitive indicators of the dark energy density, due to the obsevational
scatter and the uncertainties caused by the used mass of the group and a range
in the ejection times. In general, the Local Group outflow data are in
agreement with the local DE density being equal to the global one, if the mass
is about $4 \times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$; a lower mass of about $2 \times 10^{12}
M_{\odot}$ or less could suggest a zero local DE density. The dependence of the
inferred DE density on the mass is a handicap in this and other common
dynamical methods. This emphasizes the need to use different approaches
together, for constraining the local dark energy density.

exhibit self-similarity. A lot of researches on the structures and processes on
real and artificial fractal complex networks have been done, drawing an analogy
to critical phenomena. However, the non-Markovian dynamics on fractal networks
has not been understood well yet. We here study the self-avoiding walk on
complex fractal networks through the mapping of the self-avoiding walk to the
n-vector model by a generating function formalism. First, we analytically
calculate the critical exponent {\nu} and the effective coordination number
(the connective constant) by a renormalization-group analysis in various
fractal dimensions. We find that the exponent {\nu} is equal to the exponent of
displacement, which describes the speed of diffusion in terms of the shortest
distance. Second, by obtaining an exact solution, we present an example which
supports the well-known conjecture that the universality class of the
self-avoiding walk is not determined only by a fractal dimension. Our finding
suggests that the scaling theory of polymers can be applied to graphs which
lack the Euclidian distance as well. Furthermore, the self-avoiding walk has
been exactly solved only on a few lattices embedded in the Euclidian space, but
we show that consideration on general graphs can simplify analytic calculations
and leads to a better understanding of critical phenomena. The scaling theory
of the self-avoiding path will shed light on the relationship between path
numeration problems in graph theory and statistical nature of paths.

artificial acoustic phonon softening and unphysical lifting of degeneracies
along high symmetry directions. We propose a scheme to investigate the
convergence of the IFC with respect to the supercell sizes. The phonon

they generally act at nibble or at byte level. The MDS matrices are associated
to MDS codes of ratio 1/2. The most famous example is the MixColumns operation
of the AES block cipher.
  In this example, the MDS matrix was carefully chosen to obtain compact and
efficient implementations. However, this MDS matrix is dedicated to 8-bit
words, and is not always adapted to lightweight applications. Recently, several
studies have been devoted to the construction of recursive diffusion layers.
Such a method allows to apply an MDS matrix using an iterative process which
looks like a Feistel network with linear functions instead of nonlinear.
  Our approach is quite different. We present a generic construction of
classical MDS matrices that are not recursively computed, but that are strong
symmetric in order to either accelerate their evaluation with a minimal number
of look-up tables, or to perform this evaluation with a minimal number of gates
in a circuit. We call this particular kind of matrices ""dyadic matrices"", since
they are related to dyadic codes. We study some basic properties of such
matrices. We introduce a generic construction of involutive dyadic MDS matrices
from Reed Solomon codes. Finally, we discuss the implementation aspects of
these dyadic MDS matrices in order to build efficient block ciphers.

\left(8.257^{+0.045}_{-0.012}\right) \times10^{-3}$ by varying the scale
$\mu_{r}\in[M_{t}/2$, $2M_{t}]$. By defining a ratio, $\Delta
R=\Delta\rho/3X_t-1$, which shows the relative importance of the QCD
corrections, it is found that its scale error is $\sim \pm9 \%$ at the two-loop
level, which changes to $\sim\pm4\%$ at the three-loop level and $\sim \pm
2.5\%$ at the four-loop level, respectively. These facts well explain why the
conventional scale uncertainty constitutes an important error for estimating
the $\rho$ parameter. On the other hand, by applying the PMC scale setting, the
four-loop estimation $\Delta\rho|_{\rm N^3LO}$ shall be almost fixed to
$8.228\times10^{-3}$, which indicates that the conventional scale error has
been eliminated. We observe the pQCD convergence for the $\rho$ parameter has
also been greatly improved due to the elimination of the divergent renormalon
terms. As applications of the present QCD improved $\rho$ parameter, we show
the shifts of the $W$-boson mass and the effective leptonic weak-mixing angle
due to $\Delta\rho$ can be reduced to $\delta M_{W}|_{\rm N^3LO} =0.7$ MeV and

various scales. On a cosmological scale, matter is usually distributed along
filaments, and filaments are also typical features of the interstellar medium.
Within a cosmic filament, matter can contract and form galaxies, whereas an
interstellar gas filament can clump into a series of bead-like structures which
can then turn into stars. To investigate the growth of such instabilities, we
derive a local dispersion relation for an idealized self-gravitating filament,
and study some of its properties. Our idealized picture consists of an infinite
self-gravitating and rotating cylinder with pressure and density related by a
polytropic equation of state. We assume no specific density distribution, treat
matter as a fluid, and use hydrodynamics to derive the linearized equations
that govern the local perturbations. We obtain a dispersion relation for
axisymmetric perturbations and study its properties in the (k_R, k_z) phase
space, where k_R and k_z are respectively the radial and longitudinal
wavenumbers. While the boundary between the stable and unstable regimes is
symmetrical in k_R and k_z and analogous to the Jeans criterion, the most
unstable mode displays an asymmetry that could constrain the shape of the
structures that form within the filament. Here the results are applied to a
fiducial interstellar filament, but could be extended for more astrophysical
systems such as cosmological filaments and tidal tails.

occlusion and appearance change. Here, the target is partitioned into a number
of patches. Then, the appearance of each patch is modeled using a dictionary
composed of corresponding target patches in previous frames. In each frame, the
target is found among a set of candidates generated by a particle filter, via a
likelihood measure that is shown to be proportional to the sum of
patch-reconstruction errors of each candidate. Since the target's appearance
often changes slowly in a video sequence, it is assumed that the target in the
current frame and the best candidates of a small number of previous frames,
belong to a common subspace. This is imposed using joint sparse representation
to enforce the target and previous best candidates to have a common sparsity
pattern. Moreover, an occlusion detection scheme is proposed that uses
patch-reconstruction errors and a prior probability of occlusion, extracted
from an adaptive Markov chain, to calculate the probability of occlusion per
patch. In each frame, occluded patches are excluded when updating the
dictionary. Extensive experimental results on several challenging sequences
shows that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art trackers.

and are assigned to chemical and structural modifications of the layers. The
relative variation of the constant and anisotropic torque terms as a function
of annealing temperature is opposite for the field-like and antidamping
torques. Measurements of the switching probability using sub-{\mu}s current
pulses show that the critical current increases with the magnetic anisotropy of
the layers, whereas the switching efficiency, measured as the ratio of magnetic
anisotropy energy and pulse energy, decreases. The optimal annealing
temperature to achieve maximum magnetic anisotropy, saturation magnetization,
and switching efficiency is determined to be between 240 degrees and 270
degrees C.

also near to the Banzhaf vector of a k-member committee. We show that such

reasonably well using Chakrabarti-Titarchuk solution of two component advective
flow (TCAF). This model requires two accretion rates, namely, the Keplerian
disk accretion rate and the halo accretion rate, the latter being composed of a
sub-Keplerian, low angular momentum flow which may or may not develop a shock.
In this solution, the relevant parameter is the relative importance of the halo
(which creates the Compton cloud region) rate with respect to the Keplerian
disk rate (soft photon source). Though this model has been used earlier to
manually fit data of several black hole candidates quite satisfactorily, for
the first time, we made it user friendly by implementing it into XSPEC software
of GSFC/NASA. This enables any user to extract physical parameters of the
accretion flows, such as two accretion rates, the shock location, the shock
strength etc. for any black hole candidate. We provide some examples of fitting
a few cases using this model. Most importantly, unlike any other model, we show
that TCAF is capable of predicting timing properties from the spectral fits,
since in TCAF, a shock is responsible for deciding spectral slopes as well as
QPO frequencies.

availability of several digital forensics tools, investigators still approach
each crime case from scratch, postulating potential hypotheses and analysing
large volumes of data. This paper proposes to explicitly model forensic
requirements in order to engineer software systems that are forensic-ready and
guide the activities of a digital investigation. Forensic requirements relate
some speculative hypotheses of a crime to the evidence that should be collected
and analysed in a crime scene. In contrast to existing approaches, we propose
to perform proactive activities to preserve important - potentially ephemeral -
evidence, depending on the risk of a crime to take place. Once an investigation
starts, the evidence collected proactively is analysed to assess if some of the
speculative hypotheses of a crime hold and what further evidence is necessary
to support them. For each hypothesis that is satisfied, a structured argument
is generated to demonstrate how the evidence collected supports that
hypothesis. Our evaluation results suggest that the approach provides correct
investigative findings and reduces significantly the amount of evidence to be
collected and the hypotheses to be analysed.

strategies via dynamic programming subject to total variation distance
ambiguity on the conditional distribution of the controlled process. We
formulate the stochastic control problem using minimax theory, in which the
control minimizes the pay-off while the conditional distribution, from the
total variation distance set, maximizes it.
  First, we investigate the maximization of a linear functional on the space of
probability measures on abstract spaces, among those probability measures which
are within a total variation distance from a nominal probability measure, and
then we give the maximizing probability measure in closed form. Second, we
utilize the solution of the maximization to solve minimax stochastic control
with deterministic control strategies, under a Markovian and a non-Markovian
assumption, on the conditional distributions of the controlled process. The
results of this part include: 1) Minimax optimization subject to total
variation distance ambiguity constraint; 2) new dynamic programming recursions,
which involve the oscillator seminorm of the value function, in addition to the
standard terms; 3) new infinite horizon discounted dynamic programming
equation, the associated contractive property, and a new policy iteration
algorithm. Finally, we provide illustrative examples for both the finite and
infinite horizon cases. For the infinite horizon case we invoke the new policy
iteration algorithm to compute the optimal strategies.

the accuracy of our two-band NRG by the spatial sum-rules of the equilibrium
correlation functions and the reproduction of the analytically exactly known
spin-correlation function of the decoupled Fermi sea. We find a remarkable
building up of Kondo-correlation outside of the light cone defined by the Fermi
velocity of the host metal. By employing a perturbative approach exact in
second-order of the Kondo coupling, we connect these surprising correlations to
the intrinsic spin-density entanglement of the Fermi sea. The thermal wave
length supplies a cutoff scale at finite temperatures beyond which correlations
are exponentially suppressed. We present data for the frequency dependent
retarded spin-spin susceptibility and use the results to calculate the
real-time response of a weak perturbation in linear response: within the

based on a preliminary clustering of sample units on the basis of the time
specific responses only. This approach represents an useful estimation tool
when a large number of response variables are observed at each time occasion.
In such a context, full maximum likelihood estimation, which is typically based
on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, may have some drawbacks, essentially
due to the presence of many local maxima of the model likelihood. Moreover, the
EM algorithm may be particularly slow to converge, and may become unstable with
complex LM models. We prove the consistency of the proposed three-step
estimator when the number of response variables tends to infinity. We also show
the results of a simulation study aimed at evaluating the performance of the
proposed alternative approach with respect to the full likelihood method. We
finally illustrate an application to a real dataset on the health status of

stars. We confirm the presence of a large foreground population towards the
Orion A cloud. This population contains several distinct subgroups, including
NGC1980 and NGC1981, and stretches across several degrees in front of the Orion
A cloud. By comparing the location of their sequence in various color-magnitude
diagrams with other clusters, we found a distance and an age of 380pc and
5~10Myr, in good agreement with previous estimates. Our final sample includes
2123 candidate members and is complete from below the hydrogen-burning limit to
about 0.3Msun, where the data start to be limited by saturation. Extrapolating
the mass function to the high masses, we estimate a total number of ~2600
members in the surveyed region. We confirm the presence of a rich, contiguous,
and essentially coeval population of about 2600 foreground stars in front of
the Orion A cloud, loosely clustered around NGC1980, NGC1981, and a new group
in the foreground of the OMC-2/3. For the area of the cloud surveyed, this
result implies that there are more young stars in the foreground population
than young stars inside the cloud. Assuming a normal initial mass function, we
estimate that between one to a few supernovae must have exploded in the
foreground population in the past few million years, close to the surface of
Orion A, which might be responsible, together with stellar winds, for the
structure and star formation activity in these clouds. This long-overlooked

contexts. Their ubiquitousness makes them pivotal in empowering disabled
people. However, if no inclusive approaches are provided, it becomes a strong
vehicle of exclusion. Even though current solutions try to compensate for the
lack of sight, not all information reaches the blind user. Good spatial ability
is still required to make sense of the device and its interface, as well as the
need to memorize positions on screen or keys and associated actions in a
keypad. Those problems are compounded by many individual attributes such as
age, age of blindness onset or tactile sensitivity which often are forgotten by
designers. Worse, the entire blind population is recurrently thought of as
homogeneous (often stereotypically so). Thus all users face the same solutions,
ignoring their specific capabilities and needs. We usually ignore this
diversity as we have the ability to adapt and become experts in interfaces that
were probably maladjusted to begin with. This adaptation is not always within
reach. Interaction with mobile devices is highly visually demanding which
widens this gap amongst blind people. It is paramount to understand the impact
of individual differences and their relationship with demands to enable the
deployment of more inclusive solutions. We explore individual differences among
blind people and assess how they are related with mobile interface demands,
both at low (e.g. performing an on-screen gesture) and high level (text-entry)
tasks. Results confirmed that different ability levels have significant impact
on the performance attained by a blind person. Particularly, otherwise ignored
attributes like tactile acuity, pressure sensitivity, spatial ability or verbal
IQ have shown to be matched with specific mobile demands and parametrizations.

monad or in the coKleisli category of a comonad. The duality between monads and
comonads corresponds, in general, to a symmetry between construction and
observation, for instance between raising an exception and looking up a state.
Thanks to the properties of adjunction one may go one step further: the
coKleisli-on-Kleisli category of a monad provides a kind of observation with
respect to a given construction, while dually the Kleisli-on-coKleisli category
of a comonad provides a kind of construction with respect to a given
observation. In the previous examples this gives rise to catching an exception
and updating a state. However, the interpretation of computational effects is
usually based on a category which is not self-dual, like the category of sets.
This leads to a breaking of the monad-comonad duality. For instance, in a
distributive category the state effect has much better properties than the
exception effect. This remark provides a novel point of view on the usual
mechanism for handling exceptions. The aim of this paper is to build an
equational semantics for handling exceptions based on the coKleisli-on-Kleisli
category of the monad of exceptions. We focus on n-ary functions and
conditionals. We propose a programmer's language for exceptions and we prove
that it has the required behaviour with respect to n-ary functions and

Benzylium and 1-phenylethyl cations produced from electrosprayed benzylamine
and phenylethylamine solutions, respectively, were stored in a cryogenically
cooled quadrupole ion trap and photodissociated by an OPO laser, scanned in
parts of the UV and visible regions (600-225 nm). The electronic states and
active vibrational modes of the benzylium and 1-phenylethyl cations as well as
those of their tropylium or methyl tropylium isomers have been calculated with
ab initio methods for comparison with the spectra observed. Sharp vibrational
progressions are observed in the visible region while the absorption features
are much broader in the UV. The visible spectrum of the benzylium cation is
similar to that obtained in an argon tagging experiment [V. Dryza, N. Chalyavi,
J.A. Sanelli, and E.J. Bieske, J. Chem. Phys. 137, 204304 (2012)], with an
additional splitting assigned to Fermi resonances. The visible spectrum of the
1-phenylethyl cation also shows vibrational progressions. For both cations, the
second electronic transition is observed in the UV, around 33 000 cm-1 (4.1
eV), and shows a broadened vibrational progression. In both cases the S2
optimized geometry is non planar. The third electronic transition observed
around 40 000 cm-1 (5.0 eV) is even broader with no apparent vibrational
structures, which is indicative of either a fast non-radiative process or a
very large change in geometry between the excited and the ground states. The
oscillator strengths calculated for tropylium and methyl tropylium are weak.
Therefore, these isomeric structures are most likely not responsible for these
absorption features. Finally, the fragmentation pattern changes in the second
and third electronic states: C2H2 loss becomes predominant at higher excitation
energies, for both cations.

obtained directly from the standard Koba-Nielsen like representation is valid
in a region of values of \alpha' that does not include \alpha'=0. Analytic
continuation is therefore needed since contours are pinched by poles as \alpha'
approaches 0. Deforming contours that get pinched by poles generates a set of
(n-3)! multidimensional residues left behind which contain all the field theory
information. We end by drawing some analogies between the field theory formulas
obtained by this method and those derived recently from using the scattering
equations.

Hamiltonians for the Laplacian on these spaces. A conventional quantum
waveguide is an $\varepsilon$-tubular neighbourhood of a curve in

tube in the asymptotic limit $\varepsilon\to0$. We generalise this by
considering fibre bundles $M$ over a $d$-dimensional submanifold
$B\subset\mathbb{R}^{d+k}$ with fibres diffeomorphic to $F\subset\mathbb{R}^k$,
whose total space is embedded into an $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $B$. From
this point of view $B$ takes the role of the curve and $F$ that of the
disc-shaped cross-section of a conventional quantum waveguide. Our approach
allows, among other things, for waveguides whose cross-sections $F$ are
deformed along $B$ and also the study of the Laplacian on the boundaries of
such waveguides. By applying recent results on the adiabatic limit of
Schr\""odinger operators on fibre bundles we show, in particular, that for small
energies the dynamics and the spectrum of the Laplacian on $M$ are reflected by
the adiabatic approximation associated to the ground state band of the normal
Laplacian. We give explicit formulas for the according effective operator on
$L^2(B)$ in various scenarios, thereby improving and extending many of the
known results on quantum waveguides and quantum layers in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

multicellular colonies of flagellates ($\textit{Volvox}$) are approximately
spherical in shape and swim using beating arrays of cilia or short flagella
covering their surfaces. Their physical actuation on the fluid may be
mathematically modeled as the generation of surface velocities on a continuous
spherical surface -- a model known in the literature as squirming, which has
been used to address various aspects of the biological physics of locomotion.
Previous analyses of squirming assumed axisymmetric fluid motion and hence
restricted all swimming kinematics to take place along a line. In this paper we
generalize squirming to three spatial dimensions. We derive analytically the
flow field surrounding a spherical squirmer with arbitrary surface motion, and
use it to derive its three-dimensional translational and rotational swimming
kinematics. We then use our results to physically interpret the flow field
induced by the swimmer in terms of fundamental flow singularities up to terms
decaying spatially as $\sim 1/r^3$. Our results will enable to develop new

quantitative research in the empirical sciences including scientometrics.
Nevertheless, since their introduction nearly a century ago significance tests
have been controversial. Many researchers are not aware of the numerous
criticisms raised against NHST. As practiced, NHST has been characterized as a
null ritual that is overused and too often misapplied and misinterpreted. NHST
is in fact a patchwork of two fundamentally different classical statistical
testing models, often blended with some wishful quasi-Bayesian interpretations.
This is undoubtedly a major reason why NHST is very often misunderstood. But
NHST also has intrinsic logical problems and the epistemic range of the
information provided by such tests is much more limited than most researchers
recognize. In this article we introduce to the scientometric community the
theoretical origins of NHST, which is mostly absent from standard statistical
textbooks, and we discuss some of the most prevalent problems relating to the
practice of NHST and trace these problems back to the mixup of the two
different theoretical origins. Finally, we illustrate some of the
misunderstandings with examples from the scientometric literature and bring
forward some modest recommendations for a more sound practice in quantitative
data analysis.

approximation, a model approximating the motion of a thin vortex filament) and
the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation (NLS) has proven very useful in the past,
since it allows one to construct new solutions to the LIA once a solution to
the NLS is known. In the present paper, the quantum form of the LIA (which
includes mutual friction effects) is put into correspondence with a type of
complex nonlinear dispersive partial differential equation (PDE) with cubic
nonlinearity (similar in form to a Ginsburg-Landau equation, with additional
nonlinear terms). Transforming the quantum LIA in such a way enables one to
obtain quantum vortex filament solutions once solutions to this dispersive PDE
are known. From our quantum Hasimoto transformation, we determine the form and
behavior of Stokes waves and a standing 1-soliton solution under normal and
binormal friction effects. The soliton solution on a quantum vortex filament is
a natural generalization of the classical 1-soliton solution constructed
mathematically by Hasimoto (which motivated subsequent real-world experiments).
The quantum Hasimoto transformation is useful when normal fluid velocity is
relatively weak, so for the case where the normal fluid velocity is dominant we
resort to other approaches. We consider the dynamics of the tangent vector to
the vortex filament directly from the quantum LIA, and this approach, while
less elegant than the quantum Hasimoto transformation, enables us to study
waves primarily driven by the normal fluid velocity.

systems, periodically check the integrity of stored objects to assure users of
their correctness. To do so, prior solutions calculate integrity metadata and
require the repository to store it alongside the actual data objects. This
integrity metadata is essential for regularly verifying the correctness of the
stored data objects. To safeguard and detect damage to this metadata, prior
solutions rely on widely visible media, that is unaffiliated third parties, to
store and provide back digests of the metadata to verify it is intact. However,
they do not address recovery of the integrity metadata in case of damage or
attack by an adversary. In essence, they do not preserve this metadata. We
introduce IntegrityCatalog, a system that collects all integrity related
metadata in a single component, and treats them as first class objects,
managing both their integrity and their preservation. We introduce a
treap-based persistent authenticated dictionary managing arbitrary length
key/value pairs, which we use to store all integrity metadata, accessible
simply by object name. Additionally, IntegrityCatalog is a distributed system
that includes a network protocol that manages both corruption detection and
preservation of this metadata, using administrator-selected network peers with
two possible roles. Verifiers store and offer attestations on digests and have
minimal storage requirements, while preservers efficiently synchronize a
complete copy of the catalog to assist in recovery in case of a detected
catalog compromise on the local system. We describe our prototype
implementation of IntegrityCatalog, measure its performance empirically, and
demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world situations, with worst measured
throughput of approximately 1K insertions per second, and 2K verified search
