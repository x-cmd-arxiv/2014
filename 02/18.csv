III], and [Ar III] are employed to search for evidence of non-Maxwellian
electron distributions, namely $\kappa$ distributions, in a sample of
well-observed Galactic H II regions. By computing new effective collision
strengths for all these systems and A-values when necessary (e.g. S II), and by
comparing with previous collisional and radiative datasets, we have been able
to obtain realistic estimates of the electron-temperature dispersion caused by
the atomic data, which in most cases are not larger than $\sim 10$%. If the
uncertainties due to both observation and atomic data are then taken into
account, it is plausible to determine for some nebulae a representative average
temperature while in others there are at least two plasma excitation regions.
For the latter, it is found that the diagnostic temperature differences in the
high-excitation region, e.g. $T_e$(O III), $T_e$(S III), and $T_e$(Ar III),
cannot be conciliated by invoking $\kappa$ distributions. For the low
excitation region, it is possible in some, but not all, cases to arrive at a
common, lower temperature for [N II], [O II], and [S II] with $\kappa\approx
10$, which would then lead to significant abundance enhancements for these
ions. An analytic formula is proposed to generate accurate $\kappa$-averaged
excitation rate coefficients (better than 10% for $\kappa \geq 5$) from
temperature tabulations of the Maxwell-Boltzmann effective collision strengths.

catastrophic bifurcation breakdowns or transitions, proceeded by flickering
phenomenon, are present on notoriously significant and unpredictable financial
markets. Overall, in this work we developed various metrics associated with
catastrophic bifurcation transitions, in particular, the catastrophic slowing
down (analogous to the critical slowing down). All these things were considered
on a well-defined example of financial markets of small and middle to large
capitalization. The catastrophic bifurcation transition seems to be connected
with the question of whether the early-warning signals are present in financial
markets. This question continues to fascinate both the research community and
the general public. Interestingly, such early-warning signals have recently
been identified and explained to be a consequence of a catastrophic bifurcation
transition phenomenon observed in multiple physical systems, e.g. in
ecosystems, climate dynamics and in medicine (epileptic seizure and asthma
attack). In the present work we provide an analogical, positive identification
of such phenomenon by examining its several different indicators in the context
of a well-defined daily bubble; this bubble was induced by the recent worldwide
financial crisis on typical financial markets of small and middle to large
capitalization.

neighbors in a social network. This imitating behavior might lead to the
strategic decision of adopting a public behavior that differs from what the
agent believes is the right one and this can subvert the behavior of the
population as a whole.
  In this paper, we consider the case in which agents express preferences over
two alternatives and model social pressure with the majority dynamics: at each
step an agent is selected and its preference is replaced by the majority of the
preferences of her neighbors. In case of a tie, the agent does not change her
current preference. A profile of the agents' preferences is stable if the
preference of each agent coincides with the preference of at least half of the
neighbors (thus, the system is in equilibrium).
  We ask whether there are network topologies that are robust to social
pressure. That is, we ask if there are graphs in which the majority of
preferences in an initial profile always coincides with the majority of the
preference in all stable profiles reachable from that profile. We completely
characterize the graphs with this robustness property by showing that this is
possible only if the graph has no edge or is a clique or very close to a
clique. In other words, except for this handful of graphs, every graph admits
at least one initial profile of preferences in which the majority dynamics can
subvert the initial majority. We also show that deciding whether a graph admits
a minority that becomes majority is NP-hard when the minority size is at most
1/4-th of the social network size.

can produce radio emission known as Type II bursts. In the absence of direct
imaging, accurate estimates of coronal electron densities, magnetic field
strengths and Alfv\'en speeds are required in order to calculate the kinematics
of shocks. To date, 1D radial models have been used, but these are not
appropriate for shocks propagating in non-radial directions. Here, we study a
coronal shock wave associated with a CME and Type II radio burst using 2D
electron density and Alfv\'en speed maps to determine the locations that shocks
are excited as the CME expands through the corona. Coronal density maps were
obtained from emission measures derived from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA) on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) and polarized brightness
measurements from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on
board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). Alfv\'en speed maps were
calculated using these density maps and magnetic field extrapolations from the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI). The computed density and Alfv\'en
speed maps were then used to calculate the shock kinematics in non-radial
directions. Using the kinematics of the Type II burst and associated shock, we
find our observations to be consistent with the formation of a shock located at
the CME flanks where the Alfv\'en speed has a local minimum. 1D density models
are not appropriate for shocks that propagate non-radially along the flanks of
a CME. Rather, the 2D density, magnetic field and Alfv\'en speed maps described
here give a more accurate method for determining the fundamental properties of
shocks and their relation to CMEs.

during M phase PP2A-B55's attention is diverted to pEndos, which binds much
more avidly and is dephosphorylated more slowly than other substrates. When Gwl
is inactivated during the M phase-to-interphase transition, the dynamic balance
changes: pEndos dephosphorylated by PP2A-B55 cannot be replaced, so the

preferences of a decision maker. A popular implementation of the method is
based on solving an eigenvalue problem for M - the matrix of pairwise
comparisons. This does not take into account the actual values of preference.
The Heuristic Rating Estimation (HRE) approach is a modification of this method
in which allows modelling of the reference values. To determine the relative
order of preferences is to solve a certain linear equation system defined by
the matrix A and the constant term vector b (both derived from M). The article
explores the properties of these equation systems. In particular, it is proven
that for some small data inconsistency the A matrix is an M-matrix, hence the
equation proposed by the HRE approach has a unique strictly positive solution.

the application of bitmap indexes to more advanced queries. We want to extend
the applicability of bitmap indexes. As a starting point, we consider symmetric

  It may not be immediately obvious to an engineer how to use bitmap indexes

topological phases, namely those with abelian braiding statistics.
Specifically, we find that an abelian topological phase can be realized by a
string-net model if and only if (i) it has a vanishing thermal Hall conductance
and (ii) it has at least one Lagrangian subgroup --- a subset of quasiparticles
with particular topological properties. Equivalently, we find that an abelian
topological phase is realizable if and only if it supports a gapped edge. We
conjecture that the latter criterion generalizes to the non-abelian case. We
establish these results by systematically constructing all possible abelian
string-net models and analyzing the quasiparticle braiding statistics in each
model. We show that the low energy effective field theories for these models
are multicomponent U(1) Chern-Simons theories, and we derive the K-matrix
description of each model. An additional feature of this work is that the
models we construct are more general than the original string-net models, due
to several new ingredients. First, we introduce two new objects $\gamma,
\alpha$ into the construction which are related to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and
$\mathbb{Z}_3$ Frobenius-Schur indicators. Second, we do not assume parity
invariance. As a result, we can realize topological phases that were not
accessible to the original construction, including phases that break
time-reversal and parity symmetry.

The dependence of the mass
limit to the bulk fermion mass is explored. In the bulk conformal limit, the
mass limit saturates at a value identical to the mass limit of a radiation star
or the AdS space filling with pure radiation. The temperature and entropy of
the degenerate AdS star in the bulk conformal limit is zero in contrast to the
radiation star. Holographically, the universal mass limit corresponds to the
upper limit of the deconfinement temperature in the dual gauge picture. The QGP
at this temperature is dual to the large black hole and the heat capacity is
positive. When the fermion mass increases, the mass limit falls into the range
of the small black holes. We found that even though the small black hole has
negative heat capacity, the AdS box allows possibilities that it remains in
thermal equilibrium with the radiation as long as the size of the black hole is
not smaller than a critical size. Consequently, the dual QGP with negative heat
capacity can be produced and remains stable thermodynamically at temperature
below a saturation temperature $T_{2}$. The QGP with negative heat capacity
produced at higher temperature will still condensate completely into a gas of

learning setting, in which algorithms work in rounds. On each round an
algorithm receives an input and makes a prediction. Then, it can decide whether
to query a label, and if so to update its model, otherwise the input is
discarded. Most of this work is focused on the stationary case, where it is
assumed that there is a fixed target model, and the performance of the
algorithm is compared to a fixed model. However, in many real-world
applications, such as spam prediction, the best target function may drift over
time, or have shifts from time to time. We develop a novel selective sampling
algorithm for the drifting setting, analyze it under no assumptions on the
mechanism generating the sequence of instances, and derive new mistake bounds

intensive concerns on magnetic involved superconductors. Prominent features of
ferropnictide superconductors are becoming apparent: the parent compounds
exhibit antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordered spin density wave (SDW) state; the
magnetic phase transition is always accompanied to a crystal structural
transition; superconductivity can be induced by suppressing the SDW phase via
either chemical doping or applied external pressure to the parent state. These
features generated considerable interests on the interplay between magnetism
and structure in chemical doped samples, showing crystal structure transitions
always precedes to or coincide with magnetic transition. Pressure tuned
transition on the other hand would be more straightforward to superconducting
mechanism studies since there are no disorder effects caused by chemical
doping; however, remarkably little is known about the interplay in the parent
compounds under controlled pressure due to the experimental challenge of in
situ measuring both of magnetic & crystal structure evolution at high pressure
& low temperatures. Here we show from combined synchrotron Mossbauer and x-ray
diffraction at high pressures that the magnetic ordering surprisingly precedes
the structural transition at high pressures in the parent compound BaFe2As2, in
sharp contrast to the chemical doping case. The results can be well understood
in terms of the spin fluctuations in the emerging nematic phase before the long
range magnetic order that sheds new light on understanding how parent compound
evolves from a SDW state to a superconducting phase, a key scientific inquiry
of iron based superconductors.

to work more efficiently compared to other popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods (such as random walk Metropolis-Hastings) in generating samples
from a posterior distribution. A general framework for HMC based on the use of
graphical processing units (GPUs) is shown to greatly reduce the computing time
needed for Bayesian inference. The most expensive computational tasks in HMC
are the evaluation of the posterior kernel and computing its gradient with
respect to the parameters of interest. One of primary goals of this article to
show that by expressing each of these tasks in terms of simple matrix or
element-wise operations and maintaining persistent objects in GPU memory, the
computational time can be drastically reduced. By using GPU objects to perform
the entire HMC simulation, most of the latency penalties associated with
transferring data from main to GPU memory can be avoided. Thus, the proposed
computational framework is conceptually very simple, but also is general enough
to be applied to most problems that use HMC sampling. For clarity of
exposition, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated in the
high-dimensional setting on a standard statistical model - multinomial
regression. Using GPUs, analyses of data sets that were previously intractable
for fully Bayesian approaches due to the prohibitively high computational cost
are now feasible.

to use the whole input power. In our implementation the observed sky field is
divided into two halves along the meridian, and each half-field corresponds to
one of the two input ports of the MPI. In this way, each detector in the FTS
focal planes measures the difference in brightness between two sky pixels,
symmetrically located with respect to the meridian. Exploiting the high
common-mode rejection of the MPI, we can measure low sky brightness gradients
over a high isotropic background. The instrument works in the range $\sim$
1$-$20 cm$^{-1}$ (30$-$600 GHz), has a maximum spectral resolution $1/(2 \ OPD)

well as a room-temperature unit working at the focus of suborbital and

that the quantitative distribution of the DNA codons ordered as a
rank-frequency plot follows a well-known power law called Zipf's law. Others
have shown that the DNA codon distribution is best fitted to an exponential
function. However, the reason for such scaling behavior has not yet been
addressed. In the present study, we demonstrate that the nonlinearity of the
DNA codon distribution is a direct consequence of the frequency recurrence of
the codon usage (i.e., the repetitiveness of codon usage frequencies at the
whole genome level). We discover that if frequency recurrence is absent from
the human genome, the frequency of occurrence of codons scales linearly with
the codon rank. We also show that DNA codons of both low and high frequency of
occurrence in the genome are best fitted by an exponential function and provide
strong evidence to suggest that the coding region of the human genome does not
follow Zipf's law. Information-theoretic methods and entropy calculations are
applied to the DNA codon distribution and a new approach, called the lariat
method, is proposed to quantitatively analyze the DNA codon distribution in
Homo sapiens.

reviews the conditions required for the pressure as a function of baryon

sufficiently stiff equations of state are evaluated. The common starting point
is a realistic description of both nuclear and neutron matter based on a chiral
effective field theory approach to the nuclear many-body problem. Possible
forms of hybrid matter featuring a quark core in the center of the star are
discussed using a three-flavor Polyakov--Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. It
is found that a conventional equation of state based on nuclear chiral dynamics
meets the astrophysical constraints. Hybrid matter generally turns out to be
too soft unless additional strongly repulsive correlations, e.g. through vector
current interactions between quarks, are introduced. The extent to which
strangeness can accumulate in the equation of state is also discussed.

intrinsic case one can also compute the correct currents by applying the bare
velocity operator to the ISO wavefunctions or alternatively the ISO group
velocity operator to the free wavefunctions. Charge currents for both SO
couplings are maximal in the vicinity of half integer flux quanta. Such maximal
currents are protected from thermal effects because contributing levels plunge
($\sim$1K) into the Fermi sea at half integer flux values. Such a mechanism,
makes them observable at readily accessible temperatures. Spin currents only
arise for the Rashba coupling, due to the spin symmetry of the ISO spectrum.
For the Rashba coupling, spin currents are cancelled at half integer fluxes but
they remain finite in the vicinity, and the same scenario above protects spin
currents.

sensing. First, we consider basic and statistical SSDF attacks, where the
malicious users attack independently. Then we propose a new SSDF attack, which
involves cooperation among malicious users by masking. In practice, the number
of malicious users is unknown. Thus, it is necessary to estimate the number of
malicious users, which is found using clustering and largest gap method.

for both the single processor and multi-processor cases. Energy conservation
has become a major concern, so revisiting traditional scheduling problems to
take into account the energy consumption has been part of the agenda of the
scheduling community for the past few years.
  We consider the energy minimizing speed scaling problem introduced by Yao et
al. where we wish to schedule a set of jobs, each with a release date, deadline
and work volume, on a set of identical processors. The processors may change
speed as a function of time and the energy they consume is the $\alpha$th power
of its speed. The objective is then to find a feasible schedule which minimizes
the total energy used.
  We show that in the setting with an arbitrary number of processors where all
work volumes are equal, there is a $2(1+\varepsilon)(5(1+\varepsilon))^{\alpha
-1}\tilde{B}_{\alpha}=O_{\alpha}(1)$ approximation algorithm, where
$\tilde{B}_{\alpha}$ is the generalized Bell number. This is the first constant
factor algorithm for this problem. This algorithm extends to general unequal
processor-dependent work volumes, up to losing a factor of
$(\frac{(1+r)r}{2})^{\alpha}$ in the approximation, where $r$ is the maximum
ratio between two work volumes. We then show this latter problem is APX-hard,
even in the special case when all release dates and deadlines are equal and $r$
is 4.
  In the single processor case, we introduce a new linear programming
formulation of speed scaling and prove that its integrality gap is at most
$12^{\alpha -1}$. As a corollary, we obtain a $(12(1+\varepsilon))^{\alpha -1}$
approximation algorithm where there is a single processor, improving on the
previous best bound of $2^{\alpha-1}(1+\varepsilon)^{\alpha}\tilde{B}_{\alpha}$
when $\alpha \ge 25$.

that is Poynting flux dominated. Due to the enormous magnetic energy density,
relativistic electrons will cool in such a region extremely rapidly via
synchrotron. As there is no known mechanism that can compete with synchrotron
it must be the source of the prompt sub-MeV emission. This sets strong limits
on the size and Lorentz factor of the outflow. Furthermore, synchrotron cooling
is too efficient. It overproduces optical and X-ray as compared with the
observations. This overproduction of low energy emission can be avoided if the
electrons are re-accelerated many times ($\gtrsim 5\times 10^4$)during each
pulse (or are continuously heated) or if they escape the emitting region before
cooling down. We explore the limitations of both models practically ruling out
the later and demonstrating that the former requires two different acceleration
mechanisms as well as an extremely large magnetic energy to Baryonic energy
ratio. To be viable, any GRB model based on an emission region that is Poynting
flux dominated must demonstrate how these conditions are met. We conclude that
if GRB jets are launched magnetically dominated they must dissipate somehow
most of their magnetic energy before they reach the emission region.

M-dwarfs in two public surveys, the CANDELS and the ERS mosaics, we identify a
morphological selection criterion using the half-light radius (r50), a
near-infrared J-H, G-J color region where M-dwarfs are found, and a V-J
relation with M-dwarf subtype. We apply this morphological selection of stellar
objects, color-color selection of M-dwarfs and optical-near-infrared color
subtyping to compile a catalog of 274 M-dwarfs belonging to the disk of the
Milky Way with a limiting magnitude of m_F125W < 24.
  Based on the M-dwarfs statistics, we conclude that (a) the previously
identified North/South discrepancy in M-dwarf numbers persists in our sample;
there are more M-dwarfs in the Northern fields on average than in Southern
ones, (b) the Milky Way's single disk scale-height for M-dwarfs is 0.3-4 kpc,
depending on sub-type, (c) {\bf ERRATUM:} we present corrected coordinates
(AstroPy) and distances and find a constant $z_0$=600 pc for all types. (d) a
second component is visible in the vertical distribution, with a different,
much higher scale-height. We report the M-dwarf component of the Sagittarius
stream in one of our fields with 11 confirmed M-dwarfs, 7 of which are at the
stream's distance.
  The dwarf scale-height and the relative low incidence in our fields of L- and
T-dwarfs in these fields makes it unlikely that these stars will be interlopers
in great numbers in color-selected samples of high-redshift galaxies. The
relative ubiquity of M-dwarfs however will make them ideal tracers of Galactic
Halo substructure with EUCLID and reference stars for JWST observations.

assuming theoretically motivated priors on the clumping factor and the photon
escape fraction we show that the UV LF from galaxy samples down to $M=-17.7$

studies, we can consistently compare the properties of the local cluster
population to those of their more distant counterparts. We describe a method we
have developed to automatically measure the equivalent width of spectral lines
in a robust way even in spectra with a non optimal signal to noise. Like this,
we can derive a spectral classification reflecting the stellar content, based
on the presence and strength of the [OII] and Hdelta lines. We are able to
measure 4381 of the ~6000 originally observed spectra, in the fields of 48
clusters, 2744 of which are spectroscopically confirmed cluster members. The
spectral classification is then analyzed as a function of galaxies' luminosity,
stellar mass, morphology, local density and host cluster's global properties,
and compared to higher redshift samples (MORPHS and EDisCS). The vast majority
of galaxies in the local clusters population are passive objects, being also
the most luminous and massive. At a magnitude limit of Mv<-18, galaxies in a
post-starburst phase represent only ~11% of the cluster population and this
fraction is reduced to ~5% at Mv<-19.5, which compares to the 18% at the same
magnitude limit for high-z clusters. ""Normal"" star forming galaxies [e( c )]
are proportionally more common in local clusters. The relative occurrence of
post--starbursts suggests a very similar quenching efficiency in clusters at
redshifts in the 0 to ~1 range. Furthermore, more important than the global
environment, the local density seems to be the main driver of galaxy evolution
in local clusters, at least with respect to their stellar populations content.

high column densities, and are therefore subject to three ""non-ideal""
magnetohydrodynamic effects: Ohmic dissipation, ambipolar diffusion, and the
Hall effect. The existence of magnetically driven turbulence in these discs has
been a central question since the discovery of the magnetorotational
instability. Early models considered Ohmic diffusion only and led to a scenario
of layered accretion, in which a magnetically ""dead"" zone in the disc midplane
is embedded within magnetically ""active"" surface layers at distances ~1-10 au
from the central protostellar object. Recent work has suggested that a
combination of Ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion can render both the
midplane and surface layers of the disc inactive and that torques due to
magnetically driven outflows are required to explain the observed accretion
rates. We reassess this picture by performing three-dimensional numerical
simulations that include, for the first time, all three non-ideal MHD effects.
We find that the Hall effect can generically ""revive"" dead zones by producing a
dominant azimuthal magnetic field and a large-scale Maxwell stress throughout
the midplane, provided the angular velocity and magnetic field satisfy Omega.B
> 0. The attendant large magnetic pressure modifies the vertical density
profile and substantially increases the disc scale height beyond its
hydrostatic value. Outflows are produced, but are not necessary to explain
accretion rates <10^{-7} Msun/yr. The flow in the disc midplane is essentially
laminar, suggesting that dust sedimentation may be efficient. These results
demonstrate that, if the MRI is relevant for driving mass accretion in
protoplanetary discs, one must include the Hall effect to obtain even
qualitatively correct results.

decomposition of galaxies in deep Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope $u,g,i$
imaging using GALFIT. Rigorous filtering is applied to identify an analysis
sample of 200 galaxies which are well described by an `archetypal' S0 structure
(central bulge + outer disc). We consider internal bulge and/or disc colour
gradients by allowing component sizes to vary between bands. Gradients are
required for $30\%$ of analysis sample galaxies. Bulge half-light radii are
found to be uncorrelated with galaxy luminosity ($R_e \sim 1$ kpc, $n\sim2$)
for all but the brightest galaxies ($M_g<-20.5$). The S0 discs are brighter (at
fixed size, or smaller at fixed luminosity) than those of star-forming spirals.
A similar colour-magnitude relation is found for both bulges and discs. The
global red sequence for S0s in Coma hence results from a combination of both
component trends. We measure an average bulge $-$ disc colour difference of
$0.09\pm0.01$ mag in $g-i$, and $0.16\pm0.01$ mag in $u-g$. Using simple
stellar population models, bulges are either $\sim2$-$3\times$ older, or
$\sim2\times$ more metal-rich than discs. The trend towards bluer global S0
colours observed further from Coma's core is driven by a significant
correlation in disc colour with cluster-centric radius. An equivalent trend is
detected in bulge colours at a marginal significance level. Our results
therefore favour environment-mediated mechanisms of disc fading as the dominant

shown that the presence of X-ray selected AGN in rich galaxy clusters is
suppressed. In the current study we investigate the occurrence of X-ray
selected AGN in low and moderate X-ray luminosity galaxy clusters. Due to the
wide contiguous XMM-LSS survey area we are able to extend the study to the
cluster outskirts. We therefore determine the projected overdensity of X-ray
point-like sources out to 6r_{500} radius. To provide robust statistical
results we also use a stacking analysis of the cluster projected overdensities.
We investigate whether the observed X-ray overdensities are to be expected by
estimating also the corresponding optical galaxy overdensities. We find a
positive X-ray projected overdensity at the first radial bin, which is however
of the same amplitude as that of optical galaxies. Therefore, no suppression of
X-ray AGN activity with respect to the field is found, implying that the
mechanisms responsible for the suppression are not so effective in lower
density environments. After a drop to roughly the background level between 2
and 3r_{500}, the X-ray overdensity exhibits a rise at larger radii,
significantly larger than the corresponding optical overdensity. Finally, using
redshift information of all optical counterparts, we derive the spatial
overdensity profile of the clusters. We find that the agreement between X-ray
and optical overdensities in the first radial bin is also suggested in the
3-dimensional analysis. However, we argue that the X-ray overdensity ""bump"" at
larger radial distance is probably a result of flux boosting by gravitational
lensing of background QSOs. For high redshift clusters an enhancement of X-ray
AGN activity in their outskirts is still possible.

chemical and energetic feedback play a major role in the gas dynamics, star
formation and therefore in the overall stellar evolution. The progenitor models
for the SNIa available in the literature propose different distributions for
regulating the explosion times of these events. These functions are known as
the Delay Time Distributions (DTDs). This work is the first one in a series of
papers aiming at studying five different DTDs for SNIa. Here, we implement and
analyse the Single Degenerate scenario (SD) in galaxies dominated by a rapid
quenching of the star formation, displaying the majority of the stars
concentrated in the bulge component. We find a good fit to both the present
observed SNIa rates in spheroidal dominated galaxies, and to the [O/Fe] ratios
shown by the bulge of the Milky Way. Additionally, the SD scenario is found to
reproduce a correlation between the specific SNIa rate and the specific star
formation rate, which closely resembles the observational trend, at variance
with previous works. Our results suggest that SNIa observations in galaxies
with very low and very high specific star formation rates can help to impose
more stringent constraints on the DTDs and therefore on SNIa progenitors.

$10\,$M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, and the other half (i.e. 27 per cent of the sample)

examining the position of the BGGs/BCGs with respect to their host dark matter

Poynting flux dominated outflows. We explore here the propagation of such a jet

dissipation at the head of this shock supplies energy to a cocoon that

While this description resembles the propagation of a hydrodynamic jets there
are significant qualitative differences. Two Strong shocks, the reverse shock
that slows down the hydrodynamic jet and the collimation shock that collimates
it, cannot form within the Poynting flux dominated jet. As a result this jet
moves much faster and dissipates much less energy while it crosses the stellar

variables with $N := \#\{j \geq 1: T_j \not = 0\} < \infty$ almost surely,
there is an associated smoothing transformation which maps a distribution $P$
on $\mathbb{R}^d$ to the distribution of $\sum_{j \geq 1} T_j \mathbf{X}^{(j)}

independent of $(C_1,\ldots,C_d,T_1,T_2,\ldots)$. We are interested in the
fixed points of this mapping. By improving on the techniques developed in [G.

below the rest-frame Lyman limit ($\lambda_\mathrm{r}<912$\AA) to assess the

HI-ionizing radiation. At mean redshifts $z_\mathrm{q}=4.56$, 4.86 and 5.16, we

1.6)h_{70}^{-1}$ proper Mpc with uncertainties dominated by sample variance.
Combining our results with $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$ measurements from lower
redshifts, the data are well modelled by a simple power-law
$\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}=A[(1+z)/5]^\eta$ with $A=(37\pm 2)h_{70}^{-1}$ Mpc
and $\eta = -5.4\pm 0.4$ between $z=2.3$ and $z=5.5$. This rapid evolution
requires a physical mechanism -- beyond cosmological expansion -- which reduces
the cosmic effective Lyman limit opacity. We speculate that the majority of HI
Lyman limit opacity manifests in gas outside galactic dark matter haloes,
tracing large-scale structures (e.g. filaments) whose average density (and
consequently neutral fraction) decreases with cosmic time. Our measurements of
the strongly redshift-dependent mean free path shortly after the completion of
HI reionization serve as a valuable boundary condition for numerical models
thereof. Having measured $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}\approx 10$ Mpc at $z=5.2$,
we confirm that the intergalactic medium is highly ionized by that epoch and
that the redshift evolution of the mean free path does not show a break that
would indicate a recent end to HI reionization.

time-dependent magnetic fields generated inside an array of solenoid coils are
used to manipulate the velocity of a supersonic beam. A 12-stage Zeeman
decelerator has been built and characterized using hydrogen atoms as a test
system. The instrument has several original features including the possibility
to replace each deceleration coil individually. In this article, we give a
detailed description of the experimental setup, and illustrate its performance.
We demonstrate that the overall acceptance in a Zeeman decelerator can be
significantly increased with only minor changes to the setup itself. This is
achieved by applying a rather low, anti-parallel magnetic field in one of the
solenoid coils that forms a temporally varying quadrupole field, and improves
particle confinement in the transverse direction. The results are reproduced by
three-dimensional numerical particle trajectory simulations thus allowing for a
rigorous analysis of the experimental data. The findings suggest the use of a
modified coil configuration to improve transverse focusing during the
deceleration process.

(CDG) gas-kinetic BGK method for the Navier-Stokes equations. The proposed
method is based on the CDG method defined on two sets of overlapping meshes to
avoid discontinuous solutions at cell interfaces, as well as the gas-kinetic
BGK model to evaluate fluxes for both convection and diffusion terms. Redundant
representation of the numerical solution in the CDG method offers great
convenience in the design of gas-kinetic BGK fluxes. Specifically, the
evaluation of fluxes at cell interfaces of one set of computational mesh is
right inside the cells of the staggered mesh, hence the corresponding particle
distribution function for flux evaluation is much simpler than that in existing
gas-kinetic BGK methods. As a central scheme, the proposed CDG-BGK has doubled
the memory requirement as the corresponding DG scheme; on the other hand, {for
the convection part,} the CFL time step constraint of the CDG method for
numerical stability is relatively large compared with that for the DG method.
Numerical boundary conditions have to be treated with special care. Numerical
examples for 1D and 2D viscous flow simulations are presented to validate the
accuracy and robustness of the proposed RK CDG-BGK method.

precisely, noninteracting test particles. We compute the mass and angular

produces the resonance and permits an analytic description of its structure. We
derive an analytic expression for the buoyancy torque and show that the
vertical torque distribution agrees well with results of Athena simulations and
a Fourier method for linear numerical calculations carried out with the same
forcing. The buoyancy resonance differs from the classic Lindblad and
corotation resonances in that the resonance lies along tilted planes. Its width
depends on damping effects and is independent of the gas sound speed. The
resonance does not excite propagating waves. At a given large azimuthal
wavenumber k_y > 1/h (for disk thickness h), the buoyancy resonance exerts a
torque over a region that lies radially closer to the corotation radius than
the Lindblad resonance. Because the torque is localized to the region of
excitation, it is potentially subject to the effects of nonlinear saturation.
In addition, the torque can be reduced by the effects of radiative heat
transfer between the resonant region and its surroundings. For each azimuthal
wavenumber, the resonance establishes a large scale density wave pattern in a
plane within the disk.

an exceptional number of strongly lensed multiply-imaged galaxies, including
high-redshift candidates. Previous studies have used this data to obtain the
most detailed dark matter reconstructions of any galaxy cluster to date,
resolving substructures ~25 kpc across. We examine Abell 1689 (hereafter,
A1689) non-parametrically, combining strongly lensed images and weak
distortions from wider field Subaru imaging, and we incorporate member galaxies
to improve the lens solution. Strongly lensed galaxies are often locally
affected by member galaxies, however, these perturbations cannot be recovered
in grid based reconstructions because the lensing information is too sparse to
resolve member galaxies. By adding luminosity-scaled member galaxy deflections
to our smooth grid we can derive meaningful solutions with sufficient accuracy
to permit the identification of our own strongly lensed images, so our model
becomes self consistent. We identify 11 new multiply lensed system candidates
and clarify previously ambiguous cases, in the deepest optical and NIR data to
date from Hubble and Subaru. Our improved spatial resolution brings up new
features not seen when the weak and strong lensing effects are used separately,
including clumps and filamentary dark matter around the main halo. Our
treatment means we can obtain an objective mass ratio between the cluster and
galaxy components, for examining the extent of tidal stripping of the luminous
member galaxies. We find a typical mass-to-light ratios of M/L_B = 21 inside
the r<1 arcminute region that drops to M/L_B = 17 inside the r<40 arcsecond
region. Our model independence means we can objectively evaluate the
competitiveness of stacking cluster lenses for defining the geometric
lensing-distance-redshift relation in a model independent way.

the observed strengths of all nodes is crucial in order to either detect
interesting deviations of an empirical network from economically meaningful

the latter is unknown. However, several studies have proved that real economic

World Trade Multiplex by comparing it to an enhanced null model that
simultaneously reproduces the strength and the degree of each node. We study
several temporal snapshots and almost one hundred layers (commodity classes) of
the multiplex and find that the observed properties are systematically well
reproduced by our model. Our formalism allows us to introduce the (static)
concept of extensive and intensive bias, defined as a measurable tendency of
the network to prefer either the formation of extra links or the reinforcement
of link weights, with respect to a reference case where only strengths are
enforced. Our findings complement the existing economic literature on (dynamic)
intensive and extensive trade margins. More in general, they show that
real-world multiplexes can be strongly shaped by layer-specific local

analog of the standard catenoid $|x_3| = \log (r + \sqrt{r^2 -1})$. Rather than
eventual logarithmic growth, this surface becomes asymptotic to the cone

actual response of the bridge systems, especially beyond the elastic limit of
their behavior, and correlating the impact of damage to the overall system
behavior. In practice, most of the in-service bridge superstructures behave
elastically under the routine daily traffic; however, existing damage and
deteriorating conditions would significantly influence different aspects of the
structural performance including reserve capacity, resilience and remaining
service-life. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the response of
composite steel girder bridges under the effect of subsurface delamination in
the reinforced concrete deck. Commercial finite element computer software,
ANSYS, was implemented to perform a nonlinear analysis on a representative
single-span simply supported bridge superstructure. The system failure
characteristics were captured in the numerical models by incorporating
different sources of material non-linearities including cracking/crushing in
the concrete and plasticity in steel components. Upon validation, non-linear
behavior of the system with both intact and degraded configurations was used to
evaluate the impact of integrated damage mechanism on the overall system
performance. Reserve capacity of this bridge superstructure was also determined
with respect to the nominal element-level design capacity. As vision to the
future path, this framework can be implemented to evaluate the performance of
other in-service bridges degraded under the effect of different damage
scenarios, thus providing a mechanism to determine a measure of capacity,

all its traffic. The goal is to minimize the cost of routing the traffic in the

relaxation formulation introduced in Ernst and Krishnamoorthy (1996, 1999) by
incorporating a set of validity constraints. Then, after obtaining a fractional
solution to the LP relaxation, we make use of a geometric rounding algorithm to
obtain an integral solution. We show that by incorporating the validity
constraints, the strengthened LP often provides much tighter upper bounds than
the previous methods with a little more computational effort, and the solution
obtained often has a much smaller gap with the optimal solution. We also
formulate a robust version of the FHSAP and show that it can guard against data

Although it is a difficult theoretical question which has not reached a
complete consensus yet, a general agreement now is that there are at least two
physically inequivalent gauge-invariant decompositions (I) and (II) of the
nucleon. %The one is a nontrivial gauge-invariant %generalization of the
Jaffe-Manohar decomposition. %The other is an extension of the Ji
decomposition, which allows %a gauge-invariant decomposition of the total gluon
angular %momentum into the intrinsic spin and orbital parts. In these two
decompositions, the intrinsic spin parts of quarks and gluons are just common.
What discriminate these two decompositions are the orbital angular momentum
parts. The orbital angular momenta of quarks and gluons appearing in the
decomposition (I) are the so-called ""mechanical"" orbital angular momenta, while
those appearing in the decomposition (II) are the generalized (gauge-invariant)
""canonical"" ones. By this reason, these decompositions are also called the
""mechanical"" and ""canonical"" decompositions of the nucleon spin, respectively.
A crucially important question is which decomposition is more favorable from
the observational viewpoint. The main objective of this concise review is to
try to answer this question with careful consideration of recent intensive
researches on this problem.

strategic interactions. Much of this work seeks to understand how the realized
equilibrium of a game is influenced by uncertainty in the environment and the
information available to players in the game. Lurking beneath this literature
is a fundamental, yet largely unexplored, algorithmic question: how should a
""market maker"" who is privy to additional information, and equipped with a
specified objective, inform the players in the game? This is an informational
analogue of the mechanism design question, and views the information structure
of a game as a mathematical object to be designed, rather than an exogenous
variable.
  We initiate a complexity-theoretic examination of the design of optimal
information structures in general Bayesian games, a task often referred to as
signaling. We focus on one of the simplest instantiations of the signaling
question: Bayesian zero-sum games, and a principal who must choose an
information structure maximizing the equilibrium payoff of one of the players.
In this setting, we show that optimal signaling is computationally intractable,
and in some cases hard to approximate, assuming that it is hard to recover a
planted clique from an Erdos-Renyi random graph. This is despite the fact that
equilibria in these games are computable in polynomial time, and therefore
suggests that the hardness of optimal signaling is a distinct phenomenon from
the hardness of equilibrium computation. Necessitated by the non-local nature
of information structures, en-route to our results we prove an ""amplification
lemma"" for the planted clique problem which may be of independent interest.

ratio of quadratic functions subject to a two-sided quadratic constraint. As is
well-known, the fractional objective function can be replaced by a parametric
family of quadratic functions, which makes (P) highly related to, but more
difficult than a single quadratic programming problem subject to a similar
constraint set. The task is to find the optimal parameter $\lambda^*$ and then
look for the optimal solution if $\lambda^*$ is attained. Contrasted with the
classical Dinkelbach method that iterates over the parameter, we propose a
suitable constraint qualification under which a new version of the S-lemma with
an equality can be proved so as to compute $\lambda^*$ directly via an exact
SDP relaxation. When the constraint set of (P) is degenerated to become an
one-sided inequality, the same SDP approach can be applied to solve (P) {\it
without any condition}. We observe that the difference between a two-sided
problem and an one-sided problem lies in the fact that the S-lemma with an
equality does not have a natural Slater point to hold, which makes the former
essentially more difficult than the latter. This work does not, either, assume
the existence of a positive-definite linear combination of the quadratic terms
(also known as the dual Slater condition, or a positive-definite matrix
pencil), our result thus provides a novel extension to the so-called ""hard

product of angular rotation velocity of the field and the Berry curvature. (2)
We re-examine the Landau--Zener transition for a system coupled to environment
at arbitrary temperature. We show that as temperature increases, the thermal
excitation and relaxation become leading processes responsible for transition
between states of the system. We also apply the Lindblad master equations to
these two problems and compare results with those obtained from the
Bloch--Redfield equations.

this study attempts to explore gender differences in the adoption of mobile
learning, by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with general and
specific CSE. Data collected from 137 university students were tested against
the research model using the structural equation modeling approach. The results
suggest that there are significant gender differences in perceptions of general
CSE, perceived ease of use and behavioral intention to use but no significant
differences in specific CSE, perceived usefulness. Additionally, the findings
reveal that specific CSE is more salient than general CSE in influencing
perceived ease of use while general CSE seems to be the salient factor on
perceived usefulness for both female and male combined. Moreover, general CSE
was salient to determine the behavioral intention to use indirectly for female
despite lower perception of general CSE than male's, and specific CSE exhibited
stronger indirect effect on behavioral intention to use than general CSE for
female despite similar perception of specific CSE as males'. These findings
provide important implications for mobile learning adoption and usage.

computationally studied from a time dependent viewpoint. Motivation for such
studies lies in coherent pulsed laser experiments that explore the
isomerization dynamics. However, such biological processes take place naturally
in the presence of incoherent light, which excites a non-evolving mixture of
stationary states. Here the isomerization problem is considered from the latter
viewpoint and applied to a standard two-state, two-mode linear vibronic
coupling model of retinal that explicitly includes a conical intersection
between the ground and first excited electronic states. The calculated quantum
yield at 500 nm agrees well with both the previous time-dependent calculations
of Hahn and Stock (0.63) and with experiment ($0.65\pm0.01$), as does its
wavelength dependence. Significantly, the effects of environmental relaxation
on the quantum yield in this well-established model are found to be negligible.
The results make clear the connection of the photoisomerization quantum yield
to properties of stationary eigenstates, providing alternate insights into
conditions for yield optimization.

and other nonlinear physical systems. In this paper we offer a general
statistical model which attributes the observed $K = aS^2 + b$ relation to the
varying intermittency of the experimental signals. The model is a two random
variable model constructed to catch the essential intermittent feature of the
real signal. One of the variables is the amplitude of the underlying
intermittent event (e.g. turbulent structure) while the other is connected to
the intermittency level of the system. This simple model can attribute physical
meaning to the $a$ and $b$ coefficients, as they characterize the
spatio-temporal statistics of intermittent events. By constructing a
particle-conserving Gaussian model for the underlying coherent structures the
experimentally measured $a$ and $b$ coefficients could be adequately
reproduced.

However, the high density of active (""on"") APs results in severe interference

converted to an equivalent DL problem in C-RAN with two inter-related

separating independent source signals from their linear mixtures. ICA has been
widely applied in neuroimaging studies to identify and characterize underlying

effects of subjects' clinical and demographic covariates on the spatial
distributions of the functional networks. Currently, covariate effects are not
incorporated in existing group ICA decomposition methods. Hence, they can only
be evaluated through ad-hoc approaches which may not be accurate in many cases.
In this paper, we propose a hierarchical covariate ICA model that provides a
formal statistical framework for estimating and testing covariate effects in
ICA decomposition. A maximum likelihood method is proposed for estimating the
covariate ICA model. We develop two expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms to
obtain maximum likelihood estimates. The first is an exact EM algorithm, which
has analytically tractable E-step and M-step. Additionally, we propose a
subspace-based approximate EM, which can significantly reduce computational
time while still retain high model-fitting accuracy. Furthermore, to test
covariate effects on the functional networks, we develop a voxel-wise
approximate inference procedure which eliminates the needs of computationally
expensive covariance estimation. The performance of the proposed methods is
evaluated via simulation studies. The application is illustrated through an
fMRI study of Zen meditation.

higher error correction capabilities compared to others. We propose an approach

particular, the chemo-dynamical distribution functions for low-mass stars
(e.g., G- or K-type dwarfs) are precious tracers of the earliest stages of the
Milky Way's formation, since their main-sequence lifetimes approach or exceed
the age of the universe. A basic tenet of essentially all previous analyses is
that the stellar metallicity, usually parametrized as [Fe/H], is conserved over
time for main-sequence stars (at least those that have not been polluted due to
mass transfer from binary companions). If this holds true, any correlations
between metallicity and kinematics for long-lived main-sequence stars of
different masses, effective temperatures, or spectral types must strictly be
the same, since they reflect the same mass-assembly and star-formation
histories. By analyzing a sample of nearby metal-poor halo and thick-disk stars

is a localized transverse displacement of the tube that excites a fast kink

expression containing an integral that is computed numerically. We find that
the dispersion of fast kink wave trains is more important for shorter initial
disturbances (i.e. more concentrated in the longitudinal direction) and for
larger density ratios (i.e. for larger contrasts of the tube density with
respect to the environment density). This type of excitation generates a wave
train whose signature at a fixed position along a coronal loop is a short event
(duration ~ 20 s) in which the velocity and density oscillate very rapidly with
typical periods of the order of a few seconds. The oscillatory period is not
constant but gradually declines during the course of this event. Peak values of
the velocity are of the order of 10 km/s and are accompanied by maximum density
variations of the order of 10-15% the unperturbed loop density.

Here we give an introduction to the flavour problem and to discrete groups

applied external perturbations, and thus provides a simple threshold estimate.
We apply our method to different configurations in the VKS experiment showing
that it yields a robust indication of the dynamo threshold as well as evidence

a dynamo transition is not observed, the method provides a way to extrapolate

the presence of Fe3+. Our simulations predict a dissociation constant of
2.2$\pm$0.2 mM which is in remarkable agreement with the experimentally
measured value of 2.3$\pm$0.3 mM under the same ionization strength and pH
conditions. We apply perturbations relevant for changes in environmental
conditions as (i) different values of ionic strength (IS), and (ii) protonation
of a group of residues to mimic a different pH environment. Local perturbations
are also studied by protonation or mutation of a site distal to the binding
region that is known to mechanically manipulate the hinge-like motions of FbpA.
We find that while the average conformation of the protein is intact in all
simulations, the H2PO4- dynamics may be substantially altered by the changing
conditions. In particular, the bound fraction which is 20$\%$ for the wild type
system is increased to 50$\%$ with a D52A mutation/protonation and further to
over 90$\%$ at the protonation conditions mimicking those at pH 5.5. The change
in the dynamics is traced to the altered electrostatic distribution on the
surface of the protein which in turn affects hydrogen bonding patterns at the
active site. The observations are quantified by rigorous free energy
calculations. Our results lend clues as to how the environment versus single
residue perturbations may be utilized for regulation of binding modes in hFbpA
systems in the absence of conformational changes.

donors in silicon can be very effective in a magnetic field of 4.6 T and at
temperatures below 1 K. The DNP occurs due to the Overhauser effect following a
cross relaxation via the forbidden flip-flop or flip-flip transitions. Nuclear
polarization values $P>0.98$ were reached after 20 min of pumping with 0.4
$\mu$W of microwave power. We evaluated that the ratio of hyperfine state
populations increased by three orders of magnitude after 2 hours of pumping,
and an extremely pure nuclear spin system containing $<10^{-11}$ of the other
spin state can be created. An inverted DNP has been obtained by pumping the low
field ESR line of P followed by the flip-flip cross relaxation. This transition
has much smaller relaxation rate and required substantially longer pumping
times. We found that the nuclear polarization dynamics deviates substantially
from a simple exponential function. The evolution of the polarization is
characterized by two time constants $T^{'}_{ac}\approx$15 s in the beginning,
and $T^{""}_{ac}\approx$1100 s for long pumping time. Temperature dependence of
the nuclear relaxation rate of $^{31}$P was studied down to 0.75 K, below which
the relaxation time became too long to be measured. The nuclear polarization
followed a bi-exponential time dependence during relaxation. We suggest that
the non-exponential behavior of DNP dynamics and the subsequent relaxation is
mediated by the nuclei of $^{29}$Si surrounding $^{31}$P donors, which affect
the transition probabilities of the forbidden cross-relaxation processes.

We are able to detect the host galaxy for more than 3/4 of the whole dataset
and characterise the properties of their hosts. We found that QSO hosts are
dominated by luminous galaxies of absolute magnitude M*-3 < M(R) < M*. For the
unresolved objects we computed a upper limit to the host luminosity. For each
well resolved quasar we are also able to characterise the morphology of the
host galaxy that turn out to be more complex than what found in previous
studies. QSO are hosted in a variety of galaxies from pure ellipticals to
complex/composite morphologies that combine spheroids, disk, lens and halo. The
black hole mass of the quasar, estimated from the spectral properties of the
nuclei, are poorly correlated with the total luminosity of the host galaxy.
However, taking into account only the bulge component we found a significant

a nonparametric representation, analytic marginal and predictive distributions,

flexibility, and predictive covariances that, unlike a Gaussian process,
explicitly depend on the values of training observations. We verify empirically
that a Student-t process is especially useful in situations where there are

constrained by the upper limit on the radio flux from the region around MGRO

explain the observed TeV flux from MGRO J2019+37 without violating the GMRT

respectively, the emission region must be extremely compact with the
characteristic size of the emission region restricted to $\lsim{\mathcal

is at least four orders of magnitude less than the characteristic size of the

node in ORDSSes is under consideration and a tight lower bound on the repair
bandwidth is obtained. In particular, we indicate the fact that for any ORDSS,
every storage node can be repaired with repair bandwidth achieving the lower

have $D^{A\to B}(f)\leq O(Q^{A\to B,*}(f)\cdot m)$. This bound was previously

classical proofs. We give the first example of a scenario, where quantum proofs
lead to exponential savings in computing a Boolean function. The previously

behaviors, which are in part regulated by mechanical and biochemical
interactions between cells. Quantification of force and stress is therefore
necessary to analyze the mechanisms controlling tissue morphogenesis. Recently,
a mechanical measurement method based on force inference from cell shapes and
connectivity has been developed. It is non-invasive, and can provide space-time
maps of force and stress within an epithelial tissue, up to prefactors. We
previously performed a comparative study of three force-inference methods,
which differ in their approach of treating indefiniteness in an inverse problem
between cell shapes and forces. In the present study, to further validate and
compare the three force inference methods, we tested their robustness by
measuring temporal fluctuation of estimated forces. Quantitative data of
cell-level dynamics in a developing tissue suggests that variation of forces
and stress will remain small within a short period of time ($\sim$minutes).
Here, we showed that cell-junction tensions and global stress inferred by the
Bayesian force inference method varied less with time than those inferred by
the method that estimates only tension. In contrast, the amplitude of temporal
fluctuations of estimated cell pressures differs less between different
methods. Altogether, the present study strengthens the validity and robustness
of the Bayesian force-inference method.

avoids the undesirable characteristic appearing in the known measure of MIN

trivial local reversible operations on the unmeasured party. We obtain

correlation measures, the new defined MIN can be directly applied to various

governs the overall behavior of a network. Profiling this meso--scale structure
currently relies on a limited number of methods which are often complex, and
have scalability issues when dealing with very large networks. As a result, we
are yet to fully understand its impact on network properties and dynamics. Here
we introduce a simple method to profile this structure by combining the
concepts of core/periphery and rich-club. The key challenge in addressing such
association of the two concepts is to establish a way to define the membership
of the core. The notion of a ""rich-club"" describes nodes which are essentially
the hub of a network, as they play a dominating role in structural and
functional properties. Interestingly, the definition of a rich-club naturally
emphasizes high degree nodes and divides a network into two subgroups. Our
approach theoretically couples the underlying principle of a rich-club with the
escape time of a random walker, and a rich-core is defined by examining changes
in the associated persistence probability. The method is fast and scalable to
large networks. In particular, we successfully show that the evolution of the
core in \emph{C. elegans} and World Trade networks correspond to key
development stages and responses to historical events respectively.

dipoles and a moderate total number of particles. The classical normal mode
spectra support the chain interpretation both through structure and the
distinct degeneracies depending discretely on the number of dipoles per
revolution. A larger total number of dipoles leads to a clusterization where
the dipolar chains move closer to each other. This implies a change in the
local density and the emergence of two length scales, one for the cluster size
and one for the inter-cluster distance along the helix. Starting from three
dipoles per revolution, this implies a breaking of the initial periodicity to
form a cluster of two chains close together and a third chain removed from the
cluster. This is driven by the competition between in-chain and out-of-chain
interactions, or alternatively the side-by-side repulsion and the head-to-tail
attraction in the system. The speed of sound propagates along the chains. It is

the elementary excitations are ""half vortices"" in which there is a phase
rotation of $\pi$ in connection with a polarization vector rotation of $\pi$
around a closed path. This is clearly seen in the experimental observations of
the polarization rotation around the ring. In the ring geometry, a new type of
half vortex is allowed in which the handedness of the spin flips from one side
of the ring to the other, in addition to the rotation of the linear
polarization component; such a state is not allowed in a simply-connected
geometry. Theoretical calculation of the energy of this state shows that when
many-body interactions are taken into account, it is lower in energy than a
simple half vortex. The direction of circulation of the flow around the ring
fluctuates randomly between clockwise and counterclockwise from one shot to the
next; this corresponds to spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry in the
system. These new, macroscopic polariton ring condensates allow for the
possibility of direct control of the vorticity of the condensate.

due to truly different evolutionary responses, but it can be also due to the
low power of former studies that have mainly focused on populations from a

identify selection occurring at different scales, as well as convergent
adaptation in different regions. We apply our approach to the analysis of a

identify several candidate genome regions for altitudinal selection, and we

variety of forms, and can potentially give corrections to the standard picture
on typical scales of 100 Mpc. These corrections cannot be obtained by Newtonian
numerical simulations, so it is important to accurately estimate the magnitude
of these relativistic effects. Density fluctuations couple to produce a
background of gravitational waves, which is larger than any primordial
background. A similar interaction produces a much larger spectrum of vector
modes which represent the frame-dragging rotation of spacetime. These can
change the metric at the percent level in the concordance model at scales below
the equality scale. Vector modes modify the lensing of background galaxies by
large-scale structure. This gives in principle the exciting possibility of
measuring relativistic frame dragging effects on cosmological scales. The
effects of the non-linear tensor and vector modes on the cosmic convergence are
computed and compared to first-order lensing contributions from density
fluctuations, Doppler lensing, and smaller Sachs-Wolfe effects. The lensing
from gravitational waves is negligible so we concentrate on the vector modes.
We show the relative importance of this for future surveys such as Euclid and
SKA. We find that these non-linear effects only marginally affect the overall
weak lensing signal so they can safely be neglected in most analyses, though
are still much larger than the linear Sachs-Wolfe terms. The second-order
vector contribution can dominate the first-order Doppler lensing term at
moderate redshifts and are actually more important for survey geometries like
the SKA.

an example set of structured objects, to generate novel objects with similar

can be interpreted as a constraint satisfaction problem, i.e. the generated
objects must obey a set of soft constraints, whose weights are estimated from
the data. Traditional SRL approaches rely on (finite) First-Order Logic (FOL)

FOL is unsuited for con- structive problems where the objects contain a mixture
of Boolean and numerical variables. It is in fact difficult to implement, e.g.
linear arithmetic constraints within the language of FOL. In this paper we
propose a novel class of hybrid SRL methods that rely on Satisfiability Modulo
Theories, an alternative class of for- mal languages that allow to describe,
and reason over, mixed Boolean-numerical objects and constraints. The resulting
methods, which we call Learning Mod- ulo Theories, are formulated within the

dipole-dipole interaction and collective spontaneous decay which compromises
the ultimate frequency stability. In the high density limit the Dicke
superradiant linewidth enhancement will broaden the laser line and nearest
neighbor couplings will induce shifts and fluctuations of the laser frequency.
We estimate the magnitude and scaling of these effects by direct numerical
simulations of few atom systems for different geometries and densities. For
Strontium in a regularly filled magic wavelength configuration atomic
interactions induce small laser frequency shifts only and collective
spontaneous emission weakly broadens the laser. These interactions generally
enhance the laser sensitivity to cavity length fluctuations but for optimally

different crystalline domains with varying lattice parameters are found, and
three phases (orthorhombic, tetragonal, and collapsed tetragonal) coexist
between T$_{S}$ = 95 K and 45 K. Annealing of the quenched crystals at
350{\deg}C leads to a strain relief through a large (~1.3 %) expansion of the
c-parameter and a small (~0.2 %) contraction of the a-parameter, and to local
~0.2 {\AA} displacements at the atomic-level. This annealing procedure results
in the most homogeneous crystals for which the antiferromagnetic and
orthorhombic phase transitions occur at T$_{N}$/T$_{S}$ = 168(1) K. In the
700{\deg}C-annealed crystal, an intermediate strain regime takes place, with
tetragonal and orthorhombic structural phases coexisting between 80 to 120 K.
The origin of such strong shifts in the transition temperatures are tied to
structural parameters. Importantly, with annealing, an increase in the Fe-As
length leads to more localized Fe electrons and higher local magnetic moments
on Fe ions. Synergistic contribution of other structural parameters, including
a decrease in the Fe-Fe distance, and a dramatic increase of the c-parameter,
which enhances the Fermi surface nesting in CaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$, are also
discussed.

with bosonic excitations obeying a hard-core constraint. Such models can be
systematically derived by renormalization schemes such as continuous unitary
transformations or by variational approaches. Even in the absence of further
interactions the hard-core constraint makes the dynamics of the hard-core
bosons nontrivial. Here we develop a systematic diagrammatic approach to the
spectral properties of hard-core bosons at finite temperature. Starting from an
expansion in the density of thermally excited bosons in a system with an energy
gap, our approach leads to a summation of ladder diagrams. Conceptually, the
approach is not restricted to one dimension, but the one-dimensional case
offers the opportunity to gauge the method by comparison to exact results
obtained via a mapping to Jordan-Wigner fermions. In particular, we present
results for the thermal broadening of single-particle spectral functions at
finite temperature. The line-shape is found to be asymmetric at elevated
temperatures and the band-width of the dispersion narrows with increasing
temperature. Additionally, the total number of thermally excited bosons is
calculated and compared to various approximations and analytic results.

emitters allow for analyzing the role of the mode function in quantum optics.
In an earlier Young's double slit experiment using a higher spatial light mode
some possibly new aspects of complementarity were demonstrated. Here the
chances of using induced coherence in spontaneous down conversion (SPDC) are
experimentally investigated. SPDC in a nonlinear crystal generates two single
photons (signal and idler) with random, but conjugated phases. Thus no
interference between them occurs. But coherence can be induced between the two
separated crystals. Decreasing the pump intensity allows the generation of just
one photon pair from one of the crystals during one measuring interval,
resulting in 1st-order interference of single photons. Varying the phase delay
between the pump beams for the two crystals results in 1st-order single photon
interference but with a fringe period of about half of the photon wavelength.
This phase memory effect causes coherence across the two coupled
interferometers. And even for pump photon delays much larger than the coherence
length of the detected single photons the visibility is above 90 percent.
Therefore this phase memory is a useful tool for investigating the
wave-particle dualism in future experiments.

mechanical effects, such as winds and jets in driving explosions. In this paper
we study the typical time-scale and energy for accelerating gas by neutrinos in
core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and find that under the most extremely
favorable (and probably unrealistic) conditions, the energy of the ejected mass
can reach at most 5X10^50 erg. More typical conditions yield explosion energies
an order-of-magnitude below the observed 10^51 erg explosions. On the other
hand, non-spherical effects with directional outflows hold promise to reach the
desired explosion energy and beyond. Such directional outflows, which in some
simulations are produced by numerical effects of 2D grids, can be attained by
angular momentum and jet launching. Our results therefore call for a paradigm

escapes from the region -- this is the Zeno effect. The aim of this paper is to
show how the Zeno effect disappears in the classical limit in this and similar
examples. We give a general argument showing that the Zeno effect is suppressed
in the presence of a decoherence mechanism which kills interference between
histories. We show how this works explicitly by coupling to a decohering
environment. Smoothed projectors are required to give the problem proper
definition and this implies the existence of a momentum cutoff. We show that
the escape rate from the region approaches the classically expected result, and
hence the Zeno effect is suppressed, as long as the environmentally-induced
fluctuations in momentum are sufficiently large and we establish the associated
timescale. We link our results to earlier work on the hbar -->0 limit of the
Zeno effect. We illustrate our results by plotting the probability flux lines
for the density matrix (which are equivalent to Bohm trajectories in the pure
state case). These illustrate both the Zeno and anti-Zeno effects very clearly,
and their suppression. Our results are closely related to our earlier paper

accelerators, ultra-intense laser interactions are of particular interest as

predicts that isolated free relativistic electron sheets (FRES) can be produced
and exploited for the production of a new class of radiation - unipolar extreme
ultraviolet(XUV) pulses. However, the combination of extremely rapid rise-time
and highest peak intensity in these simulations is still beyond current laser
technology. We demonstrate a route to isolated FRES with existing lasers by
exploiting relativistic transparency to produce an ultra-intense pulse with a
steep rise time. When such an FRES interacts with a second, oblique target foil
the electron sheet is rapidly accelerated ('kicked'). The radiation signature
and simulations demonstrate that a single, nanometer thick FRES was produced.
The experimental observations together with our theoretical modeling suggest
the production of the first unipolar (half-cycle) pulse in the XUV - an
achievement that has so far only been realized in the terahertz spectral

Sci., 2 (2009), pp. 323-43] is a fast splitting-based algorithm that solves
image reconstruction problems with general l1, e.g., total-variation (TV) and
compressed sensing (CS), regularizations by introducing a single variable split
to decouple the data-fitting term and the regularization term, yielding simple
subproblems that are separable (or partially separable) and easy to minimize.
Several convergence proofs have been proposed, and these proofs either impose a
""full column rank"" assumption to the split or assume exact updates in all
subproblems. However, these assumptions are impractical in many applications
such as the X-ray computed tomography (CT) image reconstructions, where the
inner least-squares problem usually cannot be solved efficiently due to the
highly shift-variant Hessian. In this paper, we show that when the data-fitting
term is quadratic, the SB method is a convergent alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM), and a straightforward convergence proof with inexact
updates is given using [J. Eckstein and D. P. Bertsekas, Mathematical
Programming, 55 (1992), pp. 293-318, Theorem 8]. Furthermore, since the SB
method is just a special case of an ADMM algorithm, it seems likely that the
ADMM algorithm will be faster than the SB method if the augmented Largangian
(AL) penalty parameters are selected appropriately. To have a concrete example,
we conduct a convergence rate analysis of the ADMM algorithm using two splits
for image restoration problems with quadratic data-fitting term and
regularization term. According to our analysis, we can show that the two-split
ADMM algorithm can be faster than the SB method if the AL penalty parameter of
the SB method is suboptimal. Numerical experiments were conducted to verify our
analysis.

The emergence
of such an elaborated form of communication allowed humans to create extremely
structured societies and manage symbols at different levels including, among
others, semantics. All linguistic levels have to deal with an astronomic
combinatorial potential that stems from the recursive nature of languages. This
recursiveness is indeed a key defining trait. However, not all words are
equally combined nor frequent. In breaking the symmetry between less and more
often used and between less and more meaning-bearing units, universal scaling
laws arise. Such laws, common to all human languages, appear on different
stages from word inventories to networks of interacting words. Among these
seemingly universal traits exhibited by language networks, ambiguity appears to
be a specially relevant component. Ambiguity is avoided in most computational
approaches to language processing, and yet it seems to be a crucial element of
language architecture. Here we review the evidence both from language network
architecture and from theoretical reasonings based on a least effort argument.
Ambiguity is shown to play an essential role in providing a source of language
efficiency, and is likely to be an inevitable byproduct of network growth.

Cooperative Scientific Work, a CSCW'14 workshop. It discusses the role of
software in NSF's CIF21 vision and the SI2 program, which is intended to
support that goal. SI2 primarily supports software projects that are proposed
in response to solicitations, and some of the criteria used by the
peer-reviewers and by NSF in evaluating these projects depend on predicting
scientific impact. This paper discusses some ideas on how the prediction of
scientific impact can be improved.

dielectric medium specified by its permittivity ""epsilon"" and permeability
""mu."" The derivation proceeds from the generalized form of the Lorentz law,
which specifies the force exerted by the electromagnetic E and H fields on the
polarization P and magnetization M of ponderable media. Our stress tensor
differs from the well-known tensors of Abraham and Minkowski, which have been
at the center of a century-old controversy surrounding the momentum of the
electromagnetic field in transparent materials.

versions of the Ricci Dark Energy (RDE) model in a spatially non-flat universe
and in the framework of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz cosmology. For the two cases
containing non-interacting and interacting RDE and Dark Matter (DM), we
obtained the exact differential equation that determines the evolutionary form
of the RDE energy density parameter. Moreover, we obtained the expressions of
the deceleration parameter $q$ and, using a parametrization of the equation of
state (EoS) parameter $\omega_D$ as $\omega_D\left(z\right)=\omega_0+\omega_1
z$, we derived the expressions of both $\omega_0$ and $\omega_1$. We
interestingly found that the expression of $\omega_0$ is the same for both
non-interacting and interacting case. The expression of $\omega_1$ for the
interacting case has strong dependence from the interacting parameter $b^2$.
The parameters derived in this work are done in small redshift approximation
and for low redshift expansion of the EoS parameter.

  probability in Prisoner's Dilemma and other games",,,,,"math.OC cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many cases the Nash equilibria are not predictive of the experimental
players' behaviour. For some games of Game Theory it is proposed here a method
to estimate the probabilities with which the different options will be actually
chosen by balanced players, i.e. players that are neither too competitive, nor
too cooperative. This will allow to measure the intrinsec cooperativeness
degree of a game, only in function of its payoffs. The method is shaped on the
Prisoner's Dilemma, then generalized for asymmetric tables, N players and N
options. It is adapted to other conditions like Chicken Game, Battle of the
Sexes, Stag Hunt and Translators (a new name proposed for a particular
condition). Then the method is applied to other games like Diner's Dilemma,
Public Goods Game, Traveler's Dilemma and War of Attrition. These games are so
analyzed in a probabilistic way that is consistent to what we could expect
intuitively, overcoming some known paradoxes of the Game Theory.
