ascertain the shape of an optical wavefront or its deviation from an ideal
reference. Due to its wide dynamical range and high optical efficiency, the
Shack-Hartmann is nowadays the most widely used of these sensors. Here, we show
that it actually performs a simultaneous measurement of position and angular
spectrum of the incident radiation and, therefore, when combined with
tomographic techniques previously developed for quantum information processing,
the Shack-Hartmann can be instrumental in reconstructing the complete coherence
properties of the signal. We confirm these predictions with an experimental
characterization of partially coherent vortex beams, a case that cannot be
treated with the standard tools. This seems to indicate that classical methods
employed hitherto do not fully exploit the potential of the registered data.

exponential manner away from the defect. The recovery length is found to be on
the order of one lattice constant for weak couplings. This is comparable to the
recovery length of a conventional s-wave state, demonstrating that the

dynamic simulations both damage production induced by low energy ion

considerable recent attention for the problem of estimating a random vector
$\mathbf{x}$ observed through a linear transform $\mathbf{A}$. In the case of
large i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian $\mathbf{A}$, the methods exhibit fast
convergence with precise analytic characterizations on the algorithm behavior.
However, the convergence of AMP under general transforms $\mathbf{A}$ is not
fully understood. In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions for the
convergence of a damped version of the generalized AMP (GAMP) algorithm in the
case of quadratic cost functions (i.e., Gaussian likelihood and prior). It is
shown that, with sufficient damping, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge,
although the amount of damping grows with peak-to-average ratio of the squared
singular values of the transforms $\mathbf{A}$. This result explains the good
performance of AMP on i.i.d. Gaussian transforms $\mathbf{A}$, but also their
difficulties with ill-conditioned or non-zero-mean transforms $\mathbf{A}$. A
related sufficient condition is then derived for the local stability of the
damped GAMP method under general cost functions, assuming certain strict
convexity conditions.

databases of galaxy clusters depends sensitively on the ability to distinguish
between morphological types, especially at higher redshifts. This capability
can be enhanced through a new statistical measure of association and
correlation, called the {\it distance correlation coefficient}, which has more
statistical power to detect associations than does the classical Pearson
measure of linear relationships between two variables. The distance correlation
measure offers a more precise alternative to the classical measure since it is
capable of detecting nonlinear relationships that may appear in astrophysical
applications. We showed recently that the comparison between the distance and
Pearson correlation coefficients can be used effectively to isolate potential
outliers in various galaxy datasets, and this comparison has the ability to
confirm the level of accuracy associated with the data. In this work, we
elucidate the advantages of distance correlation when applied to large
databases. We illustrate how the distance correlation measure can be used
effectively as a tool to confirm nonlinear relationships between various
variables in the COMBO-17 database, including the lengths of the major and
minor axes, and the alternative redshift distribution. For these outlier pairs,
the distance correlation coefficient is routinely higher than the Pearson
coefficient since it is easier to detect nonlinear relationships with distance
correlation. The V-shaped scatterplots of Pearson versus distance correlation
coefficients also reveal the patterns with increasing redshift and the
contributions of different galaxy types within each redshift range.

particular for slowly rotating stars. We investigate its applicability to
existing dispersive long-slit spectrographs, identified here by their plate
scale, and the size of the resulting stellar sample. The stellar rotation
induces a tilt in the stellar lines whose angle depends on the stellar position
angle and the orientation of the slit. We developed a rotation model to
calculate and reproduce the effects of stellar rotation on unreduced high
resolution stellar spectra. Then we retrieved the tilt amplitude using a
spectro-astrometric extraction of the position of the photocentre of the
spectrum. Finally we present two methods for analysing the position spectrum
using either direct measurement of the tilt or a cross-correlation analysis.
For stars with large apparent diameter and using a spectrograph with a small
plate scale, we show that it is possible to determine the stellar position
angle directly within 10deg with a signal-to-noise ratio of the order of 6.
Under less favourable conditions, i.e. larger plate scale or smaller stellar
diameter, the cross-correlation method yields comparable results. We show that
with the currently existing instruments, it is possible to determine the
stellar position angle of at least 50 stars precisely, mostly K-type giants
with apparent diameter down to 5 milliarcseconds. If we consider errors of
around 10deg still acceptable, we may include stars with apparent diameter down

for pure visualization purposes, but it is known that the resulting
iso-surfaces can have holes, and topological problems like missing or wrong
connectivity can appear. To avoid such problems, we introduce a
graph-theoretical method for the computation of iso-surfaces on cuboid meshes
in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The method for the generation of iso-surfaces employs
labeled cuboid graphs $G(V,E,\mathcal{F})$ such that $V$ is the set of vertices
of a cuboid $C\subset\mathbb{R}^3$, $E$ is the set of edges of $C$ and
$\mathcal{F}\,:\,V\rightarrow [0,1]$. The nodes of $G$ are weighted by the
values of $\mathcal{F}$ which represents the volumetric information, e.g.\ from
a Volume of Fluid method. Using a given iso-level $c\in (0,1)$, we first obtain
all iso-points, i.e.\ points where the value $c$ is attained by the
edge-interpolated $\mathcal{F}$-field. The iso-surface is then built from
iso-elements which are composed of triangles and are such that their polygonal
boundary has only iso-points as vertices. All vertices lie on the faces of a
single mesh cell.
  We give a proof that the generated iso-surface is connected up to the
boundary of the domain and it can be decomposed into different oriented
components. Two different components may have discrete points or line segments
in common. The graph-theoretical method for the computation of iso-surfaces
developed in this paper enables to recover local information of the iso-surface
that can be used e.g.\ to compute discrete mean curvature and to solve surface
PDEs. Concerning the computational effort, the resulting algorithm is as
efficient as existing combinatorial methods.

The most remarkable feature of $\lambda^{\left( p\right) }$ is that it
seamlessly joins several other graph parameters, e.g., $\lambda^{\left(

radius and $\lambda^{\left( \infty\right) }/2$ is the number of edges. This
paper presents solutions to some extremal problems about $\lambda^{\left(

spectral extremal problems.
  Let $T_{r}\left( n\right) $ be the $r$-partite Tur\'{a}n graph of order $n.$
Two of the main results in the paper are:
  (I) Let $r\geq2$ and $p>1.$ If $G$ is a $K_{r+1}$-free graph of order $n,$
then \[ \lambda^{\left( p\right) }\left( G\right) <\lambda^{\left( p\right)

$cn^{r-1}$ cliques of order $r+1,$ where $c$ is a positive number depending

  Journal",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  FU Orionis stars (FUORS) are eruptive pre-main sequence objects thought to
represent quasi-periodic or recurring stages of enhanced accretion during the
low-mass star-forming process. We characterize the sample of known and
candidate FUORS in an homogeneous and consistent way, deriving stellar and
circumstellar parameters for each object. We emphasize the analysis in those
parameters that are supposed to vary during the FUORS stage. We modeled the
SEDs of 24 of the 26 currently known FUORS, using the radiative transfer code
of Whitney et al (2003b). We compare our models with those obtained by
Robitaille et al. (2007) for Taurus class II and I sources in quiescence
periods, by calculating the cumulative distribution of the different
parameters. FUORS have more massive disks: we find that $\sim80\%$ of the disks
in FUORS are more massive than any Taurus class II and I sources in the sample.
Median values for the disk mass accretion rates are ~ 1.e-7 Msun/yr vs ~ 1.e-5
Msun/yr for standard YSOs (young stellar objects) and FUORS, respectively.
While the distributions of envelope mass accretion rates for class I FUORS and
for standard class I objects are similar, FUORS, on average, have higher
envelope mass accretion rates than standard class II and class I sources. Most
FUORS (~ 70%) have envelope mass accretion rates above 1.e-7 Msun/yr. In
contrast, 60% of the classical YSO sample have accretion rates below this
value. Our results support the current scenario in which changes experimented
by the circumstellar disk explain the observed properties of these stars.
However, the increase in the disk mass accretion rate is smaller than
theoretically predicte (Frank et al. 1992; Hartmann & Kenyon 1996), though in
good agreement with previous determinations.

stress-based plastic potentials. To gain understanding of the combined effects
of all invariants for general three-dimensional loadings, a strain-rate based
approach appears more appropriate. In this paper, for the first time strain
rate-based potentials for porous solids with Tresca and von Mises, matrices are
obtained. The dilatational response is investigated for general 3-D conditions
for both compressive and tensile states using rigorous upscaling methods. It is
demonstrated that the presence of voids induces dependence on all invariants,
the noteworthy result being the key role played by the plastic flow of the
matrix on the dilatational response. If the matrix obeys the von Mises
criterion, the shape of the cross-sections of the porous solid with the
octahedral plane deviates slightly from a circle, and changes very little as
the absolute value of the mean strain rate increases. However, if the matrix
behavior is described by Tresca's criterion, the shape of the cross-sections
evolves from a regular hexagon to a smooth triangle with rounded corners.
Furthermore, it is revealed that the couplings between invariants are very
specific and depend strongly on the particularities of the plastic flow of the
matrix.

investigated by using fractal and multifractal analysis. We show that the time

an estimate of the longitudinal magnetic field strength for each observation

that HD 1976 is a double-lined spectroscopic (SB2) binary, with the lines of

with limited backhaul capacity is studied. The sBS has a large cache memory and
provides content-level selective offloading by delivering high data rate
contents to users in its coverage area. The goal of the sBS content controller
(CC) is to store the most popular contents in the sBS cache memory such that
the maximum amount of data can be fetched directly form the sBS, not relying on
the limited backhaul resources during peak traffic periods. If the popularity
profile is known in advance, the problem reduces to a knapsack problem.
However, it is assumed in this work that, the popularity profile of the files
is not known by the CC, and it can only observe the instantaneous demand for
the cached content. Hence, the cache content placement is optimised based on
the demand history. By refreshing the cache content at regular time intervals,
the CC tries to learn the popularity profile, while exploiting the limited
cache capacity in the best way possible. Three algorithms are studied for this
cache content placement problem, leading to different exploitation-exploration
trade-offs. We provide extensive numerical simulations in order to study the
time-evolution of these algorithms, and the impact of the system parameters,
such as the number of files, the number of users, the cache size, and the
skewness of the popularity profile, on the performance. It is shown that the
proposed algorithms quickly learn the popularity profile for a wide range of
system parameters.

temperature superconductivity to exotic magnetism. Although both the electron
spin and the structure of the local orbitals play a key role in this physics,
in most systems these are connected only indirectly --- via the Pauli exclusion
principle and the Coulomb interaction. Iridium-based oxides (iridates) open a
further dimension to this problem by introducing strong spin-orbit
interactions, such that the Mott physics has a strong orbital character. In the
layered honeycomb iridates this is thought to generate highly spin-anisotropic
interactions, coupling the spin orientation to a given spatial direction of
exchange and leading to strongly frustrated magnetism. The potential for new
physics emerging from such interactions has driven much scientific excitement,
most recently in the search for a new quantum spin liquid, first discussed by
Kitaev \cite{kitaev_anyons_2006}. Here we report a new iridate structure that
has the same local connectivity as the layered honeycomb, but in a
three-dimensional framework. The temperature dependence of the magnetic
susceptibility exhibits a striking reordering of the magnetic anisotropy,
giving evidence for highly spin-anisotropic exchange interactions. Furthermore,
the basic structural units of this material suggest the possibility of a new
family of structures, the `harmonic honeycomb' iridates. This compound thus
provides a unique and exciting glimpse into the physics of a new class of

fractional quasiparticles carries both spin and orbital quantum numbers, and
the two variables are always entangled in the collective excitations. Our
result further shows that the recently reported separation phenomenon occurs
when crystal fields fully polarize the orbital degrees of freedom. In this
case, however, the spinon and orbiton dynamics are decoupled solely because of
a redefinition of the spin and orbital quantum numbers.

population synthesis models, which allows us to test hypotheses on the star

Galaxy. The new version of the Besancon Galaxy model (hereafter BGM) aims to
provide a more flexible and powerful tool to investigate the initial mass
function (IMF) and star formation rate (SFR) of the Galactic disc. We present a
new strategy for the generation of thin disc stars, which assumes the IMF, SFR
and evolutionary tracks as free parameters. We have updated most of the
ingredients for the star count production and, for the first time, binary stars
are generated in a consistent way. The local dynamical self-consistency is
maintained in this new scheme. We then compare simulations from the new model
with Tycho-2 data and the local luminosity function, as a first test to verify
and constrain the new ingredients. The effects of changing thirteen different
ingredients of the model are systematically studied. For the first time, a full
sky comparison is performed between BGM and data. This strategy allows us to
constrain the IMF slope at high masses, which is found to be close to 3.0 and
excludes a shallower slope such as Salpeter's one. The SFR is found decreasing
whatever IMF is assumed. The model is compatible with a local dark matter
density of 0.011 Mo/pc^3 implying that there is no compelling evidence for the
significant amount of dark matter in the disc. While the model is fitted to
Tycho-2 data, which is a magnitude limited sample with V<11, we check that it
is still consistent with fainter stars. The new model constitutes a new basis
for further comparisons with large scale surveys and is being prepared to
become a powerful tool for the analysis of the Gaia mission data.

the first and the last of which being transient short-time arcs, and the middle
piece being a long-time arc staying exponentially close to the optimal

exponentially close to a steady-state, but also the corresponding adjoint

quantified with the use of appropriate normal forms of Riccati equations. We
show then how the property on the adjoint vector can be adequately used in

insights into the processes shaping clusters. Calibrating proxies for cluster
mass will be crucial to cluster cosmology with upcoming surveys like eROSITA

might be biased low by $\sim\!40$ %, more than previously considered. We extend
the direct calibration of the weak lensing -- X-ray mass scaling towards lower
masses (as low as $1\!\times\!10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) in a sample
representative of the $z\!\sim\!0.4$--$0.5$ population. We investigate the
scaling of MMT/Megacam weak lensing (WL) masses for $8$ clusters at
$0.39\!\leq\!z\!\leq\!0.80$ as part of the \emph{400d} WL programme with
hydrostatic \textit{Chandra} X-ray masses as well as those based on the
proxies, e.g. $Y_{\mathrm{X}}\!=\!T_{\mathrm{X}}M_{\mathrm{gas}}$. Overall, we
find good agreement between WL and X-ray masses, with different mass bias
estimators all consistent with zero. Subdividing the sample, we find the
high-mass subsample to show no significant mass bias while for the low-mass
subsample, there is a bias towards overestimated X-ray masses at the
$\sim\!2\sigma$ level for some mass proxies. The overall scatter in the
mass-mass scaling relations is surprisingly low. Neither observation can be
traced back to the parameter settings in the WL analysis. We do not find
evidence for a strong ($\sim\!40$ %) underestimate in the X-ray masses, as
suggested to reconcile Planck cluster counts and cosmological constraints. For
high-mass clusters, our measurements are consistent with studies in the
literature. The mass dependent bias, significant at $\sim\!2\sigma$, may hint
at a physically different cluster population (less relaxed clusters with more
substructure and mergers); or it may be due to small number statistics.

imaging allows secure counterparts to be identified in the CANDELS multiband
dataset. The CANDELS data provide deep photometric data from UV through
near-infrared wavelengths. Using synthetic spectral energy distributions, we
derive photometric redshifts, stellar masses, extinction, ages, and the star
formation history. The redshift range is z=1.65-4.76, with two of the galaxies
located at z>4. Two SMG counterparts have stellar masses 2-3 orders of
magnitude lower than the rest. The remaining SMG counterparts have stellar
masses around 1x10^11 Msun. The stellar population in the SMGs is typically
older than the expected duration of the submillimeter phase, suggesting that
the star formation history of submillimeter galaxies is more complex than a
single burst. Non-parametric morphology indices suggest that the SMG
counterparts are among the most asymmetric systems compared with galaxies of
the same stellar mass and redshift. The HST images shows that 3 of the SMGs are
associated with on-going mergers. The remaining counterparts are isolated.
Estimating the dust and molecular gas mass from the submm fluxes, and comparing
with our stellar masses shows that the molecular gas mass fraction of SMGs is
~28% and that the final stellar mass is likely to be (1-2)x10^11 Msun.

this paper. We find such unstable states by applying for the first time in a
geophysical context the so-called edge tracking method that has been used for
studying multiple coexisting states in shear flows. We examine robustness,
efficiency, and accuracy properties of the edge tracking algorithm. We find
that the procedure is the most efficient when taking a single bisection per
cycle. Due to the strong diffusivity of the system trajectories of transient
dynamics, initialized between the stable states with respect to the mean
temperature, are confined to the heteroclininc trajectory, one which connects
the fixed unstable and stable states, after relatively short transient times.
This constraint dictates a functional relationship between observables. We
characterize such a relationship between the global average temperature and a
descriptor of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, the large scale temperature
gradient between low and high latitudes. We find that a maximum of the
temperature gradient is realized at the same value of the average temperature,
about 270 K, largely independent of the strength of incoming solar radiation.
We also examine the structural properties of the system defined by the
equilibria depending on the solar strength. We construct new bifurcation
diagrams in terms of quantities relevant for describing the thermodynamic
disequilibrium, such as the temperature gradient and the material entropy
production due to heat transport. We compare our results for the EBM to results

practice is the multilevel approach. During a coarsening phase, a multilevel
graph partitioning algorithm reduces the graph size by iteratively contracting
nodes and edges until the graph is small enough to be partitioned by some other

transferring the solution to the next finer graph and applying a local search
algorithm to improve the current solution.
  In this paper, we describe a novel approach to partition graphs effectively

our algorithm provides graph coarsening by iteratively contracting
size-constrained clusterings that are computed using a label propagation
algorithm. The same algorithm that provides the size-constrained clusterings
can also be used during uncoarsening as a fast and simple local search
algorithm.
  Depending on the algorithm's configuration, we are able to compute partitions

comparable to the best competitor in terms of quality, hMetis, while being
nearly an order of magnitude faster on average. The fastest configuration

relation depends on two wave numbers, $k'$ in the soft domain and $k$ in the

$k'$ is in the linear regime, while the hard mode $k$ goes from linear
($0.1\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$) to nonlinear ($1.0\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$) scales. On
scales $k\lesssim 0.4\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, we confirm the relation within the
statistical error of the simulations (typically a few percent depending on the

perturbation theory by more than $30\%$. We further examine the relation on
smaller scales with higher resolution simulations. We find that the relation
holds within the statistical error of the simulations at $z=1$, whereas we find
deviations as large as $\sim 7\%$ at $k \sim 1.0\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at

mass in elliptical galaxies. We implement a new galaxy-wide stellar initial
mass function (Top Heavy Integrated Galaxy Initial Mass Function, TH-IGIMF) in
the semi-analytic model SAG and evaluate its impact on the chemical evolution
of galaxies. The SFR-dependence of the slope of the TH-IGIMF is found to be key
to reproducing the correct [a/Fe]-stellar mass relation. Massive galaxies reach
higher [a/Fe] abundance ratios because they are characterized by more top-heavy
IMFs as a result of their higher SFR. As a consequence of our analysis, the
value of the minimum embedded star cluster mass and of the slope of the
embedded cluster mass function, which are free parameters involved in the
TH-IGIMF theory, are found to be as low as 5 solar masses and 2, respectively.
A mild downsizing trend is present for galaxies generated assuming either a
universal IMF or a variable TH-IGIMF. We find that, regardless of galaxy mass,
older galaxies (with formation redshifts > 2) are formed in shorter time-scales
(< 2 Gyr), thus achieving larger [a/Fe] values. Hence, the time-scale of galaxy
formation alone cannot explain the slope of the [a/Fe]-galaxy mass relation,
but is responsible for the big dispersion of [a/Fe] abundance ratios at fixed
stellar mass.We further test the hyphothesis of a TH-IGIMF in elliptical
galaxies by looking into mass-to-light ratios, and luminosity functions. Models
with a TH-IGIMF are also favoured by these constraints. In particular,
mass-to-light ratios agree with observed values for massive galaxies while
being overpredicted for less massive ones; this overprediction is present
regardless of the IMF considered.

using simplified models, in which one fixes the masses and couplings of most

technique for combining multiple simplified models (that requires no additional
simulation) thereby highlighting the utility and limitations of simplified
models in general, and demonstrating a simple way of improving LHC search
strategies. The technique is used to derive limits on the stop mass that are
model independent, modulo some reasonably generic assumptions which are
quantified precisely. We find that current ATLAS and CMS results exclude stop
masses up to 340 GeV for neutralino masses up to 120 GeV, provided that the
total branching ratio into channels other than top-neutralino and
bottom-chargino is small, and that there is no mass difference smaller than 10

initial state and the Hamiltonian characterizing the system. The fastest
fidelity decay in this case is Gaussian and can persist until saturation. A
simple general picture, in which the fidelity plays a central role, is also
achieved for the short-time dynamics of few-body observables. It holds for
initial states that are eigenstates of the observables. We also discuss the

developed for initial states that can be prepared in experiments with cold

constructed entirely from its analytic properties, without ever inspecting any

an ansatz in terms of hexagon functions, and fixing coefficients in the ansatz

polylogarithms, and in terms of the coproduct for the associated Hopf algebra.
From the remainder function, we extract the BFKL eigenvalue at
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy (NNLLA), and the impact factor at
NNNLLA. We plot the remainder function along various lines and on one surface,
studying ratios of successive loop orders. As seen previously through three
loops, these ratios are surprisingly constant over large regions in the space
of cross ratios, and they are not far from the value expected at asymptotically
large orders of perturbation theory.

sensitivities of statistical moments and reliability of high-dimensional

integration of polynomial dimensional decomposition (PDD) of a multivariate
stochastic response function and score functions. Applied to the statistical
moments, the method provides mean-square convergent analytical expressions of
design sensitivities of the first two moments of a stochastic response. The
second and third methods, relevant to probability distribution or reliability
analysis, exploit two distinct combinations built on PDD: the PDD-SPA method,
entailing the saddlepoint approximation (SPA) and score functions; and the
PDD-MCS method, utilizing the embedded Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) of the PDD
approximation and score functions. For all three methods developed, the
statistical moments or failure probabilities and their design sensitivities are
both determined concurrently from a single stochastic analysis or simulation.
Numerical examples, including a 100-dimensional mathematical problem, indicate
that the new methods developed provide not only theoretically convergent or
accurate design sensitivities, but also computationally efficient solutions. A
practical example involving robust design optimization of a three-hole bracket
illustrates the usefulness of the proposed methods.

rapidly adapting microbial populations, this process is particularly hard to
predict because lineages with different beneficial mutations often spread
simultaneously and interfere with one another's fixation. Hence to predict the
fate of any individual variant, we must know the rate at which new mutations
create competing lineages of higher fitness. Here, we directly measured the
effect of this interference on the fates of specific adaptive variants in
laboratory Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations and used these measurements to
infer the distribution of fitness effects of new beneficial mutations. To do
so, we seeded marked lineages with different fitness advantages into replicate
populations and tracked their subsequent frequencies for hundreds of
generations. Our results illustrate the transition between strongly
advantageous lineages which decisively sweep to fixation and more moderately
advantageous lineages that are often outcompeted by new mutations arising
during the course of the experiment. We developed an approximate likelihood
framework to compare our data to simulations and found that the effects of
these competing beneficial mutations were best approximated by an exponential
distribution, rather than one with a single effect size. We then used this
inferred distribution of fitness effects to predict the rate of adaptation in a
set of independent control populations. Finally, we discuss how our
experimental design can serve as a screen for rare, large-effect beneficial
mutations.

based on ratings from members in a community. The adoption of reputation
systems, however, relies on their ability to capture the actual trustworthiness
of a target. Several reputation models for aggregating trust information have
been proposed in the literature. The choice of model has an impact on the
reliability of the aggregated trust information as well as on the procedure
used to compute reputations. Two prominent models are flow-based reputation
(e.g., EigenTrust, PageRank) and Subjective Logic based reputation. Flow-based
models provide an automated method to aggregate trust information, but they are
not able to express the level of uncertainty in the information. In contrast,
Subjective Logic extends probabilistic models with an explicit notion of
uncertainty, but the calculation of reputation depends on the structure of the
trust network and often requires information to be discarded. These are severe
drawbacks.
  In this work, we observe that the `opinion discounting' operation in
Subjective Logic has a number of basic problems. We resolve these problems by
providing a new discounting operator that describes the flow of evidence from
one party to another. The adoption of our discounting rule results in a
consistent Subjective Logic algebra that is entirely based on the handling of
evidence. We show that the new algebra enables the construction of an automated
reputation assessment procedure for arbitrary trust networks, where the
calculation no longer depends on the structure of the network, and does not
need to throw away any information. Thus, we obtain the best of both worlds:
flow-based reputation and consistent handling of uncertainties.

  underfitting problems in variation partitioning methods: with a special focus
  on the mixed co-variation","19 pages",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  The effectiveness and validity of applying variation partitioning methods in
community ecology has been questioned. Here, using mathematical deduction and
numerical simulation, we made an attempt to uncover the underlying mechanisms
determining the effectiveness of variation partitioning techniques. The
covariance among independent variables determines the under-fitting and
over-fitting problem with the variation partitioning process. Ideally, it is
assumed that the covariance among independent variables will be zero (no
correlation at all), however, typically there will be some colinearities.
Therefore, we analyzed the role of slight covariance on influencing species
variation partitioning. We concluded that when the covariance between spatial
and environmental predictors is positive, all the three components-pure
environmental, spatial variations and mixed covariation were over-fitted, with
the sign of the true covariation being negative. In contrast, when the
covariance is negative, all the three components were under-fitted with the
sign of true covariation being positive. Other factors, including extra noise
levels, the strengths of variable coefficients and the patterns of landscape
gradients, could reduce the fitting problems caused by the covariance of
variables. The conventional calculation of mixed covariation is incorrect and
misleading, as the true and estimated covariations are always sign-opposite. In
conclusion, I challenge the conventional three-step procedure of variation
partitioning, suggesting that a full regression model with all variables
together is robust enough to correctly partition variations.

offers a guaranteed bound on loss of privacy due to release of query results,
even under worst-case assumptions. The theory of differential privacy is an
active research area, and there are now differentially private algorithms for a
wide range of interesting problems.
  However, the question of when differential privacy works in practice has
received relatively little attention. In particular, there is still no rigorous
method for choosing the key parameter $\epsilon$, which controls the crucial
tradeoff between the strength of the privacy guarantee and the accuracy of the
published results.
  In this paper, we examine the role that these parameters play in concrete
applications, identifying the key questions that must be addressed when
choosing specific values. This choice requires balancing the interests of two
different parties: the data analyst and the prospective participant, who must
decide whether to allow their data to be included in the analysis. We propose a
simple model that expresses this balance as formulas over a handful of
parameters, and we use our model to choose $\epsilon$ on a series of simple
statistical studies. We also explore a surprising insight: in some
circumstances, a differentially private study can be more accurate than a
non-private study for the same cost, under our model. Finally, we discuss the
simplifying assumptions in our model and outline a research agenda for possible

decomposition (PDD) methods for solving high-dimensional uncertainty
quantification problems in computational science and engineering. The methods
entail global sensitivity analysis for retaining important PDD component
functions, and a full- or sparse-grid dimension-reduction integration or quasi
Monte Carlo simulation for estimating the PDD expansion coefficients. A unified
algorithm, endowed with two distinct ranking schemes for grading component
functions, was created for their numerical implementation. The fully
adaptive-sparse PDD method is comprehensive and rigorous, leading to the
second-moment statistics of a stochastic response that converges to the exact
solution when the tolerances vanish. A partially adaptive-sparse PDD method,
obtained through regulated adaptivity and sparsity, is economical and is,
therefore, expected to solve practical problems with numerous variables.
Compared with past developments, the adaptive-sparse PDD methods do not require
its truncation parameter(s) to be assigned \emph{a priori} or arbitrarily. The
numerical results reveal that an adaptive-sparse PDD method achieves a desired
level of accuracy with considerably fewer coefficients compared with existing
PDD approximations. For a required accuracy in calculating the probabilistic
response characteristics, the new bivariate adaptive-sparse PDD method is more
efficient than the existing bivariately truncated PDD method by almost an order
of magnitude. Finally, stochastic dynamic analysis of a disk brake system was
performed, demonstrating the ability of the new methods to tackle practical
engineering problems.

beamformers using constrained optimization is proposed. In the method, the
maximum passband ripple and minimum stopband attenuation are ensured to be
within prescribed levels, while at the same time maintaining a good
linear-phase characteristic at a prescribed group delay in the passband. Since
the beamformer is intended primarily for small-sized microphone arrays where
the microphone spacing is small relative to the wavelength at low frequencies,
the beamformer can become highly sensitive to spatial white noise and array
imperfections if a direct minimization of the error is performed. Therefore, to
limit the sensitivity of the beamformer the optimization is carried out by
constraining a sensitivity parameter, namely, the white noise gain (WNG) to be
above prescribed levels across the frequency band. Two novel design variants
have been developed. The first variant is formulated as a convex optimization
problem where the maximum error in the passband is minimized, while the second
variant is formulated as an iterative optimization problem and has the
advantage of significantly improving the linear-phase characteristics of the
beamformer under any prescribed group delay or linear-array configuration. In
the second variant, the passband group-delay deviation is minimized while
ensuring that the maximum passband ripple and stopband attenuation are within
prescribed levels. To reduce the computational effort in carrying out the
optimization, a nonuniform variable sampling approach over the frequency and
angular dimensions is used to compute the required parameters. Experiment
results show that beamformers designed using the proposed methods have much
smaller passband group-delay deviation for similar passband ripple and stopband
attenuation than a modified version of an existing method.

Information-Centric Networking (ICN) emphasizes content by making it directly
addressable and routable. Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture is an
instance of ICN that is being developed as a candidate next-generation Internet
architecture. By opportunistically caching content within the network (in
routers), NDN appears to be well-suited for large-scale content distribution
and for meeting the needs of increasingly mobile and bandwidth-hungry
applications that dominate today's Internet.
  One key feature of NDN is the requirement for each content object to be
digitally signed by its producer. Thus, NDN should be, in principle, immune to
distributing fake (aka ""poisoned"") content. However, in practice, this poses
two challenges for detecting fake content in NDN routers: (1) overhead due to
signature verification and certificate chain traversal, and (2) lack of trust
context, i.e., determining which public keys are trusted to verify which
content. Because of these issues, NDN does not force routers to verify content
signatures, which makes the architecture susceptible to content poisoning
attacks.
  This paper explores root causes of, and some cures for, content poisoning
attacks in NDN. In the process, it becomes apparent that meaningful mitigation
of content poisoning is contingent upon a network-layer trust management
architecture, elements of which we construct while carefully justifying
specific design choices. This work represents the initial effort towards
comprehensive trust management for NDN.

adapt Maximum Caliber, a variational principle in which a path entropy is
maximized over the distribution of all the possible trajectories, subject to
basic kinetic constraints and some average dynamical observables. We show that
this approach leads, under appropriate conditions, to the continuous-time
master equation and a Smoluchowski-like equation that is valid for both
equilibrium and non-equilibrium stationary states. We illustrate the method by
computing the solvation dynamics of water molecules from molecular dynamics
trajectories.

affirmatively for rank-$1$ games, leaving rank-2 and beyond unresolved.
  In this paper we show that NE computation in games with rank $\ge 3$, is
PPAD-hard, settling a decade long open problem. Interestingly, this is the
first instance that a problem with an FPTAS turns out to be PPAD-hard. Our
reduction bypasses graphical games and game gadgets, and provides a simpler

the augmented residual of the Tikhonov regularized least squares problem.
Weighting of the data fidelity by a known Gaussian noise distribution on the
measured data, when the regularization term is weighted by unknown inverse
covariance information on the model parameters, the minimum of the Tikhonov
functional is a random variable following a $\chi^2$-distribution with $m+p-n$
degrees of freedom, model matrix $G:$ $m \times n$ and regularizer $L:$
$p\times n$. It is proved that the result holds also for $m<n$ when $m+p\ge n$.
A Newton root-finding algorithm is used to find the regularization parameter
$\alpha$ which yields the optimal inverse covariance weighting in the case of a
white noise assumption on the mapped model data. It is implemented for
small-scale problems using the generalized singular value decomposition.
Numerical results verify the algorithm for the case of regularizers
approximating zero to second order derivative approximations, contrasted with
the methods of generalized cross validation and unbiased predictive risk
estimation. The inversion of underdetermined $2D$ focusing gravity data
produces models with non-smooth properties, for which typical implementations
in this field use the iterative minimum support (MS) stabilizer and both
regularizer and regularizing parameter are updated each iteration. For a
simulated data set with noise, the regularization parameter estimation methods
for underdetermined data sets are used in this iterative framework, also
contrasted with the L-curve and MDP. Experiments demonstrate efficiency and
robustness of the $\chi^2$-principle, moreover the L-curve and MDP are
generally outperformed. Furthermore, the MS is of general use for the
$\chi^2$-principle when implemented without the knowledge of a mean value of
the model.

influenced pore network connectivity, which has previously been modeled by
percolation on infinite lattices. Our hypothesis is that percolation occurs
instead through finite networks of micropores connecting accessible macropores,
always exposed to the outside environment. We derive a general formula for
sorption/desorption isotherms that introduces a simple measure of hierarchical
pore connectivity -- the fraction $f$ of always exposed pores. The model thus
accounts for ""small world"" connections in finite-size percolation, while also
incorporating other hysteresis mechanisms, in single-pore filling, liquid
insertion into the solid matrix, and cavitation. Our formula is able to fit and
interpret both primary and scanning sorption/desorption isotherms for a variety
of adsorbates (noble gases, water, and organics) and porous materials (cement
pastes, dental enamels, porous glasses, carbon black and nanotubes), including
cases with broad pore-size distributions and large hysteresis. It allows
quantification of the prevalence of percolating macropores in the material,
even though these pores are never filled during the sorption experiments. A
distinct bump in sorption isotherms is explained as a lowering of the barrier
to nucleation of the vapor phase with a universal temperature scaling.

the moderately slow decay observed in reality is not typical in the present

  The fact that macroscopic systems approach thermal equilibrium may seem
puzzling, for example, because it may seem to conflict with the
time-reversibility of the microscopic dynamics. According the present result,
what needs to be explained is, not that macroscopic systems approach
equilibrium, but that they do so slowly.

synthetic database approach. Departing from the existing approaches that
require the query set to be specified in advance, we advocate to devise
query-set independent mechanisms, with an ambitious goal of providing accurate
answers, while meeting the privacy constraints, for all queries in a general
query class. Specifically, a differentially private mechanism is constructed to
""encode"" rich stochastic structure into the synthetic database, and
""customized"" companion estimators are then derived to provide accurate answers
by making use of all available information, including the mechanism (which is
public information) and the query functions. Accordingly, the distortion under
the best of this kind of mechanisms at the worst-case query in a general query
class, so called the minimax distortion, provides a fundamental
characterization of differentially private query release.
  For the general class of statistical queries, we prove that with the
squared-error distortion measure, the minimax distortion is $O(1/n)$ by
deriving asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds in the regime that the
database size $n$ goes to infinity. The upper bound is achievable by a
mechanism $\mathcal{E}$ and its corresponding companion estimators, which
points directly to the feasibility of the proposed approach in large databases.
We further evaluate the mechanism $\mathcal{E}$ and the companion estimators
through experiments on real datasets from Netflix and Facebook. Experimental
results show improvement over the state-of-art MWEM algorithm and verify the
scaling behavior $O(1/n)$ of the minimax distortion.

quadratic (seagull) couplings in various supersymmetric theories. In analogy to
the local renormalization group formalism, we provide a prescription for how to
fix the quadratic couplings. They generally arise at two-loops in perturbation
theory. We check our prescription by explicitly computing these couplings in
several examples such as mass-deformed ${\cal N}$ = 4 and in the Coulomb phase
of some theories. These couplings affect the Lagrangians of rigid
supersymmetric theories in curved space. In addition, our analysis leads to a
transparent derivation of the phenomenon known as Anomaly Mediation. In
contrast to previous approaches, we obtain both the gaugino and scalar masses
of Anomaly Mediation by relying just on classical, minimal supergravity and a
manifestly local and supersymmetric Wilsonian point of view. Our discussion
naturally incorporates the connection between Anomaly Mediation and
supersymmetric $AdS_4$ Lagrangians. This note can be read without prior

sheet caused by the deposition of Pd nanoclusters, as demonstrated by weak
localization measurements. The dephasing lengths reached saturated values at
low temperatures. Theoretical calculations indicate the p-type charge transfer
from the Pd clusters, which contributes more carriers. The saturated values of
dephasing lengths often depend on both the carrier concentration and mean free
path. Although some impurities are increased as revealed by decreased
mobilities, the intense charge transfer leads to the improved saturated values
and subsequent improved dephasing lengths.

of $r-$band light in the bulge, $B/T$, and their status as a central or
satellite galaxy at $0.01<z<0.2$. For central galaxies we confirm that the
quiescent fraction depends not only on stellar mass, but also on $R_e$. The
dependence is particularly strong as a function of $M_*/R_e^\alpha$, with
$\alpha\sim 1.5$. This appears to be driven by a simple dependence on $B/T$
over the mass range $9 < \log(M_*/M_\odot) < 11.5$, and is qualitatively
similar even if galaxies with $B/T>0.3$ are excluded. For satellite galaxies,
the quiescent fraction is always larger than that of central galaxies, for any
combination of $M_*$, $R_e$ and $B/T$. The quenching efficiency is not
constant, but reaches a maximum of $\sim 0.7$ for galaxies with $9 <
\log(M_*/M_\odot) < 9.5$ and $R_e<1$ kpc. This is the same region of parameter
space in which the satellite fraction itself reaches its maximum value,
suggesting that the transformation from an active central galaxy to a quiescent
satellite is associated with a reduction in $R_e$ due to an increase in
dominance of a bulge component.

consists of applying a rotating magnetic field to a rigid, helically-shaped,
propeller attached to a magnetic head. When the resulting device, termed an
artificial bacteria flagellum, is aligned perpendicularly to the applied field,
the helix rotates and the swimmer moves forward. Experimental investigation of
artificial bacteria flagella shows that at low frequency of the applied field,
the axis of the helix does not align perpendicularly to the field but wobbles
around the helix, with an angle increasing as the inverse of the field
frequency. By numerical computations and asymptotic analysis, we provide a

the neutrino emission on the 10-20% level, and accretion continuing beyond the

downflows will be signaled by activity intervals stretching over an extended

Our model gives a better understanding of the transition and is relevant in a

far from the planets. For example, it seems unlikely that viscous forces are at
all significant in planetary interiors, yet some of the simulations display a
significant dependence on viscosity, and indeed in some of the simulations the
dynamo mechanism is itself viscously driven, taking the form of helical Ekman
pumping within columnar convection rolls. Given the similarity of the external
magnetic fields observed in the terrestrial planets and gas giants, and the
extremely small value of the Ekman number in all such cases, it seems natural
to suppose that the underlying dynamo mechanism in these planets is independent
of viscosity and insensitive to mechanical boundary conditions. A key step to
identifying this mechanism is to determine the source of helicity in planetary
cores. In this paper we explore the possibility that the helicity in the core
of the Earth arises from the spontaneous emission of inertial waves, driven by
the equatorial heat flux in the outer core.

While rigid
rods rotate on Jeffery orbits, flexible polymers stretch and coil up during
tumbling. Theoretical results show that in both of these asymptotic regimes the
tumbling frequency f_c in a linear shear flow of strength \gamma scales as a
power law Wi^(2/3) in the Weissenberg number Wi=\gamma \tau, where \tau is a
characteristic time of the polymer's relaxational dynamics. For flexible
polymers these theoretical results are well confirmed by experimental single
molecule studies. However, for the intermediate semiflexible regime the
situation is less clear. Here we perform extensive Brownian dynamics
simulations to explore the tumbling dynamics of semiflexible polymers over a
broad range of shear strength and the polymer's persistence length l_p. We find
that the Weissenberg number alone does not suffice to fully characterize the
tumbling dynamics, and the classical scaling law breaks down. Instead, both the
polymer's stiffness and the shear rate are relevant control parameters. Based
on our Brownian dynamics simulations we postulate that in the parameter range
most relevant for cytoskeletal filaments there is a distinct scaling behavior
with f_c \tau*=Wi^(3/4) f_c (x) with Wi=\gamma \tau* and the scaling variable
x=(l_p/L)(Wi)^(-1/3); here \tau* is the time the polymer's center of mass
requires to diffuse its own contour length L. Comparing these results with
experimental data on F-actin we find that the Wi^(3/4) scaling law agrees
quantitatively significantly better with the data than the classical Wi^(2/3)
law. Finally, we extend our results to single ring polymers in shear flow, and
find similar results as for linear polymers with slightly different power laws.

inequalities both theoretically and experimentally, the known inequalities in

possible to observe Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering for some steerable mixed
states. Recently, a simple approach was presented to identify
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering based on all-versus-nothing argument, offering
a strong condition to witness the steerability of a family of two-qubit (pure
or mixed) entangled states. In this work, we show that the all-versus-nothing
proof of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering can be tested by measuring the
projective probabilities. Through the bound of probabilities imposed by
local-hidden-state model, the proposed test shows that steering can be detected
by the all-versus-nothing argument experimentally even in the presence of
imprecision and errors. Our test can be implemented in many physical systems
and we discuss the possible realizations of our scheme with non-Abelian anyons
and trapped ions.

naturally defines a proportional allocation game. Recently, Syrgkanis and
Tardos (STOC 2013) quantified the inefficiency of equilibria in this game with

allowing componentwise symbolic addition of variables (of the same dimension)

multiplication, and other basic matrix operations can be solved in polynomial
time for MTDD_+-represented matrices. On the other hand, testing whether the

groupoids, that means for Lie groupoids together with a given groupoid
equivariant $PU(H)-$principle bundle. The construction is based on the use of
geometric deformation groupoids, these objects allow in particular to give a
geometric construction of the associated pushforward maps and to establish the
functoriality. The main results in this paper are to define the geometric
twisted K-homology groups and to construct the assembly map. Even in the
untwisted case the fact that the geometric twisted K-homology groups and the
geometric assembly map are well defined for Lie groupoids is new, as it was
only sketched by Connes in his book for general Lie groupoids without any
restrictive hypothesis, in particular for non Hausdorff Lie groupoids.
  We also prove the Morita invariance of the assembly map, giving thus a
precise meaning to the geometric assembly map for twisted differentiable
stacks. We discuss the relation of the assembly map with the associated
assembly map of the $S^1$-central extension. The relation with the analytic
assembly map is treated, as well as some cases in which we have an isomorphism.
One important tool is the twisted Thom isomorphism in the groupoid equivariant
case which we establish in the appendix.

hence, a `short cut' between the probability density in ordinary space and the
one in superspace. We emphasize that this point was one of the main problems
and critiques of the supersymmetry method since only implicit dualities between
ordinary and superspace were known before. As examples we apply this approach
to the calculation of the supersymmetric analogue of a Lorentzian (Cauchy)

partially quenched partition function of the three chiral Gaussian ensembles

$1\,\mathrm{km}^3$ of Antarctic ice. The detector can be used to search for
signatures of particle physics beyond the Standard Model. Here, we describe the
search for non-relativistic, magnetic monopoles as remnants of the GUT (Grand
Unified Theory) era shortly after the Big Bang. These monopoles may catalyze
the decay of nucleons via the Rubakov-Callan effect with a cross section
suggested to be in the range of $10^{-27}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ to
$10^{-21}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$. In IceCube, the Cherenkov light from nucleon decays
along the monopole trajectory would produce a characteristic hit pattern. This
paper presents the results of an analysis of first data taken from May 2011
until May 2012 with a dedicated slow-particle trigger for DeepCore, a
subdetector of IceCube. A second analysis provides better sensitivity for the
brightest non-relativistic monopoles using data taken from May 2009 until May
2010. In both analyses no monopole signal was observed. For catalysis cross
sections of $10^{-22}\,(10^{-24})\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ the flux of non-relativistic
GUT monopoles is constrained up to a level of $\Phi_{90} \le
10^{-18}\,(10^{-17})\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}sr^{-1}}$ at a 90% confidence level,
which is three orders of magnitude below the Parker bound. The limits assume a
dominant decay of the proton into a positron and a neutral pion. These results
improve the current best experimental limits by one to two orders of magnitude,
for a wide range of assumed speeds and catalysis cross sections.

investment return or terminal wealth, more and more portfolio models have
shifted their focus to manage ""asymmetric"" downside risks that the investment
return is below certain threshold. Among the existing downside risk measures,
the lower-partial moments (LPM) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) are
probably most promising. In this paper we investigate the dynamic mean-LPM and
mean-CVaR portfolio optimization problems in continuous-time, while the current
literature has only witnessed their static versions. Our contributions are
two-fold, in both building up tractable formulations and deriving corresponding
analytical solutions. By imposing a limit funding level on the terminal wealth,
we conquer the ill-posedness exhibited in the class of mean-downside risk
portfolio models. The limit funding level not only enables us to solve both
dynamic mean-LPM and mean-CVaR portfolio optimization problems, but also offers
a flexibility to tame the aggressiveness of the portfolio policies generated
from such mean - downside risk models. More specifically, for a general market
setting, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the Lagrangian multiplies,
which is a key step in applying the martingale approach, and establish a
theoretical foundation for developing efficient numerical solution approaches.
Moreover, for situations where the opportunity set of the market setting is
deterministic, we derive analytical portfolio policies for both dynamic
mean-LPM and mean-CVaR formulations.

random anisotropic media. It relies on a kinetic approach of wave propagation
phenomena pertaining to the situation whereby the wavelength is comparable to
the correlation length of the weak random inhomogeneities--the so-called weak
coupling limit. The waves are described in terms of their associated energy
densities in the phase space position x wave vector. They satisfy radiative
transfer equations in this scaling, characterized by collision operators
depending on the correlation structure of the heterogeneities. The derivation
is based on a multi-scale asymptotic analysis using spatio-temporal Wigner
transforms and their interpretation in terms of semiclassical operators, along
the same lines as Bal [Wave Motion 43, 132-157 (2005)]. The model accounts for
all possible polarizations of waves in anisotropic elastic media and their
interactions, as well as for the degeneracy directions of propagation when two
phase speeds possibly coincide. Thus it embodies isotropic elasticity which was
considered in several previous publications. Some particular anisotropic cases
of engineering interest are derived in detail.

active regions (ARs) and in the quiet Sun (QS) on the solar irradiance, it is
fundamental to investigate the physical processes underlying their continuum
brightness. Previous results showed that magnetic elements in the QS reach
larger continuum intensities than in ARs at disk center, but left this
difference unexplained.
  We use Hinode/SP disk center data to study the influence of the local amount
of magnetic flux on the vigour of the convective flows and the continuum
intensity contrasts. The apparent (i.e. averaged over a pixel) longitudinal
field strength and line-of-sight (LOS) plasma velocity were retrieved by means
of Milne-Eddington inversions (VFISV code). We analyzed a series of boxes taken
over AR plages and the QS, to determine how the continuum intensity contrast of
magnetic elements, the amplitude of the vertical flows and the box-averaged
contrast were affected by the mean longitudinal field strength in the box
(which scales with the total unsigned flux in the box).
  Our results suggest that as the magnetic flux increases locally (e.g. from
weak network to strong plage), the heating of the magnetic elements is reduced
by the intermediate of a more suppressed convective energy transport within the
larger and stronger magnetic patches. This, together with the known presence of
larger magnetic features, could explain the previously found lower contrasts of
the brightest magnetic elements in ARs compared to the QS. The inhibition of
convection also affects the average continuum brightness of a photospheric
region, so that at disk center, an area of photosphere in strong network or
plage appears darker than a purely quiet one. This is qualitatively consistent
with the predictions of 3D MHD simulations.

Sciences and play a key role in modeling complex networked systems. In
particular, recently there is an ever-increasing interest in modeling dynamic
complex networks, i.e. networks in which the topological structure (nodes and
edges) may vary over time. In this context, we propose a novel model for
representing finite discrete Time-Varying Graphs (TVGs), which are typically
used to model dynamic complex networked systems. We analyze the data structures
built from our proposed model and demonstrate that, for most practical cases,
the asymptotic memory complexity of our model is in the order of the
cardinality of the set of edges. Further, we show that our proposal is an
unifying model that can represent several previous (classes of) models for
dynamic networks found in the recent literature, which in general are unable to
represent each other. In contrast to previous models, our proposal is also able
to intrinsically model cyclic (i.e. periodic) behavior in dynamic networks.
These representation capabilities attest the expressive power of our proposed
unifying model for TVGs. We thus believe our unifying model for TVGs is a step
forward in the theoretical foundations for data analysis of complex networked
systems.

architectures of LU factorization over a finite field. Compared to the
corresponding numerical routines, we have identified three main difficulties
specific to linear algebra over finite fields. First, the arithmetic complexity
could be dominated by modular reductions. Therefore, it is mandatory to delay
as much as possible these reductions while mixing fine-grain parallelizations
of tiled iterative and recursive algorithms. Second, fast linear algebra
variants, e.g., using Strassen-Winograd algorithm, never suffer from
instability and can thus be widely used in cascade with the classical
algorithms. There, trade-offs are to be made between size of blocks well suited
to those fast variants or to load and communication balancing. Third, many
applications over finite fields require the rank profile of the matrix (quite
often rank deficient) rather than the solution to a linear system. It is thus
important to design parallel algorithms that preserve and compute this rank
profile. Moreover, as the rank profile is only discovered during the algorithm,
block size has then to be dynamic. We propose and compare several block
decomposition: tile iterative with left-looking, right-looking and Crout
variants, slab and tile recursive. Experiments demonstrate that the tile
recursive variant performs better and matches the performance of reference
numerical software when no rank deficiency occur. Furthermore, even in the most
heterogeneous case, namely when all pivot blocks are rank deficient, we show
that it is possbile to maintain a high efficiency.

kidney of breeding male bullheads were quantified using the kidney epithelium
height (KEH) assay previously developed and validated for the stickleback. In
the next step, the effect of trenbolone acetate (TbA), a model androgen, was
assessed to identify potential androgenic regulation of bullhead kidney
hypertrophy. Measurement of KEH performed on adult non-breeding male and female
bullheads exposed for 14 and 21 days to 0, 1.26 and 6.50 mu g/L showed that
kidney hypertrophy is induced in a dose-dependent manner, confirming the
hypothesis that the European bullhead possesses a potential biomarker of
androgen exposure. Combined with the wide distribution of the European bullhead
in European countries and the potential of this fish species for environmental
toxicology studies in field and laboratory conditions, the hypothesis of a

the use of the bullhead as a relevant sentinel fish species in monitoring

stars and are commonly recognized as nurseries of planetary systems. Their
lifetime, appearance, and structure are determined by an interplay between

agents in disks. Dust grains dominate the disk opacities, reprocess most of the
stellar radiation, and shield molecules from ionizing UV/X-ray photons. Disks
also dynamically evolve by building up planetary systems which drastically

plasma leads to the distortions of the planckian spectrum shape of the cosmic
microwave background radiation (CMB). We discuss the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich
(SZ) effect with taking into account primordial recombination radiation (PRR).
Since in the thermal SZ effect the redistribution of the photons depends on the
derivatives of the spectrum, the value of relative correction to SZ effect due
to PRR significantly higher than relative corrections due to PRR in the initial
spectrum.
  Calculations of corrections to the thermal SZ effect due to PRR show that
depending on the cluster parameters:
  1) in the range of frequencies $\nu$ = 0.3 - 700 GHz where the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) dominates and spectrum is very close to the
planckian one the relative corrections due to PRR have an order of $10^{-9} -
10^{-6}$ of ""pure"" SZ effect (i.e. SZ effect for pure planckian spectrum). The
difference of intensities of PRR coming from different directions (through
intracluster and near intercluster medium) reaches values up to 22 mJy/ster at
$\nu\simeq 337$ GHz (maximum in considered range).
  2) In the range of frequencies $\nu$ = 700 - 5000 GHz where cosmic infrared
background (CIB) becomes significant or even dominates the relative corrections
due to PRR can reach $10^{-8}$ - $10^{-5}$ of ""pure"" SZ effect. Corresponding
intensity difference reaches values up to 25 mJy/ster (at $\nu\simeq 1700$

  In addition we suggest a modification of the method of electron gas
temperature determination using corrections of the SZ effect due to PRR. Such
modification allows one to simplify the determination of the cluster electron
gas temperature in comparison with known methods.

difference in properties of waves, propagating upward and downward with respect

autonomous outdoor flight with up to 10 flying agents. By decentralized and
autonomous we mean that all members navigate themselves based on the dynamic
information received from other robots in the vicinity. We do not use central
data processing or control; instead, all the necessary computations are carried
out by miniature on-board computers. The only global information the system
exploits is from GPS receivers, while the units use wireless modules to share
this positional information with other flock members locally. Collective
behavior is based on a decentralized control framework with bio-inspiration
from statistical physical modelling of animal swarms. In addition, the model is
optimized for stable group flight even in a noisy, windy, delayed and
error-prone environment. Using this framework we successfully implemented
several fundamental collective flight tasks with up to 10 units: i) we achieved
self-propelled flocking in a bounded area with self-organized object avoidance
capabilities and ii) performed collective target tracking with stable formation
flights (grid, rotating ring, straight line). With realistic numerical
simulations we demonstrated that the local broadcast-type communication and the
decentralized autonomous control method allows for the scalability of the model
for much larger flocks.

had just shown that Einstein's supposedly static universe of 1917 was not
stable. This forced Einstein to rethink his cosmology. He spent January and
February 1931 at Pasadena. There, he discussed cosmology intensely with Tolman,
conscious that he had to replace his original model of 1917. However, at the
end of February he still had not made up his mind about an alternative. The
Albert Einstein Archives of Jerusalem (AEA) hold an undated draft, handwritten
by Einstein, which I date to the beginning of January 1931. In this draft
Einstein hopes to have found a solution to the cosmological problem: a
stationary, dynamic universe in expansion. His model was stationary because
particles leaving a given volume were replaced by particles created out of the
vacuum, anticipating an idea of Bondi, Gold and Hoyle published in 1948. He saw
the cosmological term as energy reservoir. However, he realised that his
calculations contained a numerical error. When the error was corrected his
steady-state-model collapsed.

spectral utilization efficiency of cellular systems. Unlike other performance
metrics, ASE takes into account the spatial property of cellular systems. In
this paper, we generalize the concept of ASE to study arbitrary wireless
transmissions. Specifically, we introduce the notion of affected area to
characterize the spatial property of arbitrary wireless transmissions. Based on
the definition of affected area, we define the performance metric, generalized
area spectral efficiency (GASE), to quantify the spatial spectral utilization
efficiency as well as the greenness of wireless transmissions. After
illustrating its evaluation for point-to-point transmission, we analyze the
GASE performance of several different transmission scenarios, including
dual-hop relay transmission, three-node cooperative relay transmission and
underlay cognitive radio transmission. We derive closed-form expressions for
the GASE metric of each transmission scenario under Rayleigh fading environment
whenever possible. Through mathematical analysis and numerical examples, we
show that the GASE metric provides a new perspective on the design and
optimization of wireless transmissions, especially on the transmitting power
selection. We also show that introducing relay nodes can greatly improve the
spatial utilization efficiency of wireless systems. We illustrate that the GASE
metric can help optimize the deployment of underlay cognitive radio systems.

dynamics are spatially decaying and the sensing and controls are spatially

a notion of spatial distance with respect to which couplings between the
subsystems can be quantified using a class of coupling weight functions. We
exploit spatial decay property of the underlying dynamics of the system to
introduce a class of sparsity and spatial localization measures for spatially
distributed systems. We develop a new methodology based on concepts of
$q$-Banach algebras of spatially decaying operators that enable us to establish
a relationship between spatial decay properties of spatially decaying systems
and their sparsity and spatial localization features. Moreover, it is shown
that the inverse-closedness property of operator algebras plays a central role
in exploiting various structural properties of spatially decaying systems. We
characterize conditions for exponentially stability of spatially decaying
system over $q$-Banach algebras and prove that the unique solutions of the
Lyapunov and Riccati equations over a proper $q$-Banach algebra also belong to
the same $q$-Banach algebra. It is shown that the quadratically optimal state
feedback controllers for spatially decaying systems are sparse and spatially
localized in the sense that they have near-optimal sparse information

with constant coefficient of normal restitution. We find inhomogeneous states
(IS) where the density profile is spatially non-uniform but constant in time.
The states are exact solutions of non-linear partial differential equations
that describe the coupled distributions of density and temperature when
inelastic losses of energy per collision are small. The derivation is performed
without modelling the equations' coefficients that are unknown in the dense
limit (such as the equation of state), using only their scaling form specific
for hard spheres. The IS is exact non-linear state of this many-body system. It
captures a fundamental property of inelastic collections of particles: the
possibility of preserving non-uniform temperature via the interplay of
inelastic cooling and heat conduction, generalizing previous results in the
dilute case. We perform numerical simulations to demonstrate that arbitrary
initial state evolves to the IS in the limit of long times where the container
has the geometry of the channel. The evolution is like gas-liquid transition.
The liquid condenses in a vanishing part of the total volume but takes most of
the mass of the system. However, the gaseous phase, which mass grows only
logarithmically with the system size, is relevant because its fast particles
carry most of the energy of the system. Remarkably, the system self-organizes
to dissipate no energy: the inelastic decay of energy is a power-law
$[1+t/t_c]^{-2}$ where $t_c$ diverges in the thermodynamic limit. This behavior
is caused by unusual spatial distribution of particles: on approach to one of
the container's walls the density grows inversely with the distance. We discuss
the relation of our results to the recently proposed finite-time singularity in
other container's geometries.

cancellation is proposed. In the method, the analysis prototype filter design
is framed as a convex optimization problem that maximizes the signal-to-alias
ratio (SAR) in the analysis banks. Since each sub-band has a different
bandwidth, the contribution to the overall SAR from each analysis bank is taken
into account during optimization. To increase the degrees of freedom during
optimization, no constraints are imposed on the phase or group delay of the
filters; at the same time, low delay is achieved by ensuring that the resulting
filters are minimum phase. Experimental results show that the filter bank
designed using the proposed method results in a sub-band adaptive filter with a
much better echo return loss enhancement (ERLE) when compared with existing
design methods.

line element that is equal to the operator square root of the quadratic metric
of Riemannian geometry. Since the linear line element is an operator, we treat
it according to the rules of quantum mechanics and interpret its eigenvalues as
physically observable distances; the distance eigenvalues are naturally
quantized. There are both positive and negative eigenvalues, which requires
interpretation. Multi-element curves are defined as direct sums of line
elements, and behave much like systems of spin half electrons in a magnetic
field. For a curve of many elements an entropy and energy and temperature are
quite naturally defined, leading via standard statistical thermodynamics to a
relation between the most probable curve length and temperature. That relation
may be viewed as a universal heat-shrinking property of curves. At this stage
of the theory we do not include bodies or particles in the mix, do not suggest
field equations for the quantum geometry, and questions of interpretation
remain. The theory might conceivably be testable using observations of the
early Universe, when the temperature of space was presumably quite high. In
particular cosmogenesis may be thought of as time stopping at an infinite
temperature as we go backwards in time to the beginning.
