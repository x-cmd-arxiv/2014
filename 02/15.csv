observed properties are likely strong functions of inclination with respect to
our line of sight, yet the specific inclinations of all but a few AGN are
generally unknown. By determining the inclinations and geometries of nearby
Seyfert galaxies using the kinematics of their narrow-line regions (NLRs), and
comparing them with observed properties, we find strong correlations between
inclination and total hydrogen column density, infrared color, and H-beta
full-width at half maximum (FWHM). These correlations provide evidence that the
orientation of AGN with respect to our line of sight affects how we perceive
them, beyond the Seyfert type dichotomy. They can also be used to constrain 3D
models of AGN components such as the broad-line region and torus. Additionally,
we find weak correlations between AGN luminosity and several modeled NLR
parameters, which suggests that the NLR geometry and kinematics are dependent
to some degree on the AGN's radiation field.

${\cal H}$ is considered in a $\infty^2\times L$ slab geometry bounded by a
pair of parallel free surface planes at separation $L$. The
temperature-dependent scaling functions of the excess free energy and the
thermodynamic Casimir force are computed in the large-$n$ limit for
temperatures $T$ at, above, and below the bulk critical temperature $T_{\rm
c}$. Their $n=\infty$ limits can be expressed exactly in terms of the
eigensystem of a self-consistent one-dimensional Schr\""odinger equation. This
equation is solved by numerical means for two distinct discretized versions of
the model: in the first (""model A""), only the coordinate $z$ across the slab is
discretized and the integrations over momenta conjugate to the lateral
coordinates are regularized dimensionally; in the second (""model B""), a simple
cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions along the lateral directions is
used. Renormalization-group ideas are invoked to show that, in addition to
corrections to scaling $\propto L^{-1}$, anomalous ones $\propto L^{-1}\ln L$
should occur. They can be considerably decreased by taking an appropriate
$g\to\infty$ ($T_{\rm c}\to\infty$) limit of the $\phi^4$ interaction constant
$g$. Depending on the model A or B, they can be absorbed completely or to a
large extent in an effective thickness $L_{\rm eff}=L+\delta L$. Excellent data
collapses and consistent high-precision results for both models are obtained.
The approach to the low-temperature Goldstone values of the scaling functions
is shown to involve logarithmic anomalies. The scaling functions exhibit all
qualitative features seen in experiments on the thinning of wetting layers of
${}^4$He and Monte Carlo simulations of $XY$ models, including a pronounced
minimum of the Casimir force below $T_{\rm c}$.

problems in machine learning that can require identifying complex dependencies

ability, in theory, to cope with these temporal dependencies by virtue of the
short-term memory implemented by their recurrent (feedback) connections.
However, in practice they are difficult to train successfully when the
long-term memory is required. This paper introduces a simple, yet powerful
modification to the standard RNN architecture, the Clockwork RNN (CW-RNN), in
which the hidden layer is partitioned into separate modules, each processing
inputs at its own temporal granularity, making computations only at its
prescribed clock rate. Rather than making the standard RNN models more complex,
CW-RNN reduces the number of RNN parameters, improves the performance
significantly in the tasks tested, and speeds up the network evaluation. The
network is demonstrated in preliminary experiments involving two tasks: audio
signal generation and TIMIT spoken word classification, where it outperforms
both RNN and LSTM networks.

amorphous solid water (ASW) is one of the most widely studied molecular
systems. Indeed, ASW is ubiquitous in the cold interstellar medium (ISM), where
ASW-coated dust grains provide a catalytic surface for solid phase chemistry,
and is believed to be present in the Earth's atmosphere at high altitudes. It
has been shown that the ice surface adsorbs small molecules such as CO, N$_2$,
or CH$_4$, most likely at OH groups dangling from the surface. Our study
presents completely new insights concerning the behaviour of ASW upon selective
infrared (IR) irradiation of its dangling modes. When irradiated, these surface
H$_2$O molecules reorganise, predominantly forming a stabilised monomer-like
water mode on the ice surface. We show that we systematically provoke
""hole-burning"" effects (or net loss of oscillators) at the wavelength of
irradiation and reproduce the same absorbed water monomer on the ASW surface.
Our study suggests that all dangling modes share one common channel of
vibrational relaxation; the ice remains amorphous but with a reduced range of
binding sites, and thus an altered catalytic capacity.

region from millimeter to near infrared wavelengths, using the Herschel/Hi-GAL
maps, as well as archival data. RESULTS: From the spectral energy distribution,
we derive a bolometric luminosity of about 4x10^4 Lsun. Our interferometric
observations reveal that the distribution of dense gas and dust in the HMC is
significantly flattened and extends up to a radius of 8000 AU from the center
of radio continuum and maser emission in the region. The equatorial plane of
this HMC is strictly perpendicular to the elongation of the collimated bipolar
outflow, as imaged on scales of about 0.1-0.5 pc in the main CO isotopomers as
well as in the SiO(5-4) line. In the innermost HMC regions (ca. 1000 AU), the
velocity field traced by the CH3CN(12_K-11_K) line emission shows that
molecular gas is both expanding along the outflow direction following a
Hubble-law, and rotating about the outflow axis, in agreement with the (3-D)
velocity field traced by methanol masers. The velocity field associated with
rotation indicates a dynamical mass of 19 Msun at the center of the core. The
latter is likely to be concentrated in a single O9.5 ZAMS star, consistent with
the estimated bolometric luminosity of G023.01-00.41. The physical properties
of the CO(2-1) outflow emission, such as its momentum rate 6x10^-3 Msun km/s
/yr and its outflow rate 2x10^-4 Msun/yr, support our estimates of the
luminosity (and mass) of the embedded young stellar object.

splitting result, we conclude that the present acoustic perturbation is
propagated by the convective wave equation and fulfils Lighthill's acoustic
analogy. Moreover, we can define the deviations of the Navier-Stokes equation
from the convective wave equation as true sound sources. In contrast to other
authors, no assumptions on a slowly varying or irrotational flow are necessary.
Using a symmetry argument for the conservation laws, an energy conservation
result and a generalisation of the sound intensity are provided.

breaking is induced by Abelian gaugings that require the introduction of
self-dual tensor fields accompanying the vectors in the gravity multiplet and
vector multiplets. These tensor fields have first-order kinetic terms and can
become massive by a Stueckelberg-like mechanism. We identify the general class
of N=2 vacua and show how the N=4 spectrum splits into massless and massive N=2
multiplets. In particular, we find a massive gravitino multiplet, containing
two complex massive tensors, and a number of massive tensor multiplets and
hypermultiplets. We determine the resulting N=2 effective action for the
massless multiplets obtained by integrating out massive fields. We show that
the metric and Chern-Simons terms of the vectors are corrected at one-loop by
massive tensors as well as spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 fermions. These contributions
are independent of the supersymmetry-breaking scale and thus have to be
included at arbitrarily low energies.

changes in the choices of theoretical procedure used in the fit. I first
consider using the 3-flavour fixed flavour number scheme instead of the
standard general mass variable flavour number scheme used in the MSTW analysis.
This results in the light quarks increasing at all relatively small $x$ values,
the gluon distribution becoming smaller at high values of $x$ and larger at
small $x$, the preferred value of the coupling constant $\alpha_S(M_Z^2)$
falling, particularly at NNLO, and the fit quality deteriorates. I also
consider lowering the kinematic cut on $W^2$ for DIS data and simultaneously
introducing higher twist terms which are fit to data. This results in much
smaller effects on both PDFs and $\alpha_S(M_Z^2)$ than the scheme change,
except for quarks at very high $x$. I show that the structure function one
obtains from a fixed input set of PDFs using the fixed flavour scheme and
variable flavour scheme differ significantly for $x \sim 0.01$ at high $Q^2$,
and that this is due to the fact that in the fixed flavour scheme there is a
slow convergence of large logarithmic terms of the form
$(\alpha_S\ln(Q^2/m_c^2))^n$ relevant for this regime. I conclude that some of
the most significant differences in PDF sets are largely due to the choice of
flavour scheme used.

so-called zero-determinant strategies. A player adopting zero-determinant
strategies is able to pin the expected payoff of the opponents or to enforce a
linear relationship between his own payoff and the opponents' payoff, in a
unilateral way. This paper considers zero-determinant strategies in the
iterated public goods game, a representative multi-player evolutionary game
where in each round each player will choose whether or not put his tokens into
a public pot, and the tokens in this pot are multiplied by a factor larger than
one and then evenly divided among all players. The analytical and numerical
results exhibit a similar yet different scenario to the case of two-player
games: (i) with small number of players or a small multiplication factor, a
player is able to unilaterally pin the expected total payoff of all other
players; (ii) a player is able to set the ratio between his payoff and the
total payoff of all other players, but this ratio is limited by an upper bound
if the multiplication factor exceeds a threshold that depends on the number of

unclear. We have used growing microcolonies of the bacterium \emph{Escherichia

two-dimensional growth (on the interface between a hard surface and a soft
agarose pad) to three-dimensional growth (invasion of the agarose). We measure
the position within the colony where the invasion transition happens, the cell
density within the colony, and the colony size at the transition as functions
of the concentration of the agarose. We use a phenomenological theory, combined
with individual-based computer simulations, to show how mechanical forces
acting between the bacterial cells, and between the bacteria and the
surrounding matrix, lead to the complex phenomena observed in our experiments -
in particular a non-trivial dependence of the colony size at the transition on
the agarose concentration. Matching these approaches leads to a prediction for
how the friction coefficient between the bacteria and the agarose should vary
with agarose concentration. Our experimental conditions mimic numerous clinical

shedding more general light on the transition between two- and

contains the USNO-B1 proper motions catalog cross-correlated with the
astrometry and near-infrared photometry of the 2MASS Point Source Catalog. To
improve the accuracy of the proper motions, we calculated the average proper
motions of quasars to know their systematic shift from zero in this PPMXL
survey, and we applied the corresponding correction to the proper motions of
the whole survey, which reduces the systematic error. We selected from the CM
diagram K vs. (J-K) the red clump giants and used the information of their
proper motions to build a map of the rotation speed of our Galaxy.
  We obtain an almost flat rotation curve with a slight decrease for higher
values of R or |z|. The most puzzling result is obtained for the farthest
removed and most off-plane regions, where a significant deviation from a null
average proper motion (~4 mas/yr) in the Galactic longitude direction for the

than in the solar Galactocentric radius: an average speed of
82+/-5(stat.)+/-58(syst.) km/s. A scenario with a rotation speed lower than 150
km/s in these regions of our explored zone is intriguing, and invites one to
reconsider different possibilities for the dark matter distribution. However,
given the high systematic errors, we cannot conclude about this. Hence, more
measurements of the proper motions at high R and |z| are necessary to validate
the exotic scenario that would arise if this low speed were confirmed.

become aligned with the field to be about 22 T. The magnetic entropy at 25 K
estimated from the Cp(T) measurements is about $11\%$ smaller than expected,

jets/outflows merely an epiphenomenon associated with star formation or do they
play an important role in mediating the physics of assembling stars both
individually and globally? We address this question by reviewing the current
state of observations and their key points of contact with theory. Our review
of jet/outflow phenomena is organized into three length-scale domains: Source
and Disk Scales ($0.1-10^2$ au) where the connection with protostellar and disk
evolution theories is paramount; Envelope Scales ($10^2-10^5$ au) where the
chemistry and propagation shed further light on the jet launching process, its
variability and its impact on the infalling envelope; Parent Cloud Scales
($10^5-10^6$ au) where global momentum injection into cluster/cloud
environments become relevant. Issues of feedback are of particular importance
on the smallest scales where planet formation regions in a disk may be impacted
by the presence of disk winds, irradiation by jet shocks or shielding by the
winds. Feedback on envelope scales may determine the final stellar mass
(core-to-star efficiency) and envelope dissipation. Feedback also plays an
important role on the larger scales with outflows contributing to turbulent
support within clusters including alteration of cluster star formation
efficiencies (feedback on larger scales currently appears unlikely). A
particularly novel dimension of our review is that we consider results on jet
dynamics from the emerging field of High Energy Density Laboratory Astrophysics
(HEDLA). HEDLA is now providing direct insights into the 3-D dynamics of fully
magnetized, hypersonic, radiative outflows.

of quantum particles into identical indistinguishable copies of the same
quantum many-body state. Quantum indistinguishability (symmetrization) of the
collectivities leads to topological degeneracy in the subspace of elementary
excitations, giving rise to non-Abelian braiding statistics. The non-Abelian
hidden order of a symmetrized structure is manifested in its entanglement
properties, and the corresponding non-Abelian fusion and braiding rules can be
derived by analyzing the set of symmetrized states on a surface with
non-trivial topology like a torus. To illustrate the emergence of non-Abelian
statistics from symmetrization, I consider the case of two identical copies of
the toric code model. The resulting model is shown to be non-Abelian,
exhibiting two types (charge and flux) of quasiparticles with non trivial
fusion channels. The symmetrization construction I present here constitutes a
framework for the generation of non-Abelian models from known Abelian ones.

prominent substructures such as clumps, filaments and velocity gradients,
suggesting that they are still in the midst of rapid construction to grow to
rich clusters at later times. We also estimate dynamical masses of the clusters
and substructures assuming their local virialization. The inferred masses
($\sim$10$^{14}$M$_\odot$) of the protocluster cores are consistent with being
typical progenitors of the present-day most massive class of galaxy clusters
($\sim$10$^{15}$M$_\odot$) if we take into account the typical mass growth
history of clusters. We then calculated the integrated star formation rates of
the protocluster cores normalized by the dynamical masses, and compare these
with lower redshift descendants. We see a marked increase of star-forming
activities in the cluster cores, by almost three orders of magnitude, as we go
back in time to 11 billion years ago; this scales as (1$+$$z$)$^6$.

variations in supply that are likely to arise with increased use of wind and

electricity to exploit variations in electricity spot prices, is becoming an
important way of paying for expensive investments into grid-level storage.
Independent system operators such as the NYISO (New York Independent System
Operator) require that battery storage operators place bids into an hour-ahead
market (although settlements may occur in increments as small as 5 minutes,
which is considered near ""real-time""). The operator has to place these bids
without knowing the energy level in the battery at the beginning of the hour,
while simultaneously accounting for the value of leftover energy at the end of
the hour. The problem is formulated as a dynamic program. We describe and
employ a convergent approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm that
exploits monotonicity of the value function to find a revenue-generating
bidding policy; using optimal benchmarks, we empirically show the computational
benefits of the algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a distribution-free variant
of the ADP algorithm that does not require any knowledge of the distribution of
the price process (and makes no assumptions regarding a specific real-time
price model). We demonstrate that a policy trained on historical real-time
price data from the NYISO using this distribution-free approach is indeed
effective.

  Bicrucial permutations with respect to squares were studied by Avgustinovich
et al., who proved that there exist bicrucial permutations of lengths $8k+1,
8k+5, 8k+7$ for $k\ge 1$. It was left as open questions whether bicrucial
permutations of even length, or such permutations of length $8k+3$ exist. In
this paper, we provide an encoding of orderings which allows us, using the
constraint solver Minion, to show that bicrucial permutations of even length
exist, and the smallest such permutations are of length 32. To show that 32 is
the minimum length in question, we establish a result on left-crucial (that is,
not extendable to the left) square-free permutations which begin with three
elements in monotone order. Also, we show that bicrucial permutations of length
$8k+3$ exist for $k=2,3$ and they do not exist for $k=1$.
  Further, we generalise the notions of right-crucial, left-crucial, and
bicrucial permutations studied in the literature in various contexts, by
introducing the notion of $P$-crucial permutations that can be extended to the
notion of $P$-crucial words. In S-crucial permutations, a particular case of
$P$-crucial permutations, we deal with permutations that avoid prohibitions,
but whose extensions in any position contain a prohibition. We show that
S-crucial permutations exist with respect to squares, and minimal such
permutations are of length 17.
  Finally, using our software, we generate much of relevant data showing, for

understanding the LQG formalism. Having provided a minimal introduction to the
LQG framework, we discuss its applications to the problems of black hole

is presented, which are then tackled one by one in order to convince the reader

instabilities and infrared sensitivity. Instabilities arise, generally
speaking, already in the limit of vanishing electromagnetic constant,
$\alpha_{el}\to 0$. In particular, liquids with non-vanishing chiral chemical
potential might decay into right-left asymmetric states containing vortices.

tomographic approach, by computing the galaxy two-point angular correlation
function $\omega(\theta)$ in thin redshift shells using a
spectroscopic-redshift galaxy survey. The advantages of this procedure are that
it is not necessary to assume a fiducial cosmology in order to convert measured
angular positions and redshifts into distances, and that it gives several (less
accurate) measurements of the angular diameter distance $D_\rm{A}(z)$ instead
of only one (more precise) measurement of the effective average distance
$D_\rm{V}(z)$, which results in better constraints on the expansion history of
the Universe. We test our model for $\omega(\theta)$ and its covariance matrix
against a set of mock galaxy catalogues and show that this technique is able to
extract unbiased cosmological constraints. Also, assuming the best-fit
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology from the cosmic microwave background measurements from
the Planck satellite, we forecast the result of applying this tomographic
approach to the final Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey catalogue in
combination with Planck for three flat cosmological models, and compare them
with the expected results of the isotropic baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
measurements post-reconstruction on the same galaxy catalogue combined with
Planck. While BAOs are more accurate for constraining cosmological parameters
for the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, the tomographic technique gives better
results when we allow the dark energy equation of state $w_{DE}$ to deviate
from $-1$, resulting in a performance similar to BAOs in the case of a constant
value of $w_{DE}$, and a moderate improvement in the case of a time-dependent
value of $w_{DE}$, increasing the value of the Figure-of-Merit in the $w_0-w_a$

excess' below 1keV, whose physical origin remains unclear. Diverse models have
been suggested to account for it, including ionised reflection of X-rays from
the inner part of the accretion disc, ionised winds/absorbers, and
Comptonisation. The ionised reflection model suggests a natural link between
the prominence of the soft excess and the Compton reflection hump strength
above 10keV, but it has not been clear what hard X-ray signatures, if any, are
expected from the other soft X-ray candidate models. Additionally, it has not
been possible up until recently to obtain high-quality simultaneous
measurements of both soft and hard X-ray emission necessary to distinguish
these models, but upcoming joint XMM-NuSTAR programmes provide precisely this
opportunity. In this paper, we present an extensive analysis of simulations of
XMM+NuSTAR observations, using two candidate soft excess models as inputs, to
determine whether such campaigns can disambiguate between them by using hard
and soft X-ray observations in tandem. The simulated spectra are fit with the
simplest ""observer's model"" of a black body and neutral reflection to
characterise the strength of the soft and hard excesses. A plot of the strength
of the hard excess against the soft excess strength provides a diagnostic plot
which allows the soft excess production mechanism to be determined in
individual sources and samples using current state-of-the-art and next
generation hard X-ray enabled observatories. This approach can be
straightforwardly extended to other candidate models for the soft excess.

information gained by updates on the parameter constraints from a series of
experiments which can either complement earlier measurements or replace them.
For this purpose, we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence or relative entropy
from information theory to measure differences in the posterior distributions
in model parameter space from a pair of experiments. We apply this formalism to
a historical series of Cosmic Microwave Background experiments ranging from
Boomerang to WMAP, SPT, and Planck. Considering different combinations of these
experiments, we thus estimate the information gain in units of bits and
distinguish contributions from the reduction of statistical errors and the
`surprise' corresponding to a significant shift of the parameters' central
values. For this experiment series, we find individual relative entropy gains
ranging from about 1 to 30 bits. In some cases, e.g. when comparing WMAP and
Planck results, we find that the gains are dominated by the surprise rather
than by improvements in statistical precision. We discuss how this technique
provides a useful tool for both quantifying the constraining power of data from
cosmological probes and detecting the tensions between experiments.

outskirts of 90 clusters ($1<r/r_{vir}<2$) in the redshift range $0.05<z<0.10$.
Using the line of sight velocity, we selected high and low velocity subsamples.
Theoretical predictions indicate that a significant fraction of the first
subsample should be backsplash galaxies, that is, objects that have already
orbited near the cluster centre. A significant proportion of the sample of high
relative velocity HV galaxies seems to be composed of infalling objects. Our
results suggest that, at fixed stellar mass, late type galaxies in the low
velocity LV sample are systematically older, redder and have formed fewer stars
during the last 3 Gyrs than galaxies in the HV sample. This result is
consistent with models that assume that the central regions of clusters are
effective in quenching the star formation by means of processes such as ram
pressure stripping or strangulation. At fixed stellar mass, LV galaxies show
some evidence of having higher surface brightness and smaller size than HV
galaxies. These results are consistent with the scenario where galaxies that
have orbited the central regions of clusters are more likely to suffer tidal
effects, producing loss of mass as well as a redistribution of matter towards
more compact configurations. Finally, we found a higher fraction of ET galaxies
in the LV sample, supporting the idea that the central region of clusters of

earlier types.

under-estimate the observed 500 microns flux densities, especially for low mass

intensity of the interstellar radiation field (ISRF), the fraction of PAH, the
relative contribution of PDR and evolved stellar population to the dust
heating, the $M_{dust}$ and the $L_{IR}$. For a subsample of gas-rich galaxies,
we analyze the relations between these parameters and the integrated properties
of galaxies, such as $M_*$, SFR, metallicity, H$\alpha$ and H-band surface
brightness, and the FUV attenuation. A good correlation between the fraction of
PAH and the metallicity is found implying a weakening of the PAH emission in
galaxies with low metallicities. The intensity of the IRSF and the H-band and
H$\alpha$ surface brightnesses are correlated, suggesting that the diffuse dust
component is heated by both the young stars in star forming regions and the
diffuse evolved population. We use these results to provide a new set of IR
templates calibrated with Herschel observations on nearby galaxies and a mean
SED template to provide the z=0 reference for cosmological studies. For the

merging/interacting processes play a key role in regulating star formation at

morphology due to high dust extinction. We estimate dust extinction from SEDs.
We find that dust extinction is generally correlated with H$\alpha$ luminosity
and stellar mass (SM). Our results suggest that H$\alpha$ ELGs are
representative of star-forming galaxies (SFGs). Applying extinction correction
for individual objects, we examine the intrinsic H$\alpha$ luminosity function
(LF) at $z=2.24$, obtaining a best-fit Schechter function characterized by a
faint-end slope of $\alpha=-1.3$. This is shallower than the typical slope of
$\alpha \sim -1.6$ in previous works based on constant extinction correction.
We demonstrate that this difference is mainly due to the different extinction
corrections. The proper extinction correction is thus key to recovering the
intrinsic LF as the extinction globally increases with H$\alpha$ luminosity.
Moreover, we find that our H$\alpha$ LF mirrors the SM function of SFGs at the
same cosmic epoch. This finding indeed reflects the tight correlation between
SFR and SM for the SFGs, i.e., the so-called main sequence.

sightline of the background QSO, and a median stellar mass of log(M_star/M_sun)
= 9.7 \pm 1.1. Comparing the absorber features identified in the QSO apectra
with known galaxy properties has led to strong constraints for the CGM
absorption properties at z<~0.176. First, abundant hydrogen gas is observed out
to d~500 kpc, well beyond the dark matter halo radius Rh of individual
galaxies, with a mean covering fraction of ~60%. In contrast, no heavy elements
are detected at d>~0.7 Rh from either low-mass dwarfs or high-mass galaxies.
The lack of detected heavy elements in low- and high-ionization states suggests
that either there exists a chemical enrichment edge at d~0.7 Rh or gaseous
clumps giving rise to the observed absorption lines cannot survive at these
large distances. Considering all galaxies at d>Rh leads to a strict upper limit
for the covering fraction of heavy elements of ~3% (at a 95% confidence level)
over d=(1-9) Rh. At d<Rh, differential covering fraction between low- and
high-ionization gas is observed, suggesting that the CGM becomes progressively
more ionized from d<0.3 Rh to larger distances. Comparing CGM absorption
observations at low and high redshifts shows that at a fixed-fraction of Rh the
CGM exhibits stronger mean absorption at z=2.2 than at z~0. We discuss possible
pseudo-evolution of the CGM as a result of misrepresentation of halo radius.

transform far-infrared spectra were measured from 100 to 300\,K. The measured
phonon densities of states and the infrared spectra showed unusually large
energy shifts with temperature, and large linewidth broadenings. First
principles molecular dynamics (MD) calculations were performed at various
temperatures, successfully accounting for the negative thermal expansion (NTE)
and local dynamics. Using the Fourier-transformed velocity autocorrelation
method, the MD calculations reproduced the large anharmonic effects of Ag$_2$O,
and were in excellent agreement with the neutron scattering data. The
quasiharmonic approximation (QHA) was less successful in accounting for much of
the phonon behavior. The QHA could account for some of the NTE below 250 K,
although not at higher temperatures. Strong anharmonic effects were found for
both phonons and for the NTE. The lifetime broadenings of Ag$_2$O were
explained by anharmonic perturbation theory, which showed rich interactions
between the Ag-dominated modes and the O-dominated modes in both up- and
down-conversion processes.

both objects, putting on solid ground a previous null result for one of the

function consistent with that seen in Lyman Break galaxy (LBG) samples. We
model the redshift evolution of the LAE LF using the LBG UV continuum LF and
the observed rest-frame equivalent width distribution. From the comparison of
our empirical model with the observed LAE distribution, we estimate lower
limits of the neutral hydrogen fraction to be 50-70% at z~7.7. Together with
this, we find a strong evolution in the Ly$\alpha$ optical depth characterized
by (1+z)^(2.2 $\pm$ 0.5) beyond z=6 indicative of a strong evolution of the
IGM. Finally, we extrapolate the LAE LF to z~9 using our model and show that it
is unlikely that large area surveys like UltraVISTA or Euclid pick up LAEs at
this redshift assuming the current depths and area.

  throughout 2014",,,,"cs.GT cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditionally, research focusing on the design of routing and staffing
policies for service systems has modeled servers as having fixed (possibly
heterogeneous) service rates. However, service systems are generally staffed by
people. Furthermore, people respond to workload incentives; that is, how hard a
person works can depend both on how much work there is, and how the work is
divided between the people responsible for it. In a service system, the routing
and staffing policies control such workload incentives; and so the rate servers
work will be impacted by the system's routing and staffing policies. This
observation has consequences when modeling service system performance, and our
objective is to investigate those consequences.
  We do this in the context of the M/M/N queue, which is the canonical model
for large service systems. First, we present a model for ""strategic"" servers
that choose their service rate in order to maximize a trade-off between an
""effort cost"", which captures the idea that servers exert more effort when
working at a faster rate, and a ""value of idleness"", which assumes that servers
value having idle time. Next, we characterize the symmetric Nash equilibrium
service rate under any routing policy that routes based on the server idle
time. We find that the system must operate in a quality-driven regime, in which
servers have idle time, in order for an equilibrium to exist, which implies
that the staffing must have a first-order term that strictly exceeds that of
the common square-root staffing policy. Then, within the class of policies that
admit an equilibrium, we (asymptotically) solve the problem of minimizing the
total cost, when there are linear staffing costs and linear waiting costs.
Finally, we end by exploring the question of whether routing policies that are
based on the service rate, instead of the server idle time, can improve system
performance.

graph theory. We consider a relaxed version of this problem in the setting of
local algorithms. The relaxation is that the constructed subgraph is a sparse
spanning subgraph containing at most $(1+\epsilon)n$ edges (where $n$ is the
number of vertices and $\epsilon$ is a given approximation/sparsity parameter).
In the local setting, the goal is to quickly determine whether a given edge $e$
belongs to such a subgraph, without constructing the whole subgraph, but rather
by inspecting (querying) the local neighborhood of $e$. The challenge is to
maintain consistency. That is, to provide answers concerning different edges
according to the same spanning subgraph. We first show that for general
bounded-degree graphs, the query complexity of any such algorithm must be
$\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. This lower bound holds for constant-degree graphs that have
high expansion. Next we design an algorithm for (bounded-degree) graphs with
high expansion, obtaining a result that roughly matches the lower bound. We
then turn to study graphs that exclude a fixed minor (and are hence
non-expanding). We design an algorithm for such graphs, which may have an
unbounded maximum degree. The query complexity of this algorithm is
$poly(1/\epsilon, h)$ (independent of $n$ and the maximum degree), where $h$ is
the number of vertices in the excluded minor. Though our two algorithms are
designed for very different types of graphs (and have very different
complexities), on a high-level there are several similarities, and we highlight
both the similarities and the differences.

existence of a Nash equilibrium is unknown. Our work provides an exact
characterization of this space for a specific class of scalable and separable
games, which includes a variety of applications such as facility location,
routing, network formation, and coverage games. Given arbitrary local welfare
functions W, we prove that a distribution rule guarantees equilibrium existence
for all games (i.e., all possible sets of resources, agent action sets, etc.)
if and only if it is equivalent to a generalized weighted Shapley value on some
""ground"" welfare functions W', which can be distinct from W. However, if
budget-balance is required in addition to the existence of a Nash equilibrium,
then W' must be the same as W. We also provide an alternate characterization of

appealing from the point of view of computational tractability. A possibly

to work within the class of potential games.

The expected intersection number is universally proportional to the length of
the reference curve, times the wavenumber, independent of the geometry.
  Our main result prescribes the asymptotic behaviour of the nodal
intersections variance for analytic curves in the high energy limit;
remarkably, it is dependent on both the angular distribution of lattice points
lying on the circle with radius corresponding to the given wavenumber, and the
geometry of the given curve. In particular, this implies that the nodal
intersection number admits a universal asymptotic law with arbitrarily high
probability.

extensive study of the supercurrent carried by low energy ABSs in

As previously reported, we find a precipitous drop in the Josephson current at

attributed to a transition where the topologically trivial 2DEG at the surface
is nearly depleted, causing a shift in the spatial location and change in
nature of the helical surface states. We present measurements that support this
picture by revealing qualitative changes in the temperature and magnetic field
dependence of the critical current across this transition. In particular, we
observe pronounced fluctuations in the critical current near total depletion of
the 2DEG that demonstrate the dynamical nature of the supercurrent transport
through topological low energy ABSs.

Establishing such a theorem for the quantum capacity of degradable channels has
been an elusive task, with the strongest progress so far being a so-called

quantum error of any quantum communication scheme for a given degradable
channel converges to a value larger than $1/\sqrt{2}$ in the limit of many

rate exceeding the erasure channel's quantum capacity have a quantum error
tending to one in the limit of many channel uses. Thus, our work adds to the
body of evidence that a fully strong converse theorem should hold for the
quantum capacity of the erasure channel. As a side result, we prove that the
classical capacity of the quantum erasure channel obeys the strong converse

that the improvement is principally due to the suppression of the inhomogeneous

the bare YIG nano-disks, the broadening is associated to a damping constant
$\alpha = 4 \cdot 10^{-4}$. A 3 fold increase of the linewidth is observed for
the series with Pt cap layer, attributed to the spin pumping effect. The

structured prior knowledge (e.g. protein interaction networks) show promise in
helping to define better signatures but most knowledge remains unstructured.
  Crowdsourcing via scientific discovery games is an emerging methodology that
has the potential to tap into human intelligence at scales and in modes
previously unheard of. Here, we developed and evaluated a game called The Cure
on the task of gene selection for breast cancer survival prediction. Our
central hypothesis was that knowledge linking expression patterns of specific
genes to breast cancer outcomes could be captured from game players. We
envisioned capturing knowledge both from the players prior experience and from
their ability to interpret text related to candidate genes presented to them in
the context of the game.
  Results: Between its launch in Sept. 2012 and Sept. 2013, The Cure attracted
more than 1,000 registered players who collectively played nearly 10,000 games.
Gene sets assembled through aggregation of the collected data clearly
demonstrated the accumulation of relevant expert knowledge. In terms of
predictive accuracy, these gene sets provided comparable performance to gene
sets generated using other methods including those used in commercial tests.

densities, resulting in fewer sources predicted for future surveys with the SKA

RMs to study clusters of galaxies or individual galaxies. Most of the polarized
sources are well above our detection limit, and are radio galaxies which are
well-resolved even at 10"", with redshifts from $\sim$0.2 - 1.9. We determined a
total polarized flux for each source by integrating the 10"" polarized intensity
maps, as will be done by upcoming surveys such as POSSUM. These total polarized

The detected sources have rotation measures (RMs) with a characteristic rms
scatter of $\sim$11$\frac{rad}{m^2}$ around the local Galactic value, after
eliminating likely outliers. The median fractional polarization from all total
intensity sources does not continue the trend of increasing at lower flux

buoy deployed off Goa in deep water and far away from the shore. The data were
collected for 4 years from February 1998 to February 2002. A simple feed
forward type of network trained using a variety of algorithms was used. The
input nodes selected by trial were three in number and belonged to the segment
of preceding observations while the output node was single and it consisted of
the predicted value of the wind speed over the subsequent 3, 6 and 12 hours one
at a time. The number of hidden nodes was based on trials. The total sample was
divided into a training set (first 70 percent) and a testing set (remaining 30
percent). The outcome of the network was compared with the actual observations
with the help of scatter diagrams and time history plots as well as through the
error statistics of the correlation coefficient, R, and mean square error, MSE.
The testing of the network showed that it predicted the wind speed in a very
satisfactory manner with R = 0.99 and MSE = 0.30 (m/s)2 for a 3 hour ahead
prediction while these values for a 12 hour ahead predictions were 0.96 and
1.19 (m/s)2, respectively. Such a prediction based on neural network was found
to be superior to that based on polynomial fittings as well as ARMA models.
ARIMA models were also used but the predicted values showed significant lag.

markets, where agents arrive and depart stochastically and the network of
acceptable transactions among agents forms a random graph. We analyze our model
from three perspectives: waiting, optimization, and information. The main
insight of our analysis is that waiting to thicken the market can be
substantially more important than increasing the speed of transactions, and
this is quite robust to the presence of waiting costs. From an optimization
perspective, naive local algorithms, that choose the right time to match agents
but do not exploit global network structure, can perform very close to optimal
algorithms. From an information perspective, algorithms that employ even
partial information on agents' departure times perform substantially better
than those that lack such information. To elicit agents' departure times, we
design an incentive-compatible continuous-time dynamic mechanism without
transfers.

Here, we report the third way of thermal-electric conversion beyond Seebeck and

temperature difference, the-third-way converts the time-dependent ambient
temperature fluctuation into electricity, similar to the behavior of
pyroelectricity. However, the-third-way is also distinct from pyroelectric

general conducting systems. We demonstrate that the-third-way results from the

across varieties, regions, years of vintage, alcohol content, price and expert

whether a combination of explanatory variables can predict outcome variables
using data on selected 2710 Australian wines rates by the latest book of James
Halliday1. We analysed two dependent (outcome) variables, namely the rating and
the price, and their (non-linear) relationship between explanatory variables
and each other. We observe that the rating scale is not linear, as consumers
may believe, and that a narrow range of rating scores is used for the
ascertained wines. Across all wines, approximately 20% of variation in
log(Price) can be explained by the explanatory factors state, variety, vintage
and alcohol percentage. If the residuals from the model for rating is also
taken as an explanatory variable for price, then a total of 53% of variation in
log(Price) is explained by the model. For those wines ascertained to be in
Halliday1, there is more variability between white wines than between red wines
that is explained by explanatory variables such as State and variety. In
comparison with hedonic pricing analyses in previous studies on French and
Australian wines, a smaller proportion of variation in price and rating was
explained in Australian wines that were in the 2014 edition of Halliday.

this method is somehow complicated specially at nonzero temperature. Using the
proximity force approximation (PFA) helps to achieve the lateral Casimir force
in a truly explicit manner. We assume the cylinders to be slightly eccentric
with similar radiuses and separations much smaller than corrugations' wave
length for the validity of PFA. For such short distances the effect of finite
conductivity would be non negligible. In addition to the effect of finite
conductivity, we investigate thermal corrections of the lateral Casimir force
to reduce the inaccuracy of the result obtained by PFA. Assuming the Casimir
force density between two parallel plates, the normal Casimir force between two
cylinders is obtained. With the aid of additive summation of the Casimir energy
between cylinders without corrugation, we obtain the lateral Casimir force

novel method is proposed for the parameter estimation in the case where belief
structures are uncertain and represented as interval-valued belief structures.
Within our proposed method, the maximization of likelihood criterion and
minimization of estimated parameter's uncertainty are taken into consideration
simultaneously. As an illustration, the proposed method is employed to estimate
parameters for deterministic and uncertain belief structures, which
demonstrates its effectiveness and versatility.

based on the interactions between the individuals that compose the system. It
is assumed that the individuals interact cooperatively and competitively. As a
consequence of this interaction, it is shown that some well-known
phenomenological population growth models (such as the Malthus, Verhulst,
Gompertz, Richards, Von Foerster, and power-law growth models) are special
cases of the model presented herein. Moreover, other ecological behaviors can
be seen as the emergent behavior of such interactions. For instance, the Allee
effect, which is the characteristic of some populations to increase the
population growth rate at a small population size, is observed. Whereas the
models presented in the literature explain the Allee effect with
phenomenological ideas, the model presented here explains this effect by the
interactions between the individuals. The model is tested with empirical data
to justify its formulation. Other interesting macroscopic emergent behavior
from the model proposed here is the observation of a regime of population
divergence at a finite time. It is interesting that this characteristic is
observed in humanity's global population growth. It is shown that in a regime
of cooperation, the model fits very well to the human population growth data
since 1000 A.D.

unrealistic for gas giant planets. Later models of compressible rotating
convection obtained only few high latitude jets which were not amenable to

  Here we present 3-D numerical simulations of compressible convection in

  All of our simulations show a strong prograde equatorial jet outside the

$\mathcal{H}$. We investigate when the natural embedding $\mathcal{H} \to D^b
\mathcal{A}$ can be extended to a triangle equivalence $D^b \mathcal{H} \to D^b
\mathcal{A}$. Our focus of study is the case where $\mathcal{A}$ is the
category of finite-dimensional modules over a finite-dimensional hereditary
algebra. In this case, we prove that such an extension exists if and only if
the $t$-structure is bounded and the aisle $\mathcal{U}$ of the $t$-structure
is closed under the Serre functor.

risk caused by counter party failure using liabilities and assets to define
banks' balance sheet. In our stylized system, banks can be in two states:
normally operating or distressed and the state of a bank changes from normally
operating to distressed whenever its liabilities are larger than the banks'
assets. The banks are connected through an interbank lending network and,
whenever a bank is distressed, its creditor cannot expect the loan from the
distressed bank to be repaid, potentially becoming distressed themselves. We
solve the problem analytically for a homogeneous system and test the robustness
and generality of the results with simulations of more complex systems. We
investigate the parameter space and the corresponding distribution of operating
banks mapping the conditions under which the whole system is stable or
unstable. This allows us to determine how financial stability of a banking
system is influenced by regulatory decisions, such as leverage; we discuss the
effect of central bank actions, such as quantitative easing and we determine
the cost of rescuing a distressed banking system using re-capitalisation.
Finally, we estimate the stability of the UK and US banking systems in the
years 2007 and 2012 showing that both banking systems were more unstable in
2007 and connectedness on the interbank market partly caused the banking

classic paper of 1932. This is clearly impossible because the discovery of the
neutron by Chadwick was submitted more than one month after Landau's work.
Therefore, and according to his calculations, what Landau really did was to
study white dwarfs, and the critical mass he obtained clearly matched the value
derived by Stoner and later by Chandrasekhar. The birth of the concept of a
neutron star is still today unclear. Clearly, in 1934, the work of Baade and
Zwicky pointed to neutron stars as originating from supernovae. Oppenheimer in
1939 is also well known to have introduced general relativity (GR) in the study
of neutron stars. The aim of this note is to point out that the crucial idea
for treating the neutron star has been advanced in Newtonian theory by Gamow.
However, this pioneering work was plagued by mistakes. The critical mass he
should have obtained was $6.9\,M_\odot$, not the one he declared, namely, $1.5\
M_\odot$. Probably, he was taken to this result by the work of Landau on white
dwarfs. We revise Gamow's calculation of the critical mass regarding
calculational and conceptual aspects and discuss whether it is justified to
consider it the first neutron-star critical mass. We compare Gamow's approach
to other early and modern approaches to the problem.

K-shell absorption in the nearby ($z=0.184$) quasar PDS456. From a recent long
Suzaku observation in 2013 ($\sim1$Ms effective duration) we find that the the
equivalent width of iron K absorption increases by a factor of $\sim5$ during
the observation, increasing from $<105$eV within the first 100ks of the
observation, towards a maximum depth of $\sim500$eV near the end. The implied
outflow velocity of $\sim0.25$c is consistent with that claimed from earlier
(2007, 2011) Suzaku observations. The absorption varies on time-scales as short
as $\sim1$ week. We show that this variability can be equally well attributed
to either (i) an increase in column density, plausibly associated with a clumpy
time-variable outflow, or (ii) the decreasing ionization of a smooth
homogeneous outflow which is in photo-ionization equilibrium with the local
photon field. The variability allows a direct measure of absorber location,
which is constrained to within $r=200-3500$$\rm{r_{g}}$ of the black hole. Even
in the most conservative case the kinetic power of the outflow is $\gtrsim6\%$
of the Eddington luminosity, with a mass outflow rate in excess of $\sim40\%$
of the Eddington accretion rate. The wind momentum rate is directly equivalent
to the Eddington momentum rate which suggests that the flow may have been
accelerated by continuum-scattering during an episode of Eddington-limited
accretion.

cover a wide parameter space and do not seem to cluster around any preferential
values. Comparing the rest-frame optical, X-ray and high-energy properties of
the larger sample of non-RS-dominated GRBs, we show that the early-time ($<$

energy output of our reverse-shock dominated sample do not differ significantly
from the general population at early times. However, the GRBs with dominant
reverse shock emission have fainter than average optical forward-shock emission
at late time ($>$ 10 ks). We find that GRBs with an identifiable reverse shock

approach, based on the solution of the Boltzmann-Langevin equation in three

has a broad applicability for dissipative fermionic dynamics. We study the
occurrence of bifurcations in the dynamical trajectories describing heavy-ion
collisions at Fermi energies.
  The model, applied to dilute systems formed in such collisions, reveals to be
closer to the observation than previous attempts to include a Langevin term in
Boltzmann theories. The onset of bifurcations and bimodal behaviour in
dynamical trajectories, determines the fragment-formation mechanism. In
particular, in the proximity of a threshold, fluctuations between two
energetically favourable mechanisms stand out, so that when evolving from the
same entrance channel, a variety of exit channels is accessible.
  This description gives quantitative indications about two threshold
situations which characterise heavy-ion collisions at Fermi energies. First,
the fusion-to-multifragmentation threshold in central collisions, where the
system either reverts to a compact shape, or splits into several pieces of
similar sizes. Second, the transition from binary mechanisms to neck
fragmentation (in general, ternary channels), in peripheral collisions.

key factor to retaining the existence in the highly competitive global market.
Problems of manual fabric defect inspection are lack of accuracy and high time
consumption, where early and accurate fabric defect detection is a significant
phase of quality control. Computer vision based, i.e. automated fabric defect
inspection systems are thought by many researchers of different countries to be
very useful to resolve these problems. There are two major challenges to be
resolved to attain a successful automated fabric defect inspection system. They
are defect detection and defect classification. In this work, we discuss
different techniques used for automated fabric defect classification, then show
a survey of classifiers used in automated fabric defect inspection systems, and
finally, compare these classifiers by using performance metrics. This work is
expected to be very useful for the researchers in the area of automated fabric
defect inspection to understand and evaluate the many potential options in this
field.
