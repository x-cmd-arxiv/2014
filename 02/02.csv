furnace. Powder x-ray diffraction of the as grown crystal revealed that PrSi
crystallizes in FeB$-$type structure with space group $Pnma$ (no. 62). PrSi
undergoes a ferromagnetic transition at 52 K with [010] direction as the easy
axis of magnetization. Heat capacity data confirm the bulk nature of the
transition at 52 K and exhibit a huge anomaly at the transition. A sharp rise
in the low temperature heat capacity has been observed (below 5 K) which is
attributed to the $^{141}$Pr nuclear Schottky heat capacity arising from the
hyperfine field of the Pr moment. The estimated Pr magnetic moment 2.88
$\mu_{\rm B}$/Pr from the hyperfine splitting is in agreement with the
saturation magnetization value obtained from the magnetization data measured at
2 K. From the crystal electric field (CEF) analysis of the magnetic
susceptibility, magnetization and the heat capacity data it is found that the
degenerate $J = 4$ Hund's rule derived state of Pr$^{3+}$-ion splits into nine
singlets with an overall splitting of 284 K, the first excited singlet state
separated by just 9 K from the ground state. The magnetic ordering in PrGe
appears to be due to the exchange generated admixture of low lying crystal
field levels. Magnetocaloric effect (MCE) has been investigated from
magnetization data along all the three principal crystallographic directions.
Large magnetic entropy change, $-\Delta S_M = $22.2 J/kg K, and the relative
cooling power, RCP = $460$ J/kg, characteristic of giant magneto caloric effect
are achieved near the transition temperature ($T_{\rm C}$ = 52 K) for $H =$~70
kOe along $[010]$. Furthermore, the PrSi single crystal exhibits a giant MCE
anisotropy.

problem of recovering missing Fourier coefficients, particularly in some non
standard situations were low frequency coefficients are lost. In the framework
of non-local regularization, we propose a technique to build an original
patchwise similarity measure that is adapted to the missing spectrum. Then, a
simple Non-Local quadratic energy is minimized. By construction, the similarity
criterion is invariant under the corruption process so that the distance
between two patches of the corrupted image is almost exactly equal to the one
computed on the clean image. We illustrate our method with experiments which
show its efficiency, both in terms of speed and quality of the results, with
respect to other common approaches. We show that the method is practical on
synthetic examples which are built upon models of inverse scattering problems,
synthetic aperture mirrors for spatial imaging or also medical imaging.

accounts for multiple evolutions. With the aid of a bi-coloured 2d- tree, a

fluid-composite structure interaction. The benchmark problem proposed here
consists of an incompressible, viscous fluid interacting with a composite
structure that consists of two layers: a thin elastic layer which is in contact
with the fluid, and a thick elastic layer which sits on top of the thin layer.
The motivation comes from fluid-structure interaction (FSI) in hemodyam- ics.
The equations of linear elasticity are used to model the thick structural
layer, while the Koiter member/shell equations are used to model the thin
structural layer which serves as fluid-structure interface with mass. An effi-
cient, modular, operator-splitting scheme is proposed to simulate solutions to
the coupled, nonlinear FSI problem. The operator splitting scheme sepa- rates
the elastodynamics structure problem, from a fluid problem in which the thin
structure inertia is included as a Robin-type boundary condition to achieve
unconditional stability, without requiring any sub-iterations within
time-steps. An energy estimate associated with unconditional stability is
derived for the fully nonlinear FSI problem defined on moving domains. Two
instructive numerical examples are presented to test the performance of the
scheme, where it is shown numerically, that the scheme is at least first-order
accurate in time. The second example reveals a new phenomenon in FSI problems:
the presence of a thin fluid-structure interface with mass regularizes
solutions to the full FSI problem.

This is the Quantum Zeno
Effect (QZE). Repeatedly asking a quantum system ""are you still in your initial

Zeno Dynamics (QZD) leaves more freedom to the system. Instead of pinning it to
a single state, it sets a border in its evolution space. Repeatedly asking the
system ""did you cross the border?"" makes it impenetrable. Since the border can
be designed at will by choosing the measured observable, QZD allows one to
tailor the system's evolution space. Recent proposals, particularly in the

QZD in the 51-dimension Hilbert space of a large angular momentum J = 25.
Continuous selective interrogation limits the evolution of this angular
momentum to an adjustable multi-dimensional subspace. This confined dynamics
leads to the production of non-classical ""Schr\""odinger cat"" states, quantum
superpositions of angular momentums pointing in different directions. These
states are promising for sensitive metrology of electric and magnetic fields.
This QZD approach could be generalized to other systems, opening novel

affect the star formation positively and negatively. In this paper, we review
the complexity of investigations aiming at understanding the interchange
between supernova explosions with the star-forming molecular clouds. Commencing
from analytical studies the paper advances to numerical models of supernova
feedback from superbubble scales to galaxy structure. We also discuss
parametrizations of star-formation and supernova-energy transfer efficiencies.
Since evolutionary models from the interstellar medium to galaxies are numerous
and are applying multiple recipes of these parameters, only a representative
selection of studies can be discussed here.

methods of network science has proven fruitful in a variety of areas, including
applications in political science and more narrowly the field of international
relations. We propose a new line of research in the study of international
conflict by showing that the multiplex fractionalization of the international
system (which we label Kantian fractionalization) is a powerful predictor of
the propensity for violent interstate conflict, a key indicator of the system's
stability. In so doing, we also demonstrate the first use of multislice
modularity for community detection in a multiplex network application. Even
after controlling for established system-level conflict indicators, we find
that Kantian fractionalization contributes more to model fit for violent
interstate conflict than previously established measures. Moreover, evaluating
the influence of each of the constituent networks shows that joint democracy
plays little, if any, role in predicting system stability, thus challenging a
major empirical finding of the international relations literature. Lastly, a
series of Granger causal tests shows that the temporal variability of Kantian
fractionalization is consistent with a causal relationship with the prevalence
of conflict in the international system. This causal relationship has
real-world policy implications as changes in Kantian fractionalization could
serve as an early warning sign of international instability.

assuming a mass accretion rate of 1.E-8 to 1.E-7 Sollar mass/yr for 44yrs, it
has been concluded that the white dwaf in T Pyx is actually losing mass. Using
NLTE disk modeling spectra to fit our recently obtained Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) COS and STIS spectra, we find a mass accretion rate of up to two orders
of magnitude larger than previously estimated. Our larger mass accretion rate
is due mainly to the newly derived distance of T Pyx (4.8kpc; Sokoloski et al.
2013, larger than the previous 3.5kpc estimate), our derived reddening of
E(B-V)=0.35 (based on combined IUE and GALEX spectra) and NLTE disk modeling
(compared to black body and raw flux estimates in earlier works). We find that
for most values of the reddening (0.25 < E(B-V) < 0.50) and white dwaf mass
(0.70 to 1.35 Sollar mass) the accreted mass is larger than the ejected mass.
Only for a low reddening (0.25 and smaller) combined with a large white dwaf
mass (0.9 sollar mass and larger) is the ejected mass larger than the accreted
one. However, the best spectral fitting results are obtained for a larger value

Outside the period affected by this volcano, the atmospheric transparency
exhibited a stable behavior with a slight negative trend without any

demonstrates that Einstein once explored a cosmic model in which the mean
density of matter in an expanding universe is maintained constant by the
continuous formation of matter from empty space. This model is very different
to previously known Einsteinian models of the cosmos (both static and dynamic)
but anticipates the later steady-state cosmology of Hoyle, Bondi and Gold in
some ways. We find that Einstein's steady-state model contains a fundamental
flaw and suggest that it was abandoned for this reason. We also suggest that he
declined to explore a more sophisticated version because he found such theories
rather contrived. The manuscript is of historical interest because it reveals
that Einstein debated between steady-state and evolving models of the cosmos
decades before a similar debate took place in the cosmological community.

accomplished by existing methods: to test DIE/DIU with respect to a continuous
covariate, and to test DIE/DIU for one case versus one control. The latter task
is not an uncommon situation in practice, e.g., comparing paternal and maternal
allele of one individual or comparing tumor and normal sample of one cancer
patient. Simulation studies demonstrate the high sensitivity and specificity of
IsoDOT. We apply IsoDOT to study the effects of haloperidol treatment on mouse
transcriptome and identify a group of genes whose isoform usages respond to
haloperidol treatment.

differences among various types of trade agreements and full-fledged trade

not moderated by democracy. This paper analyses the impact of heterogeneous
TAs, and their interaction with domestic institutions, on FDI inflows.

this argument. The method adopted relies on fixed effects estimator which is
robust to control endogeneity on a large panel dataset. The strict erogeneity

are complementary to democratic regime whereas the conditional effect of PSA
with democracy on levels of FDI inflows is insignificant.

comparisons between potential outcomes under treatment and control. To infer
causal effects from randomized experiments, Neyman proposed to test the null
hypothesis of zero average causal effect (Neyman's null), and Fisher proposed
to test the null hypothesis of zero individual causal effect (Fisher's null).
Although the subtle difference between Neyman's null and Fisher's null has
caused lots of controversies and confusions for both theoretical and practical
statisticians, a careful comparison between the two approaches has been lacking
in the literature for more than eighty years. We fill in this historical gap by
making a theoretical comparison between them and highlighting an intriguing
paradox that has not been recognized by previous researchers. Logically,
Fisher's null implies Neyman's null. It is therefore surprising that, in actual
completely randomized experiments, rejection of Neyman's null does not imply
rejection of Fisher's null for many realistic situations, including the case
with constant causal effect. Furthermore, we show that this paradox also exists
in other commonly-used experiments, such as stratified experiments,
matched-pair experiments, and factorial experiments. Asymptotic analyses,
numerical examples, and real data examples all support this surprising
phenomenon. Besides its historical and theoretical importance, this paradox
also leads to useful practical implications for modern researchers.

monotonically from birth to death. Since the 19th century, this concept is one
of the cornerstones and in the same time puzzles of statistical mechanics. On
the other hand, there is the empirical experience where one witnesses the
emergence, growth and diversification of new self-organized objects with
ever-increasing complexity. When modeling them in terms of simple discrete
elements one finds that the emergence of collective complex adaptive objects is
a rather generic phenomenon governed by a new type of laws. These 'emergence'
laws, not connected directly with the fundamental laws of the physical reality,
nor acting 'in addition' to them but acting through them were called by Phil
Anderson 'More is Different', 'das Maass' by Hegel etc. Even though the
'emergence laws' act through the intermediary of the fundamental laws that
govern the individual elementary agents, it turns out that different systems
apparently governed by very different fundamental laws: gravity, chemistry,
biology, economics, social psychology, end up often with similar emergence laws
and outcomes. In particular the emergence of adaptive collective objects endows
the system with a granular structure which in turn causes specific macroscopic
cycles of intermittent fluctuations.

decomposed into four Lorentzian peaks with different Raman frequency shifts
attributable to four individual scattering paths in the energy-momentum space.
From our polarization dependence study, however, we reveal that each of the
four different peaks is actually doubly degenerate in its scattering channels,
i.e., two different scattering paths with similar Raman frequency shifts for
each peak. We find theoretically that one of these two paths, ignored for a
long time, has a small contribution to their scattering intensities but are
critical in understanding their polarization dependences. Because of this, the
maximum-to-minimum intensity ratios of the four peaks show a strong dependence
on the excitation energy, unlike the case of single-layer graphene (SLG). Our
findings thus reveal another interesting aspect of electron-phonon interactions

many attempts have been made to distinguish the C*-algebras and von Neumann
algebras in more general classes of abstractly defined Jordan algebras (JB- and
JBW-algebras). One particularly important distinguishing property was
identified by Alfsen and Shultz and is the existence of a dynamical
correspondence. It reproduces the dual role of the selfadjoint operators as
observables and generators of dynamical groups in quantum mechanics. In the
paper, this concept is extended to another class of nonassociative algebras,
arising from recent studies of the quantum logics with a conditional
probability calculus and particularly of those that rule out third-order
interference. The conditional probability calculus is a mathematical model of
the Lueders-von Neumann quantum measurement process, and third-order
interference is a property of the conditional probabilities which was
discovered by R. Sorkin in 1994 and which is ruled out by quantum mechanics. It
is shown then that the postulates that a dynamical correspondence exists and
that the square of any algebra element is positive still characterize, in the
class considered, those algebras that emerge from the selfadjoint parts of
C*-algebras equipped with the Jordan product. Within this class, the two
postulates thus result in ordinary quantum mechanics using the complex Hilbert
space or, vice versa, a genuine generalization of quantum theory must omit at
least one of them.

role as observables, generators of the dynamical groups and statistical
operators defining the mixed states. One might expect that this is typical of
Hilbert space quantum mechanics, but it is not. The same triple role occurs for
the elements of a certain ordered Banach space in a much more general theory
based upon quantum logics and a conditional probability calculus (which is a
quantum logical model of the Lueders-von Neumann measurement process). It is
shown how positive groups, automorphism groups, Lie algebras and statistical
operators emerge from one major postulate - the non-existence of third-order
interference (third-order interference and its impossibility in quantum
mechanics were discovered by R. Sorkin in 1994). This again underlines the
power of the combination of the conditional probability calculus with the
postulate that there is no third-order interference. In two earlier papers, its
impact on contextuality and nonlocality had already been revealed.

over a similarity graph constructed by a pool of RF candidates. However,

nontrivial problem. Hence, we introduce a similarity metric called
pyramid-error distance (PED) to measure their pairwise distances through
summing up pyramid-like matching errors over a set of low-level features.

in the main belt and produced hydrated minerals on the altered asteroids. The
aqueous alteration is particularly important for unraveling the processes
occurring during the earliest times of the Solar System history, as it can give
information both on the asteroids thermal evolution and on the localization of
water sources in the asteroid belt. We present new spectral observations in the
visible region of 80 asteroids belonging to the primitive classes C, G, F, B
and P. We combine the present observations with the visible spectra of
asteroids available in the literature for a total of 600 primitive main belt
asteroids. Our analysis shows that the aqueous alteration sequence starts from
the P-type objects, practically unaltered, and increases through the F, B, C,
and G asteroids. Around 50% of the observed C-type asteroids show absorption
features in the vis. range due to hydrated silicates, implying that more than
70% of them will have a 3 $\mu$m absorption band and thus hydrated minerals on
their surfaces. The process dominates in primitive asteroids located between
2.3 and 3.1 AU, that is at smaller heliocentric distances than previously
suggested. The aqueous alteration process dominates in the 50--240 km sized
primitive asteroids, while it is less effective for bodies smaller than 50 km.
No correlation is found between the aqueous alteration process and the
asteroids albedo or orbital elements. Comparing the $\sim$ 0.7 $\mu$m band
parameters of hydrated silicates and CM2 carbonaceous chondrites, we see that
the band center of meteorites is at longer wavelengths than that of asteroids.
This difference on center positions may be attributed to different minerals
abundances, and to the fact that CM2 available on Earth might not be
representative of the whole aqueous altered asteroids population.

by sequential supernova explosions in star forming regions, which carve out
large holes in the interstellar medium and eject hot, metal enriched gas into
the halo and to the galactic neighborhood. We investigate the evolution of
superbubbles in exponentially stratified disks. We present advanced analytical
models for the expansion of such bubbles and calculate their evolution in space
and time. With these models one can derive the energy input that is needed for
blow-out of superbubbles into the halo and derive the break-up of the shell,
since Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities develop soon after a bubble starts to
accelerate into the halo. The approximation of Kompaneets is modified in order
to calculate velocity and acceleration of a bubble analytically. Our new model
differs from earlier ones, because it presents for the first time an analytical
calculation for the expansion of superbubbles in an exponential density
distribution driven by a time-dependent energy input rate. The time-sequence of
supernova explosions of OB-stars is modeled using their main sequence lifetime
and an initial mass function. We calculate the morphology and kinematics of
superbubbles powered by three different kinds of energy input and we derive the
energy input required for blow-out as a function of the density and the scale
height of the ambient interstellar medium. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability
timescale in the shell is calculated in order to estimate when the shell starts
to fragment and finally breaks up. Analytical models are a very efficient tool
for comparison to observations, like e.g. the Local Bubble and the W4 bubble
discussed in this paper, and also give insight into the dynamics of superbubble
evolution.

unified point of view based on the Landau crystallization theory. To simulate
the capsid structures we map the planar pentagonal Penrose quasilattice (PPQ)
constructed in the frames of the Landau theory onto a sphere through the
dodecahedron nets of different sizes. Six different simplest nets containing
from 60 to 360 positions occupied by proteins are proposed. Buckling of the
initially planar capsid faces and a smooth conjugation of the protein orders at
the adjacent faces are taken into account by means of two conditions imposed on
the minimization of the capsid free energy. This conditional minimization
results in two-component phason strain field, which describes the
self-consistent reconstruction of quasicrystalline orders located at twelve
faces of spherical dodecahedron. All six chiral structures obtained in this way
are very similar to those of well-known spherical viral capsids. The theory
proposed explains some general peculiarities of protein organization in capsids
of small and medium-sized viruses.

investigate the energy densities and fluxes in the freely falling frames for
the Boulware, Unruh, and Israel-Hartle-Hawking states. In particular, we study
their behaviors near the horizon and asymptotic spatial infinity by using the
trace anomaly of a conformally invariant scalar field. In the Boulware state,
both the energy density and flux are negative divergent when the observer is
dropped at the horizon, and asymptotically vanish. In the Unruh state, the
energy density is also negative divergent at the horizon while it is positive
finite asymptotically. The flux in the Unruh state is always positive and
divergent at the horizon. In the Israel-Hartle-Hawking state, the energy
density depends on the angular motion of free fall, and fluxes vanish at the
horizon and the spatial infinity. Finally, we discuss the role of the negative
energy density near the horizon in the evaporating black hole.

  of Surface Waves",,,"10.1093/mnras/stu813",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  At intermediate and high degree $l$, solar p- and f modes can be considered
as surface waves. Using variational principle, we derive an integral expression
for the group velocities of the surface waves in terms of adiabatic
eigenfunctions of normal modes, and address the benefits of using
group-velocity measurements as a supplementary diagnostic tool in solar
seismology. The principal advantage of using group velocities, when compared
with direct analysis of the oscillation frequencies, comes from their smaller
sensitivity to the uncertainties in the near-photospheric layers. We address
some numerical examples where group velocities are used to reveal
inconsistencies between the solar models and the seismic data. Further, we
implement the group-velocity measurements to the calibration of the specific
entropy, helium abundance Y and heavy-element abundance Z in the
adiabatically-stratified part of the solar convective envelope, using different
recent versions of the equation of state. The results are in close agreement
with our earlier measurements based on more sophisticated analysis of the solar
oscillation frequencies (Vorontsov et al. 2013, MNRAS 430, 1636). These results
bring further support to the downward revision of the solar heavy-element
abundances in recent spectroscopic measurements.

of proton can not be taken proportional. This is in contradiction with the
widely used relation between these two properties of the proton. This apparent
difficulty is addressed by the most elementary notions of the relevant physics.
In particular it is emphasized that the widely used relation is only valid in
the lowest orders of perturbation, in which transitions between different
baryons do not occur. For other processes where such transitions do occur, such
as inelastic scattering off the protons, the quark model relation for the
magnetic moment is used to give an estimation for the amplitude of transition
between states with different total spins.

quartic parameter controls solutions very similarly to the cubic parameter,
allowing for the construction of a theory with another free parameter which may
find meaning in the phase transition behaviour of a gauge/gravity context.

presented. The proposal is anchored in the objective realist, stochastic
formulation of quantum mechanics wherein the Planck constant plays the role of
a diffusion constant which need not be an universal constant for all epochs.
This underlying noise is charecterised by a very high initial value of the
Planck constant which gradually decreased over the epochs gone by, finally
reaching its present value .It is this decrease in the strength of the Planck
constant that causes a spectral red shift with the passage of time .The
compatibility of this proposal with some cosmological data is shown.Feasible
spectroscopic measurement of a specific spectral line frequency done over a
period of a few years can decisively either validate or invalidate the proposal
in a terrestrially bound experiment. This proposal predicts a slowing down of
atomic clocks by nearly 2. 10^-18 s with respect to every preceding second. A
positive experimental outcome will validate the objective realist basis of
quantum physics as advocated by Einstein and many others.

result in powerful AI drives that may pose an existential risk to human
society. We analyze this scenario and find the underlying assumptions to be
unlikely. We examine the alternative scenario of what happens when universal
goals that are not human-centric are used for designing AI agents. We follow a
design approach that tries to exclude malevolent motivations from AI agents,
however, we see that objectives that seem benevolent may pose significant risk.
We consider the following meta-rules: preserve and pervade life and culture,
maximize the number of free minds, maximize intelligence, maximize wisdom,
maximize energy production, behave like human, seek pleasure, accelerate
evolution, survive, maximize control, and maximize capital. We also discuss
various solution approaches for benevolent behavior including selfless goals,
hybrid designs, Darwinism, universal constraints, semi-autonomy, and
generalization of robot laws. A ""prime directive"" for AI may help in
formulating an encompassing constraint for avoiding malicious behavior. We
hypothesize that social instincts for autonomous robots may be effective such
as attachment learning. We mention multiple beneficial scenarios for an
advanced semi-autonomous AGI agent in the near future including space
exploration, automation of industries, state functions, and cities. We conclude
that a beneficial AI agent with intelligence beyond human-level is possible and
