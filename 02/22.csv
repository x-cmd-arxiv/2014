superconducting proximity effects between a segment of a nanowire with a p-wave
order parameter and a metallic segment. This model faithfully represents key
qualitative features of an experimental setup, where only a part of a nanowire
is in immediate contact with a bulk superconductor, inducing topological
superconductivity. It is shown that the Eilenberger equations represent a
viable alternative to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory of the topological
superconducting heterostructures and provide a much simpler quantitative
description of some observables. For our setup, we obtain exact analytical
solutions for the quasiclassical Green's functions and the density of states as
a function of position and energy. The correlations induced by the boundary
involve terms associated with both p-wave and odd-frequency pairing, which are
intertwined and contribute to observables on an equal footing. We recover the
signatures of the standard Majorana mode near the end of the superconducting
segment, but find no such localized mode induced in the metallic segment.
Instead, the zero-bias feature is spread out across the entire metallic part in
accordance with the previous works. In shorter wires, the Majorana mode and
delocalized peak split up away from zero energy. For long metallic segments,
non-topological Andreev bound states appear and eventually merge together,
giving rise to a gapless superconductor.

field solution from the constraints of the transverse photospheric field, this
new code uses coronal constraints instead, and this way provides important
information on systematic errors of each magnetic field calculation method, as
well as on the non-forcefreeness in the lower chromosphere. In this study we
applied the COR-NLFFF code to active region NOAA 11158, during the time
interval of 2011 Feb 12 to 17, which includes an X2.2 GOES-class flare plus 35
M and C-class flares. We calcuated the free magnetic energy with a 6-minute
cadence over 5 days. We find good agreement between the two types of codes for
the total nonpotential $E_N$ and potential energy $E_P$, but find up to a
factor of 4 discrepancy in the free energy $E_{free}=E_N-E_P$, and up to a
factor of 10 discrepancy in the decrease of the free energy $\Delta E_{free}$
during flares. The coronal NLFFF code exhibits a larger time variability, and
yields a decrease of free energy during the flare that is sufficient to satisfy
the flare energy budget, while the photospheric NLFFF code shows much less time
variability and an order of magnitude less free energy decrease during flares.
The discrepancy may partly be due to the pre-processing of photospheric vector
data, but more likely due to the non-forcefreeness in the lower chromosphere.
We conclude that the coronal field cannot be correctly calculated based on
photospheric data alone, but requires additional information on coronal loop
geometries.

us to study when, where, and why active region loops form, and how they evolve.
We use a 3D radiation MHD simulation of the emergence of an active region
through the upper convection zone and the photosphere as a lower boundary for a
3D MHD coronal model. The latter accounts for the braiding of the magnetic
fieldlines, which induces currents in the corona heating up the plasma. We
synthesize the coronal emission for a direct comparison to observations.
Starting with a basically field-free atmosphere we follow the filling of the
corona with magnetic field and plasma. Numerous individually identifiable hot
coronal loops form, and reach temperatures well above 1 MK with densities
comparable to observations. The footpoints of these loops are found where small
patches of magnetic flux concentrations move into the sunspots. The loop
formation is triggered by an increase of upwards-directed Poynting flux at
their footpoints in the photosphere. In the synthesized EUV emission these
loops develop within a few minutes. The first EUV loop appears as a thin tube,
then rises and expands significantly in the horizontal direction. Later, the
spatially inhomogeneous heat input leads to a fragmented system of multiple
loops or strands in a growing envelope.

Outer bounds on the secrecy rate are also derived, using a novel partitioning
of the encoded messages and outputs depending on the relative strength of the
signal and the interference. The inner and outer bounds are derived under all
possible parameter settings. It is found that, for some parameter settings, the
inner and outer bounds match, yielding the capacity of the SLDIC under
transmitter cooperation and secrecy constraints. In some other scenarios, the
achievable rate matches with the capacity region of the 2-user SLDIC without
secrecy constraints derived by Wang and Tse [1]; thus, the proposed scheme
offers secrecy for free, in these cases. Inspired by the achievable schemes and
outer bounds in the deterministic case, achievable schemes and outer bounds are
derived in the Gaussian case. The proposed achievable scheme for the Gaussian
case is based on Marton's coding scheme and stochastic encoding along with
dummy message transmission. One of the key techniques used in the achievable
scheme for both the models is interference cancelation, which simultaneously
offers two seemingly conflicting benefits: it cancels interference and ensures
secrecy. Many of the results derived in this paper extend to the asymmetric
case also.

  Sampling Method for Prediction of Antituberculosis Activity","published 2013",,,,"cs.LG stat.AP stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  In this paper, a new descriptor selection method for selecting an optimal
combination of important descriptors of sulfonamide derivatives data, named
self tuned reweighted sampling (STRS), is developed. descriptors are defined as
the descriptors with large absolute coefficients in a multivariate linear
regression model such as partial least squares(PLS). In this study, the
absolute values of regression coefficients of PLS model are used as an index
for evaluating the importance of each descriptor Then, based on the importance
level of each descriptor, STRS sequentially selects N subsets of descriptors
from N Monte Carlo (MC) sampling runs in an iterative and competitive manner.
In each sampling run, a fixed ratio (e.g. 80%) of samples is first randomly
selected to establish a regresson model. Next, based on the regression
coefficients, a two-step procedure including rapidly decreasing function (RDF)
based enforced descriptor selection and self tuned sampling (STS) based
competitive descriptor selection is adopted to select the important
descriptorss. After running the loops, a number of subsets of descriptors are
obtained and root mean squared error of cross validation (RMSECV) of PLS models
established with subsets of descriptors is computed. The subset of descriptors
with the lowest RMSECV is considered as the optimal descriptor subset. The
performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by sulfanomide derivative
dataset. The results reveal an good characteristic of STRS that it can usually
locate an optimal combination of some important descriptors which are
interpretable to the biologically of interest. Additionally, our study shows
that better prediction is obtained by STRS when compared to full descriptor set
PLS modeling, Monte Carlo uninformative variable elimination (MC-UVE).

stars in this mass range. This small fraction is not explained by the fossil
field paradigm that describes the Ap/Bp type magnetism as a remnant of an early
phase of the star-life. Also, the limitation of the field measurements to a
small and special group of stars is obviously a problem to study the effect of
the magnetic fields on the stellar evolution of a typical intermediate-mass

  Thanks to the improved sensitivity of a new generation of
spectropolarimeters, a lower bound to the magnetic fields of Ap/Bp stars, a two
orders of magnitude desert in the longitudinal magnetic field and a new type of
sub-gauss magnetism first discovered on Vega have been identified. These
advances provide new clues to understand the origin of intermediate-mass

scenario has been proposed whereby the magnetic dichotomy between Ap/Bp and
Vega-like magnetism originate from the bifurcation between stable and unstable
large scale magnetic configurations in differentially rotating stars. In this

emission component is contributing to the observed spectrum of many GRBs. One
important question is whether the photosphere component can interpret the
typical ``Band'' function of GRBs with a typical low energy photon spectral
index $\alpha \sim -1$. We perform a detailed study of the photosphere emission
spectrum by progressively introducing several physical ingredients previously
not fully incorporated, including the probability distribution of the location
of a dynamically evolving photosphere, superposition of emission from an
equal-arrival-time ``volume'' in a continuous wind, the evolution of optical
depth of a wind with finite but evolving outer boundary, as well as the effect
of different top-hat wind luminosity ($L_w$) profiles. By assuming a co-moving
blackbody spectrum emerging from the photosphere, we find that for an outflow
with a constant or increasing $L_w$, the low-energy spectrum below the peak
energy ($E_{p}$), can be modified to $F_\nu \sim \nu^{1.5}$ ($\alpha \sim
+0.5$). A softer ($-1<\alpha<+0.5$) or flat ($\alpha=-1$) spectrum can be
obtained during the $L_w$ decreasing phase or high-latitude-emission-dominated
phase. We also study the evolution of $E_{p}$ as a function of wind and
photosphere luminosity in this photosphere model. An $E_p-L$ tracking pattern
can be reproduced if a certain positive dependence between the dimensionless
entropy $\eta$ and $L_w$ is introduced. However, the hard-to-soft evolution

questioned and lack properties that are desirable. Probabilistic
trace-distribution equivalence differentiates systems that can perform the same
set of traces with the same probabilities, and is not a congruence for parallel
composition. Probabilistic testing equivalence, which relies only on extremal
success probabilities, is backward compatible with testing equivalences for
restricted classes of processes, such as fully nondeterministic processes or
generative/reactive probabilistic processes, only if specific sets of tests are
admitted. In this paper, new versions of probabilistic trace and testing
equivalences are presented for the general class of nondeterministic and
probabilistic processes. The new trace equivalence is coarser because it
compares execution probabilities of single traces instead of entire trace
distributions, and turns out to be compositional. The new testing equivalence
requires matching all resolutions of nondeterminism on the basis of their
success probabilities, rather than comparing only extremal success
probabilities, and considers success probabilities in a trace-by-trace fashion,
rather than cumulatively on entire resolutions. It is fully backward compatible
with testing equivalences for restricted classes of processes; as a
consequence, the trace-by-trace approach uniformly captures the standard
probabilistic testing equivalences for generative and reactive probabilistic
processes. The paper discusses in full details the new equivalences and
provides a simple spectrum that relates them with existing ones in the setting

Recent works show that the degree distribution of these graphs encapsulates
much information on the signals variability, and therefore constitutes a
fundamental feature for statistical learning purposes. However, exact solutions
for the degree distributions are only known in a few cases, such as for
uncorrelated random processes. Here we analytically explore these distributions
in a list of situations. We present a diagrammatic formalism which computes for
all degrees their corresponding probability as a series expansion in a coupling
constant which is the number of hidden variables. We offer a constructive
solution for general Markovian stochastic processes and deterministic maps. As
case tests we focus on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, fully chaotic and
quasiperiodic maps. Whereas only for certain degree probabilities can all
diagrams be summed exactly, in the general case we show that the perturbation
theory converges. In a second part, we make use of a variational technique to
predict the complete degree distribution for special classes of Markovian
dynamics with fast-decaying correlations. In every case we compare the theory
with numerical experiments.

femtosecond relativistic pulses to produce quasimonoenergetic bunches with
controllable peak energy. The RITA scheme works by a relativistic laser
inducing transparency to densities higher than the cold-electron critical
density, while the background heavy ions are stationary. The rising laser pulse
creates a traveling acceleration structure at the relativistic critical density
by ponderomotively driving a local electron density inflation, creating an
electron snowplow and a co-propagating electrostatic potential. The snowplow
advances with a velocity determined by the rate of the rise of the laser's
intensity envelope and the heavy-ion-plasma density gradient scale length. The
rising laser is incrementally rendered transparent to higher densities such
that the relativistic-electron plasma frequency is resonant with the laser
frequency. In the snowplow frame, trace density protons reflect off the
electrostatic potential and get snowplowed, while the heavier background ions
are relatively unperturbed. Quasimonoenergetic bunches of velocity equal to
twice the snowplow velocity can be obtained and tuned by controlling the
snowplow velocity using laser-plasma parameters. An analytical model for the
proton energy as a function of laser intensity, rise time, and plasma density
gradient is developed and compared to 1D and 2D PIC OSIRIS simulations. We
model the acceleration of protons to GeV energies with tens-of-femtoseconds

settings, i.e., the unconditionally secure and the computationally secure

Recently, Freire, Paterson and Poettering proposed strong key

than KI-security in such a setting. In this paper we consider the
unconditionally secure setting for hierarchical key assignment schemes. In such
a setting the security of the schemes is not based on specific unproven
computational assumptions, i.e., it relies on the theoretical impossibility of
breaking them, despite the computational power of an adversary coalition. We
prove that, in this setting, SKI-security is not stronger than KI-security,

(interfacial) energies. The least action principle (or the principle of virtual
work) is applied to derive the conservative part of the dynamics, with a focus
on the reversible part of the stress tensor arising from the mixing energies.
The dissipative part of the dynamics is then introduced through a dissipation
function in the energy law, in line with the Onsager principle of least energy
dissipation. The final system, formed by a set of coupled time-dependent
partial differential equations, reflects a balance among various conservative
and dissipative forces and governs the evolution of velocity and phase fields.
To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, a few two-dimensional
simulations have been carried out, including (1) the force balance at the
three-phase contact line in equilibrium, (2) a rising bubble penetrating a
fluid-fluid interface, and (3) a solid particle falling in a binary fluid. The

several different ways in the recent literature. However, the relationship

employing the concept of assisted knowledge, where the environment E, acquires
information about a system S, by means of its measurement apparatus A. The
assisted knowledge, based on the accessible information in terms of von-Neumann
entropy, monotonically increases in time for all Markovian quantum processes.
We demonstrate that the signatures of non-Markovianity can be captured by the
nonmonotonic behaviour of the assisted knowledge. We explore this scenario for
a two-level system undergoing a relaxation process, through an experimental
implementation using an optical approach that allows full access to the state

matching to the boundary theory defined on S^1 x S^{d-1}, where the length of
S^1 may be interpreted as the inverse temperature. It has been shown that the
large N limit of the partition function on S^1 x S^2 in the U(N) singlet sector
of the CFT of N free complex scalars matches the one-loop thermal partition
function of the Vasiliev theory in AdS_4, while in the O(N) singlet sector of
the CFT of N real scalars it matches the minimal theory containing even spins
only. We extend this matching to all dimensions d. We also calculate partition
functions for the singlet sectors of free fermion CFT's in various dimensions
and match them with appropriately defined higher spin theories, which for d>3
contain massless gauge fields with mixed symmetry. In the zero-temperature case
R x S^{d-1} we calculate the Casimir energy in the scalar or fermionic CFT and
match it with the one-loop correction in the global AdS_{d+1}. For any
odd-dimensional CFT the Casimir energy must vanish on general grounds, and we
show that the HS duals obey this. In the U(N) symmetric case, we exhibit the
vanishing of the regularized 1-loop Casimir energy of the dual HS theory in
AdS_{d+1}. In the minimal HS theory the vacuum energy vanishes for odd d while
for even d it is equal to the Casimir energy of a single conformal scalar in R
x S^{d-1} which is again consistent with AdS/CFT, provided the minimal HS
coupling constant is ~ 1/(N-1). We demonstrate analogous results for singlet

therefore of major interest in science. Weakly bound clusters can be studied
using conventional spectroscopic techniques, but the number of lines observed

generates rotational wavepackets, which provides simultaneous information on
structure and dynamics, as has been demonstrated successfully for isolated
molecules. Here, we apply this technique for the firsttime to clusters
comprising of a molecule and a single helium atom. By forcing the population of
high rotational levels in intense laser fields we demonstrate the generation of
rich rotational line spectra for this system, establishing the highly

variations thereof become stronger, the motivation to explore supersymmetric
models that challenge some of the standard assumptions of the MSSM also become
stronger. For example, models where the gauginos are Dirac instead of Majorana
have recently received more attention. Beside allowing for a supersoft SUSY
breaking mechanism where the gauginos only provide finite threshold corrections
to scalar masses, the cross section for the production of a squark pairs is
reduced. In addition, Dirac gauginos can be used to build models that possess a
U(1)R symmetry. This symmetry can then be identified with a lepton number,
leading to models that are quite different from conventional scenarios. The
sneutrinos in these models can acquire a vev and give mass to the leptons and
the down-type squark. The phenomenology is novel, combining signatures that are
typical of R-parity violating scenarios with signatures arising from
leptoquarks. Correspondingly the constraints from electroweak precision data
are also different. In these models, one of the leptons mixes with gauginos and
superpotential Yukawa couplings can contribute to EWPM at tree level. In
addition, lepton universality is broken. In this paper we adapt the operators
analysis of Han and Skiba [1] to include the relevant violation of lepton
universality, and do a global fit of the model to electroweak precision data,
including all relevant tree-level and loop-level effects. We obtain bounds on

establish a multi-modes representation of the solution as a power series of the

this multi-modes representation, we develop a Monte Carlo interior penalty
discontinuous Galerkin (MCIP-DG) method for approximating the mode functions,
which are governed by recursively defined nearly deterministic Helmholtz
equations. Optimal order error estimates are derived for the method and an
efficient algorithm, which is based on the LU direct solver, is also designed
for efficiently implementing the proposed multi-modes MCIP-DG method. It is
proved that the computational complexity of the whole algorithm is comparable
to that of solving one deterministic Helmholtz problem using the LU director
solver. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical results
and to gauge the performance of the proposed numerical method and algorithm.

reconciliation of ideas across contexts, it differs in that each disciplinary
idea is considered canonically correct within its own discipline. The setting
for the research is an introductory physics course for biology majors that
seeks to build greater interdisciplinary coherence and therefore includes
biologically relevant topics such as ATP and chemical bond energy. In our
case-study data, students grapple with the apparent contradiction between the
energy released when the phosphate bond in ATP is broken and the idea that an
energy input is required to break a bond. We see students justifying
context-dependent modeling choices, showing nuance in articulating how system

desired endpoint of IDR, in which students can build coherent connections
between concepts from different disciplines while understanding each concept in

Jupiter (Mp=1.12MJ, Rp=1.363RJ) orbiting a K2V star, which has a possible
gravitationally-bound M-dwarf companion at 0.6 arcsec separation contributing
~20 percent of the total flux in the observed J-band light curve. The planet is
only 1.5 times the separation from its host star at which it would be destroyed
by Roche lobe overflow, and has a predicted remaining lifetime of just ~40 Myr,
assuming a tidal dissipation quality factor of Q'*=10^6. Q'* is a key factor in
determining how frictional processes within a host star affect the orbital
evolution of its companion giant planets, but it is currently poorly
constrained by observations. We calculate that the orbital decay of WTS-2 b
would correspond to a shift in its transit arrival time of T_shift~17 seconds
after 15 years assuming Q'*=10^6. A shift less than this would place a direct
observational constraint on the lower limit of Q'* in this system. We also
report a correction to the previously published expected T_shift for WASP-18 b,
finding that T_shift=356 seconds after 10 years for Q'*=10^6, which is much
larger than the estimated 28 seconds quoted in WASP-18 b discovery paper. We
attempted to constrain Q'* via a study of the entire population of known
transiting hot Jupiters, but our results were inconclusive, requiring a more
detailed treatment of transit survey sensitivities at long periods. We conclude
that the most informative and straight-forward constraints on Q'* will be
obtained by direct observational measurements of the shift in transit arrival
times in individual hot Jupiter systems. We show that this is achievable across
the mass spectrum of exoplanet host stars within a decade, and will directly
probe the effects of stellar interior structure on tidal dissipation.

simulations with energy-dependent, 3-flavor neutrino transport, the
lepton-number flux (nue minus antinue) emerges predominantly in one hemisphere.
This novel, spherical-symmetry breaking neutrino-hydrodynamical instability is
termed LESA for ""Lepton-number Emission Self-sustained Asymmetry."" While the
individual nue and antinue fluxes show a pronounced dipole pattern, the
heavy-flavor neutrino fluxes and the overall luminosity are almost spherically
symmetric. Initially, LESA seems to develop stochastically from convective
fluctuations, it exists for hundreds of milliseconds or more, and it persists
during violent shock sloshing associated with the standing accretion shock
instability. The nue minus antinue flux asymmetry originates mainly below the
neutrinosphere in a region of pronounced proto-neutron star (PNS) convection,
which is stronger in the hemisphere of enhanced lepton-number flux. On this
side of the PNS, the mass-accretion rate of lepton-rich matter is larger,
amplifying the lepton-emission asymmetry, because the spherical stellar infall
deflects on a dipolar deformation of the stalled shock. The increased shock
radius in the hemisphere of less mass accretion and minimal lepton-number flux
(antinue flux maximum) is sustained by stronger convection on this side, which
is boosted by stronger neutrino heating because the average antinue energy is
higher than the average nue energy. Asymmetric heating thus supports the global
deformation despite extremely nonstationary convective overturn behind the
shock. While these different elements of LESA form a consistent picture, a full
understanding remains elusive at present. There may be important implications
for neutrino-flavor oscillations, the neutron-to-proton ratio in the
neutrino-heated supernova ejecta, and neutron-star kicks, which remain to be
explored.

robust retrieval and anti-piracy search. While much of the existing research
has focused on extracting robust and secure content descriptors, a significant
open challenge still remains: Most existing video hashing methods are fallible
to temporal desynchronization. That is, when the query video results by
deleting or inserting some frames from the reference video, most existing
methods assume the positions of the deleted (or inserted) frames are either
perfectly known or reliably estimated. This assumption may be okay under
typical transcoding and frame-rate changes but is highly inappropriate in
adversarial scenarios such as anti-piracy video search. For example, an illegal
uploader will try to bypass the 'piracy check' mechanism of YouTube/Dailymotion
etc by performing a cleverly designed non-uniform resampling of the video. We
present a new solution based on dynamic time warping (DTW), which can implement
automatic synchronization and can be used together with existing video hashing
methods. The second contribution of this paper is to propose a new robust
feature extraction method called flow hashing (FH), based on frame averaging
and optical flow descriptors. Finally, a fusion mechanism called distance
boosting is proposed to combine the information extracted by DTW and FH.
Experiments on real video collections show that such a hash extraction and
comparison enables unprecedented robustness under both spatial and temporal
attacks.

and reviews recent experiments using this technique. These are discussed in

Raman scattering. The success of these studies has motivated the development of
several new RIXS spectrometers at synchrotrons around the world that promise,
among other improvements, 5-10 times better energy resolution. We finish by
outlining several key areas which hold promise for further important
discoveries in this emerging field.

the tension between the locally measured value of the Hubble rate, and the
'global' value inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This could
be due to systematic uncertainties when measuring $H_0$ locally, or it could be
that we live in a highly unlikely Hubble bubble, or other exotic scenarios. We
point out that the global $H_0$ can be found by extrapolating $H(z)$ data
points at high-$z$ down to $z=0$. By doing this in a Bayesian non-parametric
way we can find a model-independent value for $H_0$. We apply this to 19
measurements based on differential age of passively evolving galaxies as cosmic
chronometers. Using Gaussian processes, we find $H_0=64.9 \pm 4.2$ km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$ $(1\sigma)$, in agreement with the CMB value, but reinforcing the
tension with the local value. An analysis of possible sources of systematic
errors shows that the stellar population synthesis model adopted may change the
results significantly, being the main concern for subsequent studies. Forecasts
for future data show that distant $H(z)$ measurements can be a robust method to
determine $H_0$, where a focus in precision and a careful assessment of
systematic errors are required.

programming: each solution to a problem is represented by a stable model of a

Several implementations now exist for stable logic programming, and their
performance is rapidly improving. To make SLP generally applicable, it should
be possible to check for consistency (i.e., existence of stable models) of the
input program before attempting to answer queries. In the literature, only
rather strong sufficient conditions have been proposed for consistency, e.g.,
stratification. This paper extends these results in several directions. First,
the syntactic features of programs, viz. cyclic negative dependencies,
affecting the existence of stable models are characterized, and their relevance
is discussed. Next, a new graph representation of logic programs, the Extended
Dependency Graph (EDG), is introduced, which conveys enough information for
reasoning about stable models (while the traditional Dependency Graph does
not). Finally, we show that the problem of the existence of stable models can
be reformulated in terms of coloring of the EDG.

infinitely grows. In the domain where it reaches the Planckian value and
exceeds it the Einstein equations should be modified. In the absence of
reliable theory of quantum gravity it is instructive to consider simplified
models. We assume that a spacetime curvature is limited by some value (of the
order of the Planckian one). We use modified Vaidya metric, proposed by
Hayward, to describe the black hole evaporation process. In such a spacetime
the curvature near $r=0$ remains finite, it does not have an event horizon and
its apparent horizon is closed. If the initial mass of such a `black hole' is
much larger than the Planckian one its properties (as seen by an external
observer) are practically the same as properties of the `standard' black hole
with the event horizon. We study outgoing null rays in the vicinity of the
outer apparent and introduce a notion of quasi-horizon. We demonstrate that
particles, trapped inside a `black hole' during the evaporation process,
finally may return to external space after the evaporation is completed. We
also demonstrate that such quanta would have very large blue-shift. The absence
of the event horizon makes it possible restoration of the unitarity in
evaporating black holes.

non-linear transformations. Unfortunately, different phenotypes require
different specific transformations, and choosing a ""good"" transformation is in

that using such optimal transformations lead to increased power in genome-wide

accommodates contact switching and makes no assumptions about gait or terrain,
making it applicable on any humanoid platform for use in any task. The filter
employs a sensor-based prediction model which uses inertial data from an IMU

performed on both the original and updated filters and it is concluded that the

Hecke characters are used to construct $G(F/K)$-equivariant
Stickelberger-splitting maps in the $l$-primary Quillen localization sequence
for $F$, extending the results obtained in 1990 by Banaszak for $K = \Bbb Q$.
We also apply the Stickelberger-splitting maps to construct special elements in

module structure of the group $D(n)_l$ of divisible elements in $K_{2n}(F)_l$,

the classical conjecture of Iwasawa on class groups of cyclotomic fields and
its potential generalization to a wider class of number fields. Finally, if $F$

Euler systems in the odd $K$-groups with coefficients $K_{2n+1}(F, \Bbb

Metric Tensor is the tool by which one describes the desired level of mesh
anisotropy. In contrast a mesh redistribution method based on the Monge-Ampere

require the explicit construction of a Metric Tensor, although one always
exists. An interesting question is whether such a method produces an
anisotropic mesh. To answer this question we consider the general metric to
which an optimally transported mesh aligns. We derive the exact metric,
involving expressions for its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, for a model linear
feature. The eigenvectors of are shown to be orthogonal and tangential to the
feature, and the ratio of the eigenvalues is shown to depend, both locally and
globally, on the value of the scalar density function. We thereby demonstrate
how an optimal transport method produces an anisotropic mesh along a given

Numerical results for a Parabolic Monge-Ampere moving mesh method are included

persistently dominated by heteroclinic tangencies and by Newhouse phenomena,

high value functions such as fettling, die-finishing, deburring, and
fixtureless manufacturing. For achieving this goal, past work has concentrated
on force control algorithms at the system level with limited focus on
performance expansion at the actuator level. We present a comprehensive
literature review on robot force control, including algorithms, specialized
actuators, and robot control software. A robot force control testbed was
developed using Schunk's PowerCube 6-DOF Arm and a six-axis ATI force/torque
sensor. Using parameter identification experiments, manipulator module inertias
and the motor torque constant were estimated. Experiments were conducted to
study the practical issues involved in implementing stable contact transitions
and programmable endpoint impedance. Applications to human augmentation,
virtual fixtures, and teleoperation are discussed. These experiments are used
as a vehicle to understand the performance improvement achievable at the
actuator level. The approach at UTRRG has been to maximize the choices within
the actuator to enhance its intelligence. Drawing on this 20-year research
history in electromechanical actuator architecture, we propose a new concept
that mixes two inputs, distinct in their velocity ratios, within the same dual
actuator called a Force/Motion Actuator (FMA). Detailed kinematic and dynamic
models of this dual actuator are developed. The actuator performance is
evaluated using simulations with an output velocity specification and resolving
input trajectories using a minimum-norm solution. It is shown that a design
choice of 14:1 motion scaling between the two inputs results in good
sensitivity to output force disturbances without compromising velocity tracking
performance.

to the shock around {\it Fermi} pulsar PSR J1741$-$2054, we now report
H$\alpha$ structures around two additional $\gamma$-ray pulsars, PSR J2030+4415
and PSR J1509$-$5850. These are the first known examples of H$\alpha$ nebulae
with pre-ionization halos. With new measurements, we show that a simple
analytic model can account for the angular size and flux of the bow shocks'
apices. The latter, in particular, provides a new pulsar probe and indicates
large moments of inertia and smaller distances than previously assumed, in
several cases. In particular we show that the re-measured PSR J0437$-$4715

design for linear time-invariant systems. It is shown that control
specifications in time domain and in frequency domain are always mutually
exclusive determined by uncertainty relations. The uncertainty principle from
quantum mechanics and harmonic analysis therefore embeds itself inherently in
control theory. The relations among transient specifications, system bandwidth
and control energy are obtained within the framework of uncertainty principle.
If the control system is provided with a large bandwidth or great control

a control system could be approximated by prolate spheroidal wave functions.
The obtained results are also applicable to filter design due to the duality of

reflecting our practical experience with the data available in applications of

direct effect on costs/revenues, such as demand or returns, but predominantly
of observations of associated auxiliary quantities. The main problem of
interest is a conditional stochastic optimization problem, given imperfect
observations, where the joint probability distributions that specify the
problem are unknown. We demonstrate that our proposed solution methods, which
are inspired by ML methods such as local regression, CART, and random forests,
are generally applicable to a wide range of decision problems. We prove that
they are tractable and asymptotically optimal even when data is not iid and may
be censored. We extend this to the case where decision variables may directly
affect uncertainty in unknown ways, such as pricing's effect on demand. As an
analogue to R^2, we develop a metric P termed the coefficient of

of a policy from an operations perspective. To demonstrate the power of our

large data set, the observed pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) do not show a uniform
behavior and the main parameters driving features like luminosity,
magnetization, and others are still not fully understood. To evaluate the
possible existence of common evolutive trends and to link the characteristics
of the nebula emission with those of the powering pulsar, we selected a sub-set
of 10 TeV detections which are likely ascribed to young PWNe and model the
spectral energy distribution with a time-dependent description of the nebulae's
electron population. In 9 of these cases, a detailed PWNe model, using
up-to-date multiwavelength information, is presented. The best-fit parameters
of these nebula are discussed, together with the pulsar characteristics. We
conclude that TeV PWNe are particle-dominated objects with large
multiplicities, in general far from magnetic equipartition, and that relatively
large photon field enhancements are required to explain the high level of
Comptonized photons observed. We do not find significant correlations between
the efficiencies of emission at different frequencies and the magnetization.
The injection parameters do not appear to be particularly correlated with the
pulsar properties either. We find that a normalized comparison of the SEDs

been studied in great detail. However, the power of standard information for

are derivable. For several important systems, like modal logic S5, failure of
structural completeness is caused only by the underivability of passive rules,
i.e. rules that can not be applied to theorems of the system. Neglecting
passive rules leads to the notion of almost structural completeness, that
means, derivablity of admissible non-passive rules. Almost structural
completeness for quasivarieties and varieties of general algebras is
investigated here by purely algebraic means. The results apply to all
algebraizable deductive systems.
  Firstly, various characterizations of almost structurally complete
quasivarieties are presented. Two of them are general: expressed with finitely
presented algebras, and with subdirectly irreducible algebras. One is
restricted to quasivarieties with finite model property and equationally
definable principal relative congruences, where the condition is verifiable on
finite subdirectly irreducible algebras.
  Secondly, examples of almost structurally complete varieties are provided
Particular emphasis is put on varieties of closure algebras, that are known to
constitute adequate semantics for normal extensions of S4 modal logic. A
certain infinite family of such almost structurally complete, but not
structurally complete, varieties is constructed. Every variety from this family
has a finitely presented unifiable algebra which does not embed into any free
algebra for this variety. Hence unification in it is not unitary. This shows
that almost structural completeness is strictly weaker than projective
unification for varieties of closure algebras.

$k_{T}$ factorization theorem. All the infrared divergences regulated by the
logarithms $\ln(k_{iT}^{2})$ cancel between those from the quark diagrams and
from the effective diagrams for the initial $B$ meson wave function and the
final pion meson wave function. An infrared finite NLO hard kernel is therefore
obtained, which confirms the application of the $k_{T}$ factorization theorem
to $B$ meson semileptonic decays at twist-3 level. From our analytical and
numerical evaluations, we find that the NLO twist-3 contributions to the form
factors $f^{+,0}(q^2)$ of $B \to \pi$ transition are similar in size, but have
an opposite sign with the NLO twist-2 contribution, which leads to a large
cancelation between these two NLO parts. For the case of $f^+(0)$, for example,
the $24\%$ NLO twist-2 enhancement to the full LO prediction is largely
canceled by the negative ( about $-17\%$ ) NLO twist-3 contribution, leaving a
small and stable $7\%$ enhancement to the full LO prediction in the whole range
of $0\leq q^2\leq 12$ GeV$^2$. At the full NLO level, the perturbative QCD
prediction is $F^{B \to \pi}(0)=0.269^{+0.054}_{-0.050}$. We also studied the
possible effects on the pQCD predictions when different sets of the B meson and
pion distribution amplitudes are used in the numerical evaluation.

Microwave Background (CMB) data. However, the model has well known problems.
For example, the cosmological constant, is fine-tuned to 1 part in 10^100 and
the cold dark matter (CDM) particle is not yet detected in the laboratory.
Shanks previously investigated a model which assumed neither exotic particles
nor a cosmological constant but instead postulated a low Hubble constant (H_0)
to allow a baryon density compatible with inflation and zero spatial curvature.
However, recent Planck results make it more difficult to reconcile such a model
with CMB power spectra. Here we relax the previous assumptions to assess the
effects of assuming three active neutrinos of mass ~5eV. If we assume a low
H_0~45kms^-1Mpc^-1 then, compared to the previous purely baryonic model, we
find a significantly improved fit to the first 3 peaks of the Planck power
spectrum. Nevertheless, the goodness-of-fit is still significantly worse than
for LCDM and would require appeal to unknown systematic effects for the fit
ever to be considered acceptable. A further serious problem is that the
amplitude of fluctuations is low (sigma_8~0.2) making it difficult to form
galaxies by the present day. This might then require seeds, perhaps from a
primordial magnetic field, to be invoked for galaxy formation. These and other
problems demonstrate the difficulties faced by models other than LCDM in
fitting ever more precise cosmological data.

pulsar wind shocks with this material just above the surface of the companion.
We discuss various observational properties of this shock, including radio
eclipses, orbitally modulated X-ray emission, and the potential for
$\gamma$-ray emission. Redbacks, whose companions are likely non-degenerate and
significantly more massive, generally have more luminous shocks than black
widows which have very low mass companions. This is expected since the more
massive redback companions intercept a greater fraction of the pulsar wind. We
also compare these systems to accreting millisecond pulsars, which may be
progenitors of black widows and in some cases can pass back and forth between
redback and accretion phases.

to examine whether there is any discrepancy between the computed horizon

the task of selecting initial seed users of a topic with minimum size so that

called seed minimization with probabilistic coverage guarantee (SM-PCG). This
problem departs from the previous studies on social influence maximization or
seed minimization because it considers influence coverage with probabilistic
guarantees instead of guarantees on expected influence coverage. We show that
the problem is not submodular, and thus is harder than previously studied
problems based on submodular function optimization. We provide an approximation
algorithm and show that it approximates the optimal solution with both a
multiplicative ratio and an additive error. The multiplicative ratio is tight
while the additive error would be small if influence coverage distributions of
certain seed sets are well concentrated. For one-way bipartite graphs we
analytically prove the concentration condition and obtain an approximation
algorithm with an $O(\log n)$ multiplicative ratio and an $O(\sqrt{n})$
additive error, where $n$ is the total number of nodes in the social graph.
Moreover, we empirically verify the concentration condition in real-world

algorithm comparing to commonly adopted benchmark algorithms.

captures the regions' individual shapes and geometric properties as well as the
""positional geometry"" of the collection. The linking structure extends in a
minimal way the individual ""skeletal structures"" on each of the regions,
allowing us to significantly extend the mathematical methods introduced for
single regions to the configuration.
  We prove for a generic configuration of regions the existence of a special
type of Blum linking structure which builds upon the Blum medial axes of the
individual regions. This requires proving several transversality theorems for
certain associated ""multi-distance"" and ""height-distance"" functions for such
configurations. We show that by relaxing the conditions on the Blum linking
structures we obtain the more general class of skeletal linking structures
which still capture the geometric properties.
  In addition to yielding geometric invariants which capture the shapes and
geometry of individual regions, the linking structures are used to define
invariants which measure positional properties of the configuration such as:
measures of relative closeness of neighboring regions and relative significance
of the individual regions for the configuration. These invariants, which are
computed by formulas involving ""skeletal linking integrals"" on the internal
skeletal structures, are then used to construct a ""tiered linking graph,"" which
identifies subconfigurations and provides a hierarchical ordering of the

and cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) is a crucial step in studying gene
expression, but the computational method attempting to distinguish CRMs from
NCNRs still remains a challenging problem due to the limited knowledge of
specific interactions involved. Methods: The statistical properties of
cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) are explored by estimating the similar-word set
distribution with overrepresentation (Z-score). It is observed that CRMs tend
to have a thin-tail Z-score distribution. A new statistical thin-tail test with
two thinness coefficients is proposed to distinguish CRMs from non-coding
non-regulatory regions (NCNRs). Results: As compared with the existing
fluffy-tail test, the first thinness coefficient is designed to reduce
computational time, making the novel thin-tail test very suitable for long
sequences and large database analysis in the post-genome time and the second
one to improve the separation accuracy between CRMs and NCNRs. These two
thinness coefficients may serve as valuable filtering indexes to predict CRMs
experimentally. Conclusions: The novel thin-tail test provides an efficient and
effective means for distinguishing CRMs from NCNRs based on the specific
statistical properties of CRMs and can guide future experiments aimed at
finding new CRMs in the post-genome time.

Traditionally, Chinese physicians use fingertips to feel the wrist-pulses of

of the Chinese pulse diagnosis is based on the experience of Chinese physicians
for thousands of years. However, there are no quantitative theories to relate
these different wrist-pulse waveforms to the health conditions of patients. In

(TS) models that can be effectively used to represent complex predictive
systems. A new fuzzy clustering method is come up with for the identification
of compact TS-fuzzy models. The best relevant consequent variables of the TS
model are choosen by an orthogonal least squares technique based on the
obtained clusters.For the selection of the relevant antecedent (scheduling)
variables a new method has been developed based on Fisher's interclass
separability basis. This complete approach is demonstrated by means of the
Oxazolines and Oxazoles derivatives as antituberculosis agent for nonlinear
regression benchmark. The results are compared with results obtained by
neuro-fuzzy i.e. ANFIS algorithm and advanced fuzzyy clustering techniques i.e
FMID toolbox .

advantages and disadvantages. But in future it will spread in the whole world.
Many researches are going on for securing the cloud services. Simulation is the
act of imitating or pretending. It is a situation in which a particular set of
condition is created artificially in order to study that could exit in reality.
We need only a simple Operating System with some memory to startup our
Computer. All our resources will be available in the cloud.

spontaneous gauge and Lorentz violations of a chiral SU(2) model. In the
terminology given in the previous paper, the one consists of ""quasi-leptons"",
and the other consists of ""quasi-quarks"" which are massless and have
anisotropic dispersion relations characterized by constant vector potentials. A
low energy approximation shows that quasi fermions of the latter type are
interpretable as collective excitations of the BCS-type vacuum, the Cooper
pairs of which form vector mesons. The same approximation reproduces further a
generation structure similar to that of real quarks.
