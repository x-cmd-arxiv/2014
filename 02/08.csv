field inflation models that invoke transient periods of non-adiabatic
evolution. Such models generate oscillatory features in these spectra spanning
frequencies up to the inverse time scale of the transient feature. To avoid
strong coupling of fluctuations in these theories this scale must be at least
$\sim 10^{-2}/c_s$ of the Hubble time during inflation, where $c_s$ is the
inflaton sound speed. We show that, in such models, the signal-to-noise ratio
of the bispectrum is bounded from above by that of the power spectrum, implying
that searches for features due to non-adiabatic evolution are best focussed
first on the latter.

formation rate in galaxies. The physical origin of this relation, and in
particular its break, i.e. the transition between an inefficient regime at low
gas surface densities and a main regime at higher densities, remains debated.
Here, we study the physical origin of the star formation relations and breaks
in several low-redshift galaxies, from dwarf irregulars to massive spirals. We
use numerical simulations representative of the Milky Way, the Large and the
Small Magellanic Clouds with parsec up to subparsec resolution, and which
reproduce the observed star formation relations and the relative variations of
the star formation thresholds. We analyze the role of interstellar turbulence,
gas cooling, and geometry in drawing these relations, at 100 pc scale. We
suggest in particular that the existence of a break in the Schmidt- Kennicutt
relation could be linked to the transition from subsonic to supersonic
turbulence and is independent of self-shielding effects. This transition being
connected to the gas thermal properties and thus to the metallicity, the break
is shifted toward high surface densities in metal-poor galaxies, as observed in
dwarf galaxies. Our results suggest that together with the collapse of clouds
under self-gravity, turbulence (injected at galactic scale) can induce the
compression of gas and regulate star formation.

vectors exist which generate the same beampattern? The question is relevant to
many fields such as, for example, array processing, radar, wireless
communications, data compression, dimensionality reduction, and biomedical
engineering. The desired property of having the same beampattern for different
columns of a beamspace transformation matrix (beamforming vectors) often plays
a key importance in practical applications. The result is that at most
2^{M-1}-1 beamforming vectors with the same beampattern can be generated from
any given beamforming vector. Here M is the dimension of the beamforming
vector. At the constructive side, the answer to this question allows for
computationally efficient techniques for the beamspace transformation design.
Indeed, one can start with a single beamforming vector, which gives a desired
beampattern, and generate a number of other beamforming vectors, which give
absolutely the same beampattern, in a computationally efficient way. We call
the initial beamforming vector as the mother beamforming vector. One possible
procedure for generating all possible new beamforming vectors with the same
beampattern from the mother beamforming vector is proposed. The application of
the proposed analysis to the transmit beamspace design in multiple-input
multiple-output radar is also given.

cluster radial velocities and metallicities from Calcium II infrared triplet
(CaT) spectra also taken with the VLT. We discovered that the ages of six of
our clusters have been appreciably underestimated by previous studies, which
used comparatively small telescopes, graphically illustrating the need for
large apertures to obtain reliable ages of old and intermediate-age SMC star
clusters. In particular, three of these clusters, L4, L6 and L110, turn out to
be amongst the oldest SMC clusters known, with ages of 7.9 +- 1.1, 8.7 +- 1.2
and 7.6 +- 1.0 Gyr, respectively, helping to fill a possible ""SMC cluster age
gap"" (Glatt et al. 2008). Using the present ages and metallicities from Parisi
et al. (2009), we analyze the age distribution, age gradient and age
metallicity relation (AMR) of a sample of SMC clusters measured homogeneously.
There is a suggestion of bimodality in the age distribution but it does not
show a constant slope for the first 4 Gyr (Piatti 2011), and we find no
evidence for an age gradient. Due to the improved ages of our cluster sample,
we find that our AMR is now better represented in the intermediate/old period
than that we derived in Parisi et al. (2009), where we simply took ages
available in the literature. Additionally, clusters younger than aprox. 4 Gyr
now show better agreement with the bursting model, but we confirm that this
model is not a good representation of the AMR during the intermediate-age/old
period. A more complicated model is needed to explain the SMC chemical
evolution in that period.

tractable ones.
  In this paper, we take advantage of the abstraction power of category theory
and provide a general representation theorem for a wide class of second-order
functionals which are polymorphic over a class of functors. Types polymorphic
over a class of functors are easily representable in languages such as Haskell,
but are difficult to analyse and reason about. The concrete representation
provided by the theorem is easier to analyse, but it might not be as convenient
to implement. Therefore, depending on the task at hand, the change of
representation may prove valuable in one direction or the other.
  We showcase the usefulness of the representation theorem with a range of
examples. Concretely, we show how the representation theorem can be used to
show that traversable functors are finitary containers, how parameterised
coalgebras relate to very well-behaved lenses, and how algebraic effects might
be implemented in a functional language.

RC maps at 22/18 cm from the WSRT SINGS survey, and H-alpha maps to correct for
thermal RC emission. We compare azimuthally averaged radial profiles of the RC
and FUV/MIR-based Sigma_SFR maps and study pixel-by-pixel correlations at fixed
linear scales of 1.2 and 0.7 kpc. The ratio of the integrated SFRs from the RC
emission to that of the FUV/MIR-based SF tracers is R_int = 0.78 +/- 0.38,
consistent with Condon's relation. We find a tight correlation between the
radial profiles of the radio and FUV/MIR-based Sigma_SFR for the entire extent
of the disk. The ratio R of the azimuthally averaged radio to FUV/MIR-based
Sigma_SFR agrees with the integrated ratio with only small quasi-random
fluctuations as function of radius. Pixel-by-pixel plots show a tight
correlation in log-log diagrams of radio to FUV/MIR-based Sigma_SFR, with a
typical standard deviation of a factor of two. Averaged over our sample we find
(Sigma_SFR)_RC ~ (Sigma_SFR)_hyb^{0.63+/-0.25} implying that data points with
high Sigma_SFR are relatively radio dim, whereas the reverse is true for low
Sigma_SFR. We interpret this as a result of spectral ageing of CRe, which is
supported by the radio spectral index: data points dominated by young CRe are
relatively radio dim, those dominated by old CRe are relatively radio bright.
The ratio of radio to FUV/MIR-based integrated SFR is independent of global
galaxy parameters, suggesting that we can use RC emission as a universal SF
tracer for galaxies, if we restrict ourselves to global or azimuthally averaged
measurements. A magnetic field-SFR relation, B ~ SFR_hyb^{0.30+/-0.02}, holding
both globally and locally, can explain our results. (abridged)

and boolean valued models and full details of all proofs are given.
  We focus our presentation using the boolean algebra language and defining an
iteration system as a directed and commutative system of complete and injective
homomorphisms between complete and atomless boolean algebras.
  It is well known that the boolean algebra approach to forcing and iterations
is fully equivalent to the standard one. While there are several monographs
where forcing is introduced by means of boolean valued models, to our knowledge
no detailed account of iterated forcing following a boolean algebraic approach
has yet appeared. We believe that this different approach is fruitful since the
richness of the algebraic language simplifies many calculations and
definitions, among which that of RCS-limits. Some of the advantages of this
approach have been already outlined by Donder and Fuchs in

the notion of limit of an iterated system of forcings in the boolean algebraic
language. The second part contains a proof of the main result of Shelah on
semiproper iterations, i.e. that RCS-limit of semiproper iterations are

investigated. After experimental and modelling studies, a 2D, axisymmetrical
steady-state model called REDUCTOR was developed to simulate a counter-current
moving bed reactor in which hematite pellets are reduced by pure hydrogen. This
model is based on the numerical solution of the local mass, energy and momentum
balances of the gas and solid species by the finite volume method. A single
pellet sub-model was included in the global furnace model to simulate the
successive reactions (hematite->magnetite ->wustite->iron) involved in the
process, using the concept of additive reaction times. The different steps of
mass transfer and possible iron sintering at the grain scale were accounted
for. The kinetic parameters were derived from reduction experiments carried out
in a thermobalance furnace, at different conditions, using small hematite cubes
shaped from industrial pellets. Solid characterizations were also performed to
further understand the microstrutural evolution. First results have shown that
the use of hydrogen accelerates the reduction in comparison to CO reaction,
making it possible to design a hydrogen-operated shaft reactor quite smaller
than current MIDREX and HYL. Globally, the hydrogen steelmaking route based on
this new process is technically and environmentally attractive. CO2 emissions
would be reduced by more than 80%. Its future is linked to the emergence of the

patients receiving proton radiation therapy. The purpose of this work was to
investigate hull-detection algorithms used for preconditioning of the large and
sparse linear system of equations that needs to be solved for pCT image
reconstruction. The hull-detection algorithms investigated here included
silhouette/space carving (SC), modified silhouette/space carving (MSC), and
space modeling (SM). Each was compared to the cone-beam version of filtered
backprojection (FBP) used for hull-detection. Data for testing these algorithms
included simulated data sets of a digital head phantom and an experimental data
set of a pediatric head phantom obtained with a pCT scanner prototype at Loma
Linda University Medical Center. SC was the fastest algorithm, exceeding the
speed of FBP by more than 100 times. FBP was most sensitive to the presence of
noise. Ongoing work will focus on optimizing threshold parameters in order to
define a fast and efficient method for hull-detection in pCT image
reconstruction.

Major advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging are likely to
occur through a quantum field approach to the technology. In this paper, which
is the first part in a series on the topic, the quantum basis of OCT first
order correlations is expressed in terms of full field quantization.
Specifically first order correlations are treated as the linear sum of single
photon interferences along indistinguishable paths. Photons and the
electromagnetic (EM) field are described in terms of quantum harmonic
oscillators. While the author feels the study of quantum second order
correlations will lead to greater paradigm shifts in the field, addressed in
part II, advances from the study of quantum first order correlations are given.
In particular, ranging errors are discussed (with remedies) from vacuum
fluctuations through the detector port, photon counting errors, and position
probability amplitude uncertainty. In addition, the principles of quantum field
theory and first order correlations are needed for studying second order
correlations in part II.

too expensive. Therefore, we consider data from aggregations of energy use,
that is, from sums of individuals' energy use, where each individual falls into
one of C consumer classes. Unfortunately, the exact number of individuals of
each class may be unknown: consumers do not always report the appropriate
class, due to various factors including differential energy rates for different
consumer classes. We develop a methodology to estimate the expected energy use
of each class as a function of time and the true number of consumers in each
class. We also provide some measure of uncertainty of the resulting estimates.
To accomplish this, we assume that the expected consumption is a function of
time that can be well approximated by a linear combination of B-splines.
Individual consumer perturbations from this baseline are modeled as B-splines
with random coefficients. We treat the reported numbers of consumers in each
category as random variables with distribution depending on the true number of
consumers in each class and on the probabilities of a consumer in one class
reporting as another class. We obtain maximum likelihood estimates of all

response from a probability distribution. Although there exist a large number
of similarity measures between distributions, very little is known about their
generalization performance in specific learning tasks. Learning problems
formulated on distributions have an inherent two-stage sampled difficulty: in
practice only samples from sampled distributions are observable, and one has to
build an estimate on similarities computed between sets of points. To the best
of our knowledge, the only existing method with consistency guarantees for
distribution regression requires kernel density estimation as an intermediate
step (which suffers from slow convergence issues in high dimensions), and the
domain of the distributions to be compact Euclidean. In this paper, we provide
theoretical guarantees for a remarkably simple algorithmic alternative to solve
the distribution regression problem: embed the distributions to a reproducing
kernel Hilbert space, and learn a ridge regressor from the embeddings to the
outputs. Our main contribution is to prove the consistency of this technique in
the two-stage sampled setting under mild conditions (on separable, topological
domains endowed with kernels). For a given total number of observations, we
derive convergence rates as an explicit function of the problem difficulty. As
a special case, we answer a 15-year-old open question: we establish the
consistency of the classical set kernel [Haussler, 1999; Gartner et. al, 2002]
in regression, and cover more recent kernels on distributions, including those
due to [Christmann and Steinwart, 2010].

sampler which is traditionally applied to high dimensional analysis when signal
covariances are unknown. Specifically, the proposed method addresses the

covariance matrix from a set of observations. Our method implements a Gibbs
sampling adaptation of the previously presented messenger approach, permitting
to cast the complex multivariate inference problem into a sequence of
uni-variate random processes. In this fashion, the traditional requirement of
inverting high dimensional matrices is completely eliminated from the inference
process, resulting in an efficient algorithm that is trivial to implement.
Using cosmic large scale structure data as a showcase, we demonstrate the
capabilities of our Gibbs sampling approach by performing a joint analysis of
three dimensional density fields and corresponding power-spectra from Gaussian
mock catalogues. These tests clearly demonstrate the ability of the algorithm
to accurately provide measurements of the three dimensional density field and
its power-spectrum and corresponding uncertainty quantification. Moreover,
these tests reveal excellent numerical and statistical efficiency which will
generally render the proposed algorithm a valuable addition to the toolbox of

faint dwarf galaxies to massive clusters containing tens of galaxies the size

the effect of gas and stars, which were historically seen as merely a passive

the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope, Kitt Peak National Observatory,
and Gemini Observatory. Based on our nightly photometric monitoring, we
interpret the strength and timing of fluctuations in the light curve as
interactions between fast-moving ejecta and an inhomogeneous CSM produced by
past eruptions of this massive luminous blue variable (LBV) star. Our time
series of spectroscopy in 2012 reveals that, as the continuum and narrow
H-alpha flux from CSM interactions declines, the broad component of H-alpha
persists with SN-like velocities that are not typically seen in LBVs or SN
Impostor events. At late times we find that SN 2009ip continues to decline
slowly, at <0.01 magnitudes per day, with small fluctuations in slope similar
to Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) or SN impostors, but no further LBV-like
activity. The late time spectrum features broad calcium lines similar to both
late time SNe and SN Impostors. In general, we find that the photometric and
spectroscopic evolution of SN 2009ip is more similar to SNe IIn than either
continued eruptions of an LBV star or SN Impostors. In this context, we discuss
the implications for episodic mass loss during the late stages of massive star
evolution.

disk around LkCa 15, and perform extensive forward modeling to derive the
physical parameters of the disk. We find indications of strongly anisotropic
scattering (Henyey-Greenstein g = 0.67 [-0.11,+0.18]) and a significantly
tapered gap edge ('round wall'), but see no evidence that the inner disk, whose
existence is predicted by the spectral energy distribution, shadows the outer
regions of the disk visible in our images. We marginally confirm the existence
of an offset between the disk center and the star along the line of nodes;
however, the magnitude of this offset (x = 27 [-20,+19] mas) is notably lower
than that found in our earlier H-band images (Thalmann et al. 2010).
Intriguingly, we also find, at high significance, an offset of y = 69 [-25,
+49] mas perpendicular to the line of nodes. If confirmed by future
observations, this would imply a highly elliptical -- or otherwise asymmetric
-- disk gap with an effective eccentricity of e = ~0.3. Such asymmetry would
most likely be the result of dynamical sculpting by one or more unseen planets
in the system. Finally, we find that the bright arc of scattered light we see
in direct imaging observations originates from the near side of the disk, and
appears brighter than the far side because of strong forward scattering.

arise. In particular, for a flux ordering $F_{\nu_e} > F_{\bar\nu_e} >
F_{\nu_x}$, as expected during the SN accretion phase, this instability occurs
in the normal neutrino mass hierarchy. However, during this phase the ordinary
matter density can be larger than the neutrino one, suppressing the
self-induced conversions. At this regard, we investigate the matter suppression
of the MAA effects, performing a linearized stability analysis of the neutrino
equations of motion, in the presence of realistic SN density profiles. We
compare these results with the numerical solution of the SN neutrino non-linear
evolution equations. Assuming axially symmetric distributions of neutrino
momenta we find that the large matter term strongly inhibits the MAA effects.
In particular, the hindrance becomes stronger including realistic
forward-peaked neutrino angular distributions. As a result, in our model for a
$10.8$ $M_{\odot}$ iron-core SNe, MAA instability does not trigger any flavor
conversion during the accretion phase. Instead, for a $8.8$ $M_{\odot}$ O-Ne-Mg
core SN model, with lower matter density profile and less forward-peaked
angular distributions, flavor conversions are possible also at early times.

approach to assessing data quality is also described, and three different
approaches are used to estimate our redshift errors, with robust agreement.
Over the full range of 3.6micron fluxes of our selection, we find typical
redshift uncertainties of sigma_z/(1+z) < 0.015. In comparisons with previously
published spectroscopic redshifts we find scatters of sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.011 for
galaxies at 0.7< z< 0.9, and sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.014 for galaxies at 0.9< z< 1.2.
For galaxies brighter and fainter than i=23 mag, we find sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.008

rates for both red and blue galaxies, largely eliminating color-based
systematics that can seriously bias observed dependencies of galaxy evolution

finite field leads to studying probability measures \rho on the group U of all
infinite uni-uppertriangular matrices over F_q, with the condition that \rho is
invariant under conjugations by arbitrary infinite matrices. Such probability
measures form an infinite-dimensional simplex, and the description of its
extreme points (in other words, ergodic measures \rho) was conjectured by Kerov
in connection with nonnegative specializations of Hall-Littlewood symmetric
functions.
  Vershik and Kerov also conjectured the following Law of Large Numbers.
Consider an n by n diagonal submatrix of the infinite random matrix drawn from
an ergodic measure coming from the Kerov's conjectural classification. The
sizes of Jordan blocks of the submatrix can be interpreted as a (random)
partition of n, or, equivalently, as a (random) Young diagram \lambda(n) with n
boxes. Then, as n goes to infinity, the rows and columns of \lambda(n) have
almost sure limiting frequencies corresponding to parameters of this ergodic
measure.
  Our main result is the proof of this Law of Large Numbers. We achieve it by
analyzing a new randomized Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) insertion algorithm
which samples random Young diagrams \lambda(n) coming from ergodic measures.
The probability weights of these Young diagrams are expressed in terms of
Hall-Littlewood symmetric functions. Our insertion algorithm is a modified and
extended version of a recent construction by Borodin and the second author
(arXiv:1305.5501). On the other hand, our randomized RSK insertion generalizes
a version of the RSK insertion introduced by Vershik and Kerov (1986) in
connection with asymptotic representation theory of symmetric groups (which is
governed by nonnegative specializations of Schur symmetric functions).

analysis we focused on aNobii, a social platform with a world-wide user base of
book readers, who like to post their readings, give ratings, review books and
discuss them with friends and fellow readers. aNobii presents a heterogeneous
structure: i) part social network, with user-to-user interactions, ii) part
interest network, with the management of book collections, and iii) part
folksonomy, with books that are tagged by the users. We analyzed a complete and
anonymized snapshot of aNobii and we focused on three specific activities a
user can perform, namely her tagging behavior, her tendency to join groups and
her aptitude to compile a wishlist reporting the books she is planning to read.
In this way each user is associated with a tag-based, a group-based and a
wishlist-based profile. Experimental analysis carried out by means of
Information Theory tools like entropy and mutual information suggests that
tag-based and group-based profiles are in general more informative than
wishlist-based ones. Furthermore, we discover that the degree of correlation
between the three profiles associated with the same user tend to be small.
Hence, user profiling cannot be reduced to considering just any one type of
user activity (although important) but it is crucial to incorporate multiple
dimensions to effectively describe users preferences and behavior.

We first obtain results regarding the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of the power

impact of the distance and resistance distance on the flow increase following a

would be a windfall for multiple areas of biological research including
medicine, molecular biology, and evolution. Complete knowledge of function
would aid in the prioritization of loci when searching for the genetic bases of
disease or adaptive phenotypes. Because mutations that disrupt function are
disfavored by natural selection, purifying selection leaves a detectable
signature within functional elements; accordingly this signal has been
exploited through the use of genomic comparisons of distantly related species.
However, the functional complement of the genome changes extensively across
time and between lineages, therefore, evidence of the current action of
purifying selection is essential. Because the removal of deleterious mutations
by natural selection also reduces within-species genetic diversity within
functional loci, dense population genetic data have the potential to reveal
genomic elements that are currently functional. Here we assess the potential of
this approach using 16,411 human mitochondrial genomes. We show that the high
density of polymorphism in this dataset precisely delineates regions
experiencing purifying selection. Further, we show that the number of
segregating alleles at a site is strongly correlated with its divergence across
species after accounting for known mutational biases in human mtDNA. These two
measures track one another at a remarkably fine scale across many loci--a
correlation that is purely the result of natural selection. Our results
demonstrate that genetic variation has the potential to reveal exactly which
nucleotides in the genome are currently performing important functions and
likely to have deleterious fitness effects when mutated. As more complete
genomes are sequenced, similar power to reveal purifying selection may be
achievable in the human nuclear genome.

incorporating side information provided via human expertise in order to
increase the semantic meaningfulness of the resulting clusters. However, most
current methods are \emph{passive} in the sense that the side information is
provided beforehand and selected randomly. This may require a large number of
constraints, some of which could be redundant, unnecessary, or even detrimental
to the clustering results. Thus in order to scale such semi-supervised
algorithms to larger problems it is desirable to pursue an \emph{active}
clustering method---i.e. an algorithm that maximizes the effectiveness of the
available human labor by only requesting human input where it will have the
greatest impact. Here, we propose a novel online framework for active
semi-supervised spectral clustering that selects pairwise constraints as
clustering proceeds, based on the principle of uncertainty reduction. Using a
first-order Taylor expansion, we decompose the expected uncertainty reduction
problem into a gradient and a step-scale, computed via an application of matrix
perturbation theory and cluster-assignment entropy, respectively. The resulting
model is used to estimate the uncertainty reduction potential of each sample in
the dataset. We then present the human user with pairwise queries with respect
to only the best candidate sample. We evaluate our method using three different

complement of proteins, termed proteomics. Currently, the most effective method
to measure the proteome is with shotgun, or bottom-up, proteomics, in which the
proteome is digested into peptides that are identified followed by protein
inference. Despite continuous improvements to all steps of the shotgun
proteomics workflow, observed proteome coverage is often low; some proteins are
identified by a single peptide sequence. Complete proteome sequence coverage
would allow comprehensive characterization of RNA splicing variants and all
post translational modifications, which would drastically improve the accuracy
of biological models. There are many reasons for the sequence coverage deficit,
but ultimately peptide length determines sequence observability. Peptides that
are too short are lost because they match many protein sequences and their true
origin is ambiguous. The maximum observable peptide length is determined by
several analytical challenges. This paper explores computationally how peptide
lengths produced from several common proteome digestion methods limit
observable proteome coverage. Iterative proteome cleavage strategies are also
explored. These simulations reveal that maximized proteome coverage can be
achieved by use of an iterative digestion protocol involving multiple proteases
and chemical cleavages that theoretically allow 91.1% proteome coverage.

small-scale forcing. In a flat space, such energy growth is due to an inverse
cascade, which builds a constant part of the velocity autocorrelation function
proportional to time and expanding in scales, while the moments of the velocity
difference saturate during a time depending on the distance. For the curved
space, we analyze the long-time long-distance scaling limit, that lives in a
degenerate conical geometry, and find that the energy-containing mode linearly
growing with time is not constant in space. The shape of the velocity
correlation function indicates that the energy builds up in vortical rings of
arbitrary diameter but of width comparable to the curvature radius of the
hyperbolic plane. The energy current across scales does not increase linearly
with the scale, as in a flat space, but reaches a maximum around the curvature
radius. That means that the energy flux through scales decreases at larger
scales so that the energy is transferred in a non-cascade way, that is the
inverse cascade spills over to all larger scales where the energy pumped into
the system is cumulated in the rings. The time-saturated part of the spectral

cone beam CT reconstruction. Subsequently, we provide an efficient solution to
the formulated CS problem based on a Fast Composite Splitting Algorithm-Latent

pseudo polar Fourier transform as the measurement matrix in order to decrease

patterns, are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom. On the other hand, movement and
space use are also greatly influenced by the interactions between animals and
their environment. Despite both types of interaction fundamentally influencing
animal behaviour, there has hitherto been no unifying framework for the models
proposed in both areas. Here, we construct a general method for inferring
population-level spatial patterns from underlying individual movement and
interaction processes, a key ingredient in building a statistical mechanics for
ecological systems. We show that resource selection functions, as well as
several examples of collective motion models, arise as special cases of our
framework, thus bringing together resource selection analysis and collective
animal behaviour into a single theory. In particular, we focus on combining the
various mechanistic models of territorial interactions in the literature with
step selection functions, by incorporate interactions into the step selection
framework and demonstrating how to derive territorial patterns from the
resulting models. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model by application to a
population of insectivore birds in the Amazon rainforest.

natural and social sciences. Predicting their behavior often requires models
that mimic these systems with sufficient accuracy, while accounting for their
inherent stochasticity. Though tools exist to determine which of a set of
candidate models is best relative to the others, there is currently no generic
goodness-of-fit framework for testing how close the best model is to the real
complex stochastic system.
  2. We propose such a framework, using a novel application of the Earth
mover's distance, also known as the Wasserstein metric. It is applicable to any
stochastic process where the probability of the model's state at time $t$ is a
function of the state at previous times. It generalizes the concept of a
residual, often used to analyze 1D summary statistics, to situations where the
complexity of the underlying model's probability distribution makes standard
residual analysis too imprecise for practical use.
  3. We give a scheme for testing the hypothesis that a model is an accurate
description of a data set. We demonstrate the tractability and usefulness of
our approach by application to animal movement models in complex, heterogeneous
environments. We detail methods for visualizing results and extracting a
variety of information on a given model's quality, such as whether there is any
inherent bias in the model, or in which situations it is most accurate. We
demonstrate our techniques by application to data on multi-species flocks of
insectivore birds in the Amazon rainforest.
  4. This work provides a usable toolkit to assess the quality of generic
movement models of complex systems, in an absolute rather than a relative

unit square, cube, or hypercube. The function from the unit line segment is
continuous. The inverse function, while well-defined, is not continuous.
Space-filling curves, the finite approximations to space-filling functions,
have found application in global optimization, database indexing, and dimension
reduction among others. For these applications the desired transforms are
mapping a scalar to multidimensional coordinates and mapping multidimensional
coordinates to a scalar.
  Presented are recurrences which produce space-filling functions and curves of
any rank $d\ge2$ based on serpentine Hamiltonian paths on $({\bf Z}\bmod s)^d$
where $s\ge2$. The recurrences for inverse space-filling functions are also
presented. Both Peano and Hilbert curves and functions and their
generalizations to higher dimensions are produced by these recurrences. The
computations of these space-filling functions and their inverse functions are
absolutely convergent geometric series.
  The space-filling functions are constructed as limits of integer recurrences
and equivalently as non-terminating real recurrences. Scaling relations are
given which enable the space-filling functions and curves and their inverses to
extend beyond the unit area or volume and even to all of $d$-space.
  This unification of pandimensional space-filling curves facilitates
quantitative comparison of curves generated from different Hamiltonian paths.
The isotropy and performance in dimension reduction of a variety of
space-filling curves are analyzed.
  For dimension reduction it is found that Hilbert curves perform somewhat
better than Peano curves and their isotropic variants.

squared planar region and communicate with each other without the help of a
wired infrastructure. For this network, we examine the 3-phase hierarchical
cooperation (HC) scheme and the 2-phase improved HC scheme based on the concept
of {\em network multiple access}. Exploiting recent results on the optimality
of treating interference as noise in Gaussian interference channels, we
optimize the achievable average per-link rate and not just its scaling law. In
addition, we provide further improvements on both the previously proposed
hierarchical cooperation schemes by a more efficient use of TDMA and spatial
reuse. Thanks to our explicit achievable rate expressions, we can compare HC
scheme with multihop routing (MR), where the latter can be regarded as the
current practice of D2D wireless networks. Our results show that the improved
and optimized HC schemes yield very significant rate gains over MR in realistic
conditions of channel propagation exponents, signal to noise ratio, and number
of users. This sheds light on the long-standing question about the real
advantage of HC scheme over MR beyond the well-known scaling laws analysis. In
contrast, we also show that our rate optimization is non-trivial, since when HC
is applied with off-the-shelf choice of the system parameters, no significant
rate gain with respect to MR is achieved. We also show that for large pathloss
exponent the sum rate is a nearly linear function of the number of users $n$ in
the range of networks of practical size. This also sheds light on a
long-standing dispute on the effective achievability of linear sum rate scaling
with HC. Finally, we notice that the achievable sum rate for large $\alpha$ is
much larger than for small $\alpha$. This suggests that HC scheme may be a very
effective approach for networks operating at mm-waves.

Both the quantum particle and atoms are restricted to the sites of a

context of the canonical ensemble in which the quantum particle is represented
by a closed, variable-step random walk on the lattice. Monte Carlo methods are
employed to determine the system's properties. For the case of a free particle,
analytical expressions for the energy, its fluctuations, and the qp-qp
correlation function are derived and compared with the Monte Carlo simulations.
To test the usefulness of the path integral formalism, the Metropolis algorithm
is employed to determine the equilibrium properties of the qp for a periodic
interaction potential, forcing the qp to occupy extended states. We consider a
striped potential in one dimension, where every other lattice site is occupied
by an atom with potential $\epsilon$, and every other lattice site is empty.
This potential serves as a stress test for the path integral formalism because
of its rapid site-to-site variation. An analytical solution was determined in
this case by utilizing Bloch's theorem due to the periodicity of the potential.
Comparisons of the potential energy, the total energy, the energy fluctuations

six points we give the explicit form of numerators in terms of amplitudes,

molecules have been reported as identified in the photospheric spectrum of the
Sun. This could be the first detection of a mercapto radical in the solar

observations additionally tested the utilized theoretical band oscillator
strength. Sunspots being cooler than the photosphere are the hosts to a large
number of molecular species. However, owing to photospheric radiation scattered
into the observed umbra, the discoverers could not detect the lines of SH in
the sunspot spectrum where they are expected to show larger than the
photospheric equivalent widths (EWs in short). Detection of weak lines in
photospheric spectrum coupled with a no-detection of the relatively strong same
lines in the sunspot spectrum might cause doubts on the detection itself. The
above problem is investigated here in detail with a choice on photospheric and
sunspot models and micro-turbulence values. The new results indicate that the
predicted sunspot lines are about half intense than reported before and the
lines remain of detectable strengths. Further, a need for a laboratory
determination of oscillator strengths is felt.

including the original holographic dark energy (HDE) model, the new holographic
dark energy model, the new agegraphic dark energy (NADE) model, and the Ricci
dark energy model. In the low-redshift region the holographic dark energy
models are degenerate with each other and with the $\Lambda$CDM model in the
$H(z)$ and $q(z)$ evolutions. In particular, the HDE model is highly degenerate
with the $\Lambda$CDM model, and in the HDE model the cases with different
parameter values are also in strong degeneracy. Since the observational data
are mainly within the low-redshift region, it is very important to break this
low-redshift degeneracy in the $H(z)$ and $q(z)$ diagnostics by using some
quantities with higher order derivatives of the scale factor. It is shown that
the statefinder diagnostic $r(z)$ is very useful in breaking the low-redshift
degeneracies. By employing the statefinder diagnostic the holographic dark
energy models can be differentiated efficiently in the low-redshift region. The
degeneracy between the holographic dark energy models and the $\Lambda$CDM
model can also be broken by this method. Especially for the HDE model, all the
previous strong degeneracies appearing in the $H(z)$ and $q(z)$ diagnostics are
broken effectively. But for the NADE model, the degeneracy between the cases
with different parameter values cannot be broken, even though the statefinder
diagnostic is used. A direct comparison of the holographic dark energy models
in the $r$--$s$ plane is also made, in which the separations between the models

$\lambda$ and an additional topological term ($\beta$) in the Hamiltonian of
MoS$_2$ result in an enhancement of the charge conductance of the CT and CAR
processes and make them to be present for long lengths of the superconducting
region. Besides, we find that the thermal conductance of the structure with a
small length of the highly doped superconducting region exhibits linear
dependence on the temperature at low temperatures whereas it enhances
exponentially at higher temperatures. In particular, we demonstrate that the
thermal conductance versus the strength of the exchange field ($h$) in F region
displays a maximum value at $h<\lambda$, which moves towards larger exchange
fields by increasing the temperature.

arbitrary dimensions and in a space provided with a Weyl connection, which is
torsionless but not metric-compatible, the non-metricity tensor being
determined by a vector field. The considered action consists of the usual
Einstein-Hilbert action plus all the terms quadratic in the curvature that
reduce to the usual Gauss-Bonnet term for vanishing Weyl connection, i.e., when
only the Levi-Civita part of the connection is present. We expand the action in
terms of Riemannian quantities and obtain vector-tensor theories. We find that
all the free parameters only appear in the kinetic term of the vector field so
that two branches are possible: one with a propagating vector field and another
one where the vector field does not propagate. We focus on the propagating
case. We find that in 4 dimensions, the theory is equivalent to Einstein's
gravity plus a Proca field. This field is naturally decoupled from matter so
that it represents a natural candidate for dark matter. Also in d=4, we discuss
a non-trivial cubic term in the curvature that can be constructed without
spoiling the second order nature of the field equations because it leads to the
vector-tensor Horndeski interaction. In arbitrary dimensions, the theory
becomes more involved. We show that, even though the vector field presents
kinetic interactions which do not have U(1) symmetry, there are no additional
propagating degrees of freedom with respect to the usual massive case.
Interestingly, we show that this relies on the fact that the corresponding
Stueckelberg field belongs to a specific class within the general Horndeski
theories. Finally, since Weyl geometries are the natural ground to build scale
invariant theories, we apply the usual Weyl-gauging in order to make the
Horndeski action locally scale invariant and discuss on new terms that can be
added.

features seen in the spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and quasi-stellar
objects (QSOs). These outflows also represent a natural form of feedback
between the central supermassive black hole and its host galaxy. The mechanism
for driving this mass loss remains unknown, although radiation pressure
mediated by spectral lines is a leading candidate. Here, we calculate the
ionization state of, and emergent spectra for, the hydrodynamic simulation of a
line-driven disk wind previously presented by Proga & Kallman (2004). To
achieve this, we carry out a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation of the
radiative transfer through, and energy exchange within, the predicted outflow.
We find that the wind is much more ionized than originally estimated. This is
in part because it is much more difficult to shield any wind regions
effectively when the outflow itself is allowed to reprocess and redirect
ionizing photons. As a result, the calculated spectrum that would be observed
from this particular outflow solution would not contain the ultraviolet
spectral lines that are observed in many AGN/QSOs. Furthermore, the wind is so
highly ionized that line-driving would not actually be efficient. This does not
necessarily mean that line-driven winds are not viable. However, our work does
illustrate that in order to arrive at a self-consistent model of line-driven
disk winds in AGN/QSO, it will be critical to include a more detailed treatment
of radiative transfer and ionization in the next generation of hydrodynamic
simulations.

one expects confinement to favour the binding of particles. However,
attractively interacting bosons apparently defy this expectation: while three
identical bosons in three dimensions can support an infinite tower of Efimov
trimers, only two universal trimers exist in the two dimensional case. We
reveal how these two limits are connected by investigating the problem of three
identical bosons confined by a harmonic potential along one direction. We show
that the confinement breaks the discrete Efimov scaling symmetry and destroys
the weakest bound trimers. However, the deepest bound Efimov trimer persists
under strong confinement and hybridizes with the quasi-two-dimensional trimers,
yielding a superposition of trimer configurations that effectively involves
tunnelling through a short-range repulsive barrier. Our results suggest a way

interactions of network elements. We model the network collapse, taking into
account the steric interactions. The model shows how the system robustly drives
itself towards the critical point of the random percolation model with absorbed
enclaves, in agreement with the experiment.

A 88, 033835 (2013)","10.1103/PhysRevA.88.033835",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Taking the non-Markovian effect into account, we study how to store a single
photon of arbitrary temporal shape in a single atom coupled to an optical
cavity. Our model applies to Raman transitions in three-level atoms with one
branch of the transition controlled by a driving pulse, and the other coupled
to the cavity. For any couplings of input field to the optical cavity and
detunings of the atom from the driving pulse and cavity, we extend the
input-output relation from Markovian dynamics to non-Markovian one. For most
possible photon shapes, we derive an analytic expression for the driving pulse
in order to completely map the input photon into the atom. We find that, the
amplitude of the driving pulse depends only on the detuning of the atom from
the frequency of the cavity, i.e., the detuning of the atom to the driving
pulse has no effect on the strength of the driving pulse.

  Coronal Flux Ropes and the Initiation of CMEs",,,"10.1088/0004-637X/787/1/46",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present results from 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the
emergence of a twisted convection zone flux tube into a pre-existing coronal
dipole field. As in previous simulations, following the partial emergence of
the sub-surface flux into the corona, a combination of vortical motions and
internal magnetic reconnection forms a coronal flux rope. Then, in the
simulations presented here, external reconnection between the emerging field
and the pre-existing dipole coronal field allows further expansion of the
coronal flux rope into the corona. After sufficient expansion, internal
reconnection occurs beneath the coronal flux rope axis, and the flux rope
erupts up to the top boundary of the simulation domain ($\sim$ 36 Mm above the
surface). We find that the presence of a pre-existing field, orientated in a
direction to facilitate reconnection with the emerging field, is vital to the
fast rise of the coronal flux rope. The simulations shown in this paper are
able to self-consistently create many of the surface and coronal signatures
used by coronal mass ejection (CME) models. These signatures include: surface
shearing and rotational motions; quadrupolar geometry above the surface;
central sheared arcades reconnecting with oppositely orientated overlying
dipole fields; the formation of coronal flux ropes underlying potential coronal
field; and internal reconnection which resembles the classical flare
reconnection scenario. This suggests that proposed mechanisms for the
initiation of a CME, such as ""magnetic breakout"", are operating during the
emergence of new active regions.

is proved that invisibility is possible. This paper describes the creation of
invisibility with the help of technologies like Optical camouflage; Image based
rendering and Retro reflective projection. The object that needs to be made
transparent or invisible is painted or covered with retro reflective material.
Then a projector projects the background image on it making the masking object
virtually transparent. Capturing the background image requires a video camera,
which sits behind the person wearing the cloak. The video from the camera must
be in a digital format so it can be sent to a computer for image processing
using image based rendering technical. There are some useful applications for
this simple but astonishing technology.
