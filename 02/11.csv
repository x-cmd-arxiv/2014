fourth-order Schr\""odinger equation with isotropic and anisotropic mixed
dispersion. This model is given by the equation $i\partial _{t}u+\epsilon
\Delta u+\delta A u+\lambda|u|^\alpha u=0,$ $x\in \mathbb{R}^{n},$ $t\in
\mathbb{R},$ where $A$ represents either the operator $\Delta^2$ (isotropic
dispersion) or $\sum_{i=1}^d\partial_{x_ix_ix_ix_i},\ 1\leq d<n$ (anisotropic
dispersion), and $\alpha, \epsilon, \lambda$ are given real parameters. We
obtain local and global well-posedness results in spaces of initial data with
low regularity, such as weak-$L^p$ spaces. Our analysis also includes the
biharmonic and anisotropic biharmonic equation $(\epsilon=0)$ for which, the
existence of self-similar solutions is obtained as consequence of his scaling
invariance. In a second part, we investigate the vanishing second order
dispersion limit in the framework of weak-$L^p$ spaces. We also analyze the
convergence of the solutions for the nonlinear fourth-order Schr\""odinger
equation $i\partial _{t}u+\epsilon \Delta u+\delta \Delta^2 u+\lambda|u|^\alpha

control theory and modern, network-based epidemic models. In particular, we
apply nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to a pairwise ODE model which
we use to model a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) epidemic on
non-trivial contact structures. While classic control of epidemics concentrates
on aspects such as vaccination, quarantine and fast diagnosis, our novel setup
allows us to deliver control by altering the contact network within the
population. Moreover, the ideal outcome of control is to eradicate the disease
while keeping the network well connected. The paper gives a thorough and
detailed numerical investigation of the impact and interaction of system and
control parameters on the controllability of the system. The analysis reveals,
that for certain set parameters it is possible to identify critical control
bounds above which the system is controllable. We foresee, that our approach
can be extended to even more realistic or simulation-based models with the aim
to apply these to real-world situations.

is stimulated by predicted and received pain, discomfort, aversive outcome,
loss. Its chronic stimulation makes us feel worse/low and gradually stops us
choosing and moving for suboptimal, hurtful or punished choices, by direct and
indirect (via RMTg) inhibition of DRN and VTA/SNc. Response selectivity of LHb
neurons suggests their cortical input from affective and cognitive evaluative
regions that make expectations about bad or suboptimal outcomes. Based on these
facts I predicted direct corticohabenular projections from the dACC, pgACC and
AI, as part of the adversity processing circuit that learns to avoid bad
outcomes by suppressing dopamine and serotonin signal. Using DTI I found dACC,
pgACC, AI, adjacent caudolateral and lateral OFC projections to LHb. I
predicted no corticohabenular projections from the reward processing regions:
medial OFC and vACC because both respond most strongly to good, high value
stimuli and outcomes, inducing serotonin and dopamine release respectively.
This lack of LHb projections was confirmed for vACC and likely for mOFC. The
surprising findings were the corticohabenular projections from the cognitive
prefrontal cortex regions, known for flexible reasoning, planning and combining
whatever information are relevant for reaching current goals. I propose that
prefrontohabenular projections provide a teaching signal for value-based choice
behaviour, to learn to deselect, avoid or inhibit the potentially harmful, low
valued or wrong choices, goals, strategies, predictions, models and ways of
doing things, to prevent bad or suboptimal consequences.

sink node and any other node in the deployed area. But all the proposed virtual
backbone trees are not fully energy efficient and EVBTs have few flaws
associated with them. In this paper two such virtual backbones are proposed.
The motive behind the first algorithm, Most Minimal Energy Virtual Backbone
Tree (MMEVBT), is to minimise the energy consumption when packets are
transmitted between sink and a target sensor node. The energy consumption is
most minimal and optimal and it is shown why it always has minimal energy
consumption during any transfer of packet between every node with the sink
node. For every node, route path with most minimal energy consumption is
identified and a new tree node is elected only when a better minimal energy
consumption route is identified for a node to communicate with the sink and
vice versa. By moving sink periodically it is ensured the battery of the nodes
near sink is not completely drained out. Another backbone construction
algorithm is proposed which maximises the network lifetime by increasing the
lifetime of all tree nodes. Simulations are done in NS2 to practically test the
algorithms and the results are discussed in detail.

the form of RAIRS and temperature-programmed desorption spectra of O2 and O3
produced via two pathways: O + O and O2 + O, investigated in a submonolayer
regime and in the range of temperature between 6.5 and 30 K. All the
experiments show that ozone is formed efficiently on silicate at any surface
temperature between 6.5 and 30 K. The derived upper limit for the activation
barriers of O + O and O2 + O reactions is 150 K/kb. Ozone formation at low
temperatures indicates that fast diffusion of O atoms is at play even at 6.5 K.
Through a series of rate equations included in our model, we also address the
reaction mechanisms and show that neither the Eley Rideal nor the Hot atom
mechanisms alone can explain the experimental values. The rate of diffusion of
O atoms, based on modeling results, is much higher than the one generally
expected, and the diffusive process proceeds via the Langmuir-Hinshelwood
mechanism enhanced by tunnelling. In fact, quantum effects turn out to be a key
factor that cannot be neglected in our simulations. Astrophysically, efficient
O3 formation on interstellar dust grains would imply the presence of huge
reservoirs of oxygen atoms. Since O3 is a reservoir of elementary oxygen, and
also of OH via its hydrogenation, it could explain the observed concomitance of

the adiabatic approximation of time-dependent density functional theory in
modelling time-resolved charge transfer. We show that the model shares
essential features of a ground state long-range molecule in real-space, and by
applying a resonant field we show that the model also reproduces essential
traits of the CT dynamics. The simplicity of the model allows us to propagate
with an ""adiabatically-exact"" approximation, i.e. one that uses the exact
ground-state exchange-correlation functional, and compare with the exact
propagation. This allows us to study the impact of the time-dependent
charge-transfer step feature in the exact correlation potential of real
molecules on the resulting dynamics. Tuning the parameters of the dimer allows
a study both of charge-transfer between open-shell fragments and between
closed-shell fragments. We find that the adiabatically-exact functional is
unable to properly transfer charge, even in situations where the
adiabatically-exact resonance frequency is remarkably close to the exact
resonance, and we analyze why.

widely studied and it is the technology that is attracting a large variety of
applications. Routing in MANETs is considered a challenging task due to the
unpredictable changes in the network topology, resulting from the random and
frequent movement of the nodes and due to the absence of any centralized
control [1][2]. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of reactive routing
protocols, Ad hoc On demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing
(DSR) and proactive routing protocol Destination Sequenced Distance Vector
(DSDV). The major goal of this study is to analyze the performance of well
known MANETs routing protocol in high mobility case under low, medium and high
density scenario. Unlike military applications, most of the other applications
of MANETs require moderate to high mobility. Hence it becomes important to
study the impact of high mobility on the performance of these routing
protocols. The performance is analyzed with respect to Average End-to-End

robust estimate of the isotropic radio background, with limited scatter among
different Galactic models. The level of the isotropic background lies
significantly above the contribution obtained by integrating the number counts
of observed extragalactic sources. Since the isotropic component dominates at
high latitudes, thus making the profile of the total emission flat, a Galactic
origin for such excess appears unlikely. We conclude that, unless a systematic
offset is present in the maps, and provided that our current understanding of
the Galactic synchrotron emission is reasonable, extragalactic sources well
below the current experimental threshold seem to account for the majority of
the brightness of the extragalactic radio sky.

PAC learning and differential privacy. Informally, a private learner is applied
to a collection of labeled individual information and outputs a hypothesis
while preserving the privacy of each individual. Kasiviswanathan et al. gave a
generic construction of private learners for (finite) concept classes, with
sample complexity logarithmic in the size of the concept class. This sample
complexity is higher than what is needed for non-private learners, hence
leaving open the possibility that the sample complexity of private learning may
be sometimes significantly higher than that of non-private learning.
  We give a combinatorial characterization of the sample size sufficient and
necessary to privately learn a class of concepts. This characterization is
analogous to the well known characterization of the sample complexity of
non-private learning in terms of the VC dimension of the concept class. We
introduce the notion of probabilistic representation of a concept class, and
our new complexity measure RepDim corresponds to the size of the smallest
probabilistic representation of the concept class.
  We show that any private learning algorithm for a concept class C with sample
complexity m implies RepDim(C)=O(m), and that there exists a private learning
algorithm with sample complexity m=O(RepDim(C)). We further demonstrate that a
similar characterization holds for the database size needed for privately
computing a large class of optimization problems and also for the well studied
problem of private data release.

  Hellerstein, Ion Stoica","Coordination Avoidance in Database Systems (Extended Version)","Extended version of paper appearing in PVLDB Vol. 8, No. 3",,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Minimizing coordination, or blocking communication between concurrently
executing operations, is key to maximizing scalability, availability, and high
performance in database systems. However, uninhibited coordination-free
execution can compromise application correctness, or consistency. When is
coordination necessary for correctness? The classic use of serializable
transactions is sufficient to maintain correctness but is not necessary for all
applications, sacrificing potential scalability. In this paper, we develop a
formal framework, invariant confluence, that determines whether an application
requires coordination for correct execution. By operating on application-level
invariants over database states (e.g., integrity constraints), invariant
confluence analysis provides a necessary and sufficient condition for safe,
coordination-free execution. When programmers specify their application
invariants, this analysis allows databases to coordinate only when anomalies
that might violate invariants are possible. We analyze the invariant confluence
of common invariants and operations from real-world database systems (i.e.,
integrity constraints) and applications and show that many are invariant
confluent and therefore achievable without coordination. We apply these results
to a proof-of-concept coordination-avoiding database prototype and demonstrate
sizable performance gains compared to serializable execution, notably a 25-fold
improvement over prior TPC-C New-Order performance on a 200 server cluster.

produces an unusual thermally-emitting pulsar wind nebula observed in X-rays.
Deep optical observations were obtained to search for the pulsar optical
counterpart and its nebula using the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). The direct
imaging mode in the Sloan $g'$ band was used. Archival X-ray data were
reanalysed and compared with the optical data. No pulsar optical counterpart
was detected down to $g'\geq~28_{\cdotp}^{\text{m}}1$. No pulsar nebula was
either identified in the optical. We confirm early results that the X-ray
spectrum of the pulsar consists of a nonthermal power-law component of the
pulsar magnetospheric origin dominating at high energies and a soft thermal
component from the neutron star surface. Using magnetised partially ionised
hydrogen atmosphere models in X-ray spectral fits we found that the thermal
component can come from entire surface of the cooling neutron star with a
temperature of 36$^{+9}_{-6}$ eV, making it one of the coldest among cooling
neutron stars known. The surface temperature agrees with the standard neutron
star cooling scenario. The optical upper limit does not put any additional
constraints on the thermal component, however it implies a strong spectral
break for the nonthermal component between the optical and X-rays as is
observed in other middle-aged pulsars. The thermal emission from the entire
surface of the neutron star likely dominates over the nonthermal emission in
the UV range. Observations of the PSR J0357+3205 in this range are promising to
put more stringent constraints on its thermal properties.

discuss the advantage of this method with respect to the previously explored
ones: the electron low penetration power allows for simple and versatile probes

prototype and studied its performances on phantoms. By means of a detailed

in a realistic case of meningioma, pathology which is going to be our first

acoustic waves into the monopole of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB),
resulting in spectral distortions. These can be used to probe the primordial
scalar power spectrum on smaller scales than it is possible with CMB
anisotropies. An enhancement of power on these scales is nevertheless required
for the resulting distortions to be detectable by future experiments like
PIXIE. In this paper, we examine all 49 single-field inflation models listed by
Martin et al. in the Encyclopaedia Inflationaris [1] and find that only one of
these may lead to a detectable level of distortions in a tuned region of its
parameter space, namely the original hybrid model. Three effective multi-field
scenarios are also studied: with softly and suddenly turning trajectories, and
with a mild waterfall trajectory. Softly turning trajectories do not induce
distortions at any detectable level, whereas a sudden turn in the field space
or a mild waterfall trajectory predicts a peak (plus damped oscillations in the
sudden turn case) in the scalar power spectrum, which can lead to an observable
amount of CMB distortions. Finally, another scenario leading to potentially
detectable distortions involves a curvaton whose blue spectrum is subdominant
on CMB angular scales and overtakes the inflaton spectrum on smaller scales. In
this case however, we show that the bounds from ultra compact minihaloes are
not satisfied. Expectations for an ultimate PRISM-class experiment
characterized by an improvement in sensitivity by a factor of ten are discussed

optical/near-IR photometry to determine the rest-frame U-V vs V-J colours of
X-ray AGN hosts at mean redshifts 0.40 and 0.85. This combination of colours
(UVJ) provides an efficient means of separating quiescent from star-forming,
including dust reddened, galaxies. Morphological information emphasises
differences between AGN split by their UVJ colours. AGN in quiescent galaxies
are dominated by spheroids, while star-forming hosts are split between bulges
and disks. The UVJ diagram of AGN hosts is then used to set limits on the
accretion density associated with evolved and star-forming systems. Most of the
black hole growth since z~1 is associated with star-forming hosts.
Nevertheless, ~15-20% of the X-ray luminosity density since z~1, is taking
place in the quiescent region of the UVJ diagram. For the z~0.40 subsample,
there is tentative evidence (2sigma significance), that AGN split by their UVJ
colours differ in Eddington ratio. AGN in star-forming hosts dominate at high
Eddington ratios, while AGN in quiescent hosts become increasingly important as
a fraction of the total population toward low Eddington ratios. At higher
redshift, z~0.8, such differences are significant at the 2sigma level only at
Eddington ratios >1e-3. These findings are consistent with scenarios in which
diverse accretion modes are responsible for the build-up of SMBHs at the
centres of galaxies. We compare our results with the GALFORM semi-analytic
model, which postulates two black hole fuelling modes, the first linked to
star-formation and the second occuring in passive galaxies. GALFORM predicts a
larger fraction of black hole growth in quiescent galaxies at z<1, compared to
the data. Relaxing the strong assumption of the model that passive AGN hosts
have zero star-formation rate could reconcile this disagreement.

as a prototype for the more general class of high-luminosity high-redshift
QSOs. We run the radiative transfer code TRADING to follow the transfer of
radiation from the central source and from stellar sources through the dusty
environment of the host galaxy. The model is based on the output of the
semi-analytical merger tree code, GAMETE/QSOdust, which enables to predict the
evolution of the host galaxy and of its nuclear black hole, following the star
formation history and chemical evolution -- including dust -- in all the
progenitor galaxies of SDSS J1148+5251. We find that the radiation emitted by
the central source can also provide an important source of heating for the dust
distributed in the host galaxy, powering at least 30% and up to 70% of the
observed far infrared emission at rest-frame wavelengths [20 - 1000]micron. The
remaining fraction is contributed by stellar sources and can only be achieved
if the host galaxy is able to sustain a star formation rate of ~ 900 Msun/yr at
z=6.4. This points to a co-evolution scenario where, during their hierarchical
assembly, the first SMBHs and their host galaxies first grow at the same pace
until the black hole reaches a mass of ~ 2 10^8 Msun and starts growing faster
than its host, reaching the bright quasar phase when the black hole and stellar
mass fall within the scatter of the scaling relation observed in local
galaxies. This same evolutionary scenario has been recently shown to explain
the properties of a larger sample of 5 < z <6.4 QSOs, and imply that current
dynamical mass measurements may have missed an important fraction of the host
galaxy stellar mass. We conclude that the FIR luminosity of high-z quasars is a
sensitive tracer of the rapidly changing physical conditions in the host
galaxy.

for the Galactic and the LMC population. The results revealed significant
differences, but also unexpected similarities between the WR populations of
these different galaxies. Analyzing the WR stars in M31 will extend our
understanding of these objects in different galactic environments. Aims: The
present study aims at the late-type WN stars in M31. The stellar and wind
parameters will tell about the formation of WR stars in other galaxies with
different metallicity and star formation histories. The obtained parameters
will provide constraints to the evolution of massive stars in the environment
of M31. Methods: We used the latest version of the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet model
atmosphere code to analyze the stars via fitting optical spectra and
photometric data. To account for the relatively low temperatures of the late
WN10 and WN11 subtypes, our WN models have been extended into this temperature
regime. Results: Stellar and atmospheric parameters are derived for all known
late-type WN stars in M31 with available spectra. All of these stars still have
hydrogen in their outer envelopes, some of them up to 50% by mass. The stars
are located on the cool side of the zero age main sequence in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, while their luminosities range from $10^5$ to
$10^6$ Lsun. It is remarkable that no star exceeds $10^6$ Lsun. Conclusions: If
formed via single-star evolution, the late-type WN stars in M31 stem from an
initial mass range between 20 and 60 Msun. From the very late-type WN9-11
stars, only one star is located in the S Doradus instability strip. We do not

key processes of galaxy evolution and identifying robust successes and
challenges in reproducing observations at high redshift. The source and sink
terms of the continuity equations for gas and stars are expressed in simple
terms from first principles. The assumed dependence of star-formation rate
(SFR) on gas mass self-regulates the system into a unique asymptotic behavior,
which is approximated by an analytic quasi-steady-state solution (QSS). We
address the validity of the QSS at different epochs independent of earlier
conditions. At high z, where the accretion is assumed to consist of gas only,
the specific SFR is robustly predicted to be sSFR = [(1+z)/3]^{5/2} Gyr^{-1},
slightly higher than the cosmological specific accretion rate, in agreement
with observations at z=3-8. The gas fraction is expected to decline slowly, and
the observations constrain the SFR efficiency per dynamical time to
epsilon=0.02. The stellar-to-virial mass ratio f_sv is predicted to be constant
in time, and the observed value requires an outflow mass-lading factor of
eta=1-3, depending on the penetration efficiency of gas into the galaxy.
However, at z=2, where stars are also accreted through mergers, the simplest
model has an apparent difficulty in matching observations. The model that
maximizes the sSFR, with the outflows fully recycled, falls short by a factor 3
in sSFR, and overestimates f_sv. With strong outflows, the model can reproduce
the observed f_sv but at the expense of underestimating the sSFR by an order of
magnitude. We discuss potential remedies including a bias due to the exclusion
of quenched galaxies.

present to produce the dark matter (DM) at the LHC. This mediator particle may
be produced on shell, so that direct searches for the mediating particle can
constrain the effective operator being applied to monojet constraints. In this
first paper, we do a case study on t-channel models in monojet searches, where
the (Standard Model singlet) DM is pair produced via a t-channel mediating
particle, whose supersymmetric analogue is the squark. We compare monojet
constraints to direct constraints on single or pair production of the mediator
from multi-jets plus missing energy searches and we identify the regions where
the latter dominate over the former. We show that computing bounds using
supersymmetric simplified models and in the narrow width approximation, as done
in previous work in the literature, misses important quantitative effects. We
perform a full event simulation and statistical analysis, and we compute the
effects of both on- and off-shell production of the mediating particle, showing
that for both the monojet and multi-jets plus missing energy searches,
previously derived bounds provided more conservative bounds than what can be
extracted by including all relevant processes in the simulation. Monojets and
searches for supersymmetry (SUSY) provide comparable bounds on a wide range of
the parameter space, with SUSY searches usually providing stronger bounds,
except in the regions where the DM particle and the mediator are very mass
degenerate. The EFT approximation rarely is able to reproduce the actual

satellite star cluster orbiting the host galaxy at 6 kpc from the galactic

the survival or dissolution of a star cluster orbiting within the inner 6 kpc

the mass loss of star clusters up to 15 kpc from the galactic center. N-body
simulations performed with a fine output time step show that at each disk
crossing the outer layers of star clusters experience an increase in velocity
dispersion of ~5% of the average velocity dispersion in the outer section of

discernable effect of disk shocking. By running models with different

Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) in 2013 February, a new transient
source, NuSTAR J163433-4738.7, was detected at a significance level of 8-sigma
in the 3-10 keV bandpass. The source is consistent with having a constant
NuSTAR count rate over a period of 40 ks and is also detected simultaneously by
Swift at lower significance. The source is not significantly detected by
NuSTAR, Swift, or Chandra in the days before or weeks after the discovery of
the transient, indicating that the strong X-ray activity lasted for between
~0.5 and 1.5 days. Near-IR imaging observations were carried out before and
after the X-ray activity, but we are not able to identify the counterpart. The
combined NuSTAR and Swift energy spectrum is consistent with a power-law with a
photon index of Gamma = 4.1(+1.5)(-1.0) (90% confidence errors), a blackbody
with kT = 1.2+/-0.3 keV, or a bremsstrahlung model with kT = 3.0(+2.1)(-1.2)
keV. The reduced-chi2 values for the three models are not significantly
different, ranging from 1.23 to 1.44 for 8 degrees of freedom. The spectrum is
strongly absorbed with NH = 2.8(+2.3)(-1.4)e23 cm-2, 9(+15)(-7)e22 cm-2, and
1.7(+1.7)(-0.9)e23 cm-2, for the power-law, blackbody, and bremsstrahlung
models, respectively. Although the high column density could be due to material
local to the source, it is consistent with absorption from interstellar
material along the line of sight at a distance of 11 kpc, which would indicate
an X-ray luminosity >1e34 erg/s. Although we do not reach a definitive
determination of the nature of NuSTAR J163433-4738.7, we suggest that it may be
an unusually bright active binary or a magnetar.

residual instrumental degradation that affects the observational data. Also,
the validity of the usual observational proxies is tested by obtaining
synthetic observations from the numerical boxes and comparing the velocity
proxies to the actual velocity values from the numerical grid.
  For the observations, data from the SUNRISE/IMaX instrument with about 120 km
spatial resolution are used, thus allowing the calculation of observational
Fourier spectra well into the subgranular range. For the simulations, we use
four series of runs obtained with the STAGGER code and synthesize the IMaX
spectral line (FeI 5250.2 A) from them. Proxies for the velocity field are
obtained via Dopplergrams (vertical component) and local correlation tracking
(horizontal component).
  A very good match between observational and simulated Fourier power spectra
is obtained for the vertical velocity data for scales between 200 km and 6 Mm.
Instead, a clear vertical shift is obtained when the synthetic observations are
not degraded. The match for the horizontal velocity data is much less
impressive because of the inaccuracies of the LCT procedure. Concerning the
internal comparison of the direct velocity values of the numerical boxes with
those from the synthetic observations, a high correlation (0.96) is obtained
for the vertical component when using the velocity values on the
log($tau_{500}$) = -1 surface in the box. The corresponding Fourier spectra are
near each other. A lower maximum correlation (0.5) is reached (at $tau_{500}$ =
1) for the horizontal velocities as a result of the coarseness of the LCT

regions, recombining systems (or Lyman limit systems) can have a large impact
during (and following) cosmic reionization. Unfortunately, directly resolving
such structures in large-scale reionization simulations is computationally
impractical. Instead, here we implement a sub-grid prescription for tracking
inhomogeneous recombinations in the intergalactic medium. Building on previous
work parameterizing photo-heating feedback on star-formation, we present
large-scale, semi-numeric reionization simulations which self-consistently
track the local (sub-grid) evolution of both sources and sinks of ionizing
photons. Our simple, single-parameter model naturally results in both an
extended reionization and a modest, slowly-evolving emissivity, consistent with
observations. Recombinations are instrumental in slowing the growth of large
HII regions, and damping the rapid rise of the ionizing background in the late
stages of (and following) reionization. As a result, typical HII regions are
smaller by factors of $\sim 2-3$ throughout reionization. The large-scale
($k\lesssim 0.2\text{ Mpc$^{-1}$}$) ionization power spectrum is suppressed by
factors of $\gtrsim 2-3$ in the second half of reionization. Therefore properly
modeling recombinations is important in interpreting virtually all reionization
observables, including upcoming interferometry with the redshifted 21 cm line.
Consistent with previous works, we find the clumping factor of ionized gas to
be $C_{\rm HII}\sim 4$ at the end of reionization.

Heisenberg (XXZ) chain after a geometric quench. This corresponds to a sudden
change of the geometry of the chain or, in the equivalent language of
interacting fermions confined in a box trap, to a sudden increase of the trap
size. The entanglement dynamics after the quench is associated with the
ballistic propagation of a magnetization wavefront. At the free fermion point
(XX chain), the von-Neumann entropy S_A exhibits several intriguing dynamical
regimes. Specifically, at short times a logarithmic increase is observed,
similar to local quenches. This is accurately described by an analytic formula
that we derive from heuristic arguments. At intermediate times partial revivals
of the short-time dynamics are superposed with a power-law increase S_A
t^\alpha, with \alpha<1. Finally, at very long times a steady state develops
with constant entanglement entropy. As expected, since the model is integrable,
we find that the steady state is non thermal, although it exhibits extensive
entanglement entropy. We also investigate the entanglement dynamics after the
quench from a finite to the infinite chain (sudden expansion). While at long
times the entanglement vanishes, we demonstrate that its relaxation dynamics
exhibits a number of scaling properties. Finally, we discuss the short-time
entanglement dynamics in the XXZ chain in the gapless phase. The same formula
that describes the time dependence for the XX chain remains valid in the whole
gapless phase.

MOS and PN observations independently show the presence of the line at
consistent energies. When the full sample is divided into three subsamples
(Perseus, Centaurus+Ophiuchus+Coma, and all others), the line is significantly
detected in all three independent MOS spectra and the PN ""all others"" spectrum.
It is also detected in the Chandra spectra of Perseus with the flux consistent
with XMM (though it is not seen in Virgo). However, it is very weak and located
within 50-110eV of several known faint lines, and so is subject to significant
modeling uncertainties. On the origin of this line, we argue that there should
be no atomic transitions in thermal plasma at this energy. An intriguing
possibility is the decay of sterile neutrino, a long-sought dark matter
particle candidate. Assuming that all dark matter is in sterile neutrinos with
m_s=2E=7.1 keV, our detection in the full sample corresponds to a neutrino
decay mixing angle sin^2(2theta)=7e-11, below the previous upper limits.
However, based on the cluster masses and distances, the line in Perseus is much
brighter than expected in this model. This appears to be because of an
anomalously bright line at E=3.62 keV in Perseus, possibly an Ar XVII
dielectronic recombination line, although its flux would be 30 times the
expected value and physically difficult to understand. In principle, such an
anomaly might explain our line detection in other subsamples as well, though it
would stretch the line energy uncertainties. Another alternative is the above
anomaly in the Ar line combined with the nearby 3.51 keV K line also exceeding
expectation by factor 10-20. Confirmation with Chandra and Suzaku, and
eventually Astro-H, are required to determine the nature of this new

The natural-orbital basis set is truncated to generate a molecule-optimized

flow with regularity below the Onsager critical space $L_t^\infty

we establish two theorems that may be viewed as first steps towards
establishing the conjectured failure of energy regularity for generic solutions

  Our first result shows that any non-negative function with compact support
and H\""older regularity $1/2$ can be prescribed as the energy profile of an
Euler flow in the class $C^{1/5-\epsilon}_{t,x}$. The exponent $1/2$ is sharp
in view of a regularity result of [Isett,13]. The proof employs an improved
greedy algorithm scheme that builds upon that in [Buckmaster-De

flow can be perturbed in $C^{1/5-\epsilon}_{t,x}$ on any pre-compact subset of
${\mathbb R}\times {\mathbb R}^3$ to violate energy conservation. In
particular, there exist nonzero $C^{1/5-\epsilon}_{t,x}$ solutions to Euler
with compact space-time support, generalizing previous work of the first author

viewed as the Heisenberg double of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ provided with a non-trivial

  It is well known that Matrix Completion in its full generality is NP-hard.
However, little is known if make additional assumptions such as incoherence and
permit the algorithm to output a matrix of slightly higher rank. In this paper
we prove that Matrix Completion remains computationally intractable even if the
unknown matrix has rank $4$ but we are allowed to output any constant rank

under the standard assumption that $\mathrm{P}\ne \mathrm{NP}.$
  Our results greatly narrow the gap between existing feasibility results and
computational lower bounds. In particular, we believe that our results give the
first complexity-theoretic justification for why distributional assumptions are
needed beyond the incoherence assumption in order to obtain positive results.
On the technical side, we contribute several new ideas on how to encode hard
combinatorial problems in low-rank optimization problems. We hope that these
techniques will be helpful in further understanding the computational limits of
Matrix Completion and related problems.

(H.E.S.S.) is dedicated to studying active galactic nuclei (AGN), with the aim
of increasing the sample of known extragalactic very-high-energy (VHE, E>100
GeV) sources and constraining the physical processes at play in potential
emitters. H.E.S.S. observations of AGN, spanning a period from April 2004 to
December 2011, are investigated to constrain their gamma-ray fluxes. Only the
47 sources without significant excess detected at the position of the targets
are presented. Upper limits on VHE fluxes of the targets were computed and a
search for variability was performed on the nightly time scale. For 41 objects,
the flux upper limits we derived are the most constraining reported to date.
These constraints at VHE are compared with the flux level expected from
extrapolations of Fermi-LAT measurements in the two-year catalog of AGN. The
H.E.S.S. upper limits are at least a factor of two lower than the extrapolated
Fermi-LAT fluxes for 11 objects. Taking into account the attenuation by the
extragalactic background light reduces the tension for all but two of them,
suggesting intrinsic curvature in the high-energy spectra of these two AGN.
Compilation efforts led by current VHE instruments are of critical importance
for target-selection strategies before the advent of the Cherenkov Telescope
Array, CTA.

as a way to model relationships between frames in a video. By minimizing
reconstruction error of one frame, given the previous frame, these models learn
""mapping units"" that encode the transformations inherent in a sequence, and
thereby learn to encode motion. In this work we extend bi-linear models by
introducing ""higher-order mapping units"" that allow us to encode
transformations between frames and transformations between transformations.
  We show that this makes it possible to encode temporal structure that is more
complex and longer-range than the structure captured within standard bi-linear
models. We also show that a natural way to train the model is by replacing the
commonly used reconstruction objective with a prediction objective which forces
the model to correctly predict the evolution of the input multiple steps into
the future. Learning can be achieved by back-propagating the multi-step
prediction through time. We test the model on various temporal prediction
tasks, and show that higher-order mappings and predictive training both yield a
significant improvement over bi-linear models in terms of prediction accuracy.

new insight into the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition of the 2d

few examples of a phase transition beyond second order. It is of infinite order

excellent scaling behavior of the helicity modulus, which characterizes this

of the system over the course of the observation. These data are successfully
modeled as a combination of brightness and color variability in the T0.5 Luhman
16B, consistent cloud variations; and no significant variability in L7.5 Luhman
16A. We estimate a peak-to-peak amplitude of 13.5% at 1.25 micron over the full

cloud covering fraction of ~30-55% for Luhman 16B, varying by 15-30% over a

features explains an apparent correlation between period and amplitude for
three highly variable T dwarfs, and predicts relatively fast winds (1-3 km/s)

measurements. This is different from that in the same collisions but at the
maximum energy of sqrt(s_NN)= 200 GeV. Where, in addition to the revised Landau
hydrodynamic model, the effects of leading particles have to be taken into
account in order to explain the experimental observations. It can be attributed
to the different degrees of transparency of participants in different incident
energies.

with two thermal components (representing the accretion disc and boundary

Gaussian or a relativistic line component to model an iron emission line at
about 6.5 keV. For the relativistic line component we used either the diskline,
laor or kyrline model, the latter for three different values of the spin
parameter. The fitting results for the continuum are consistent with the
standard truncated disc scenario. We also find that the flux and equivalent
width of the iron line first increase and then decrease as the flux of the
Comptonised component increases. This could be explained either by changes in
the ionisation state of the accretion disc where the line is produced by
reflection, or by light bending of the emission from the Comptonised component
if the height at which this component is produced changes with mass accretion
rate.

galaxy clusters as cosmic telescopes to study z >~ 7 galaxies at intrinsically
lower luminosities, enabled by gravitational lensing, than blank field surveys
of the same exposure time. Our main goal is to measure stellar masses and ages
of these galaxies, which are the most likely sources of the ionizing photons
that drive reionization. Accurate knowledge of the star formation density and
star formation history at this epoch is necessary to determine whether these
galaxies indeed reionized the universe. Determination of the stellar masses and
ages requires measuring rest frame optical light, which only Spitzer can probe
for sources at z >~ 7, for a large enough sample of typical galaxies. Our
program consists of 550 hours of Spitzer/IRAC imaging covering 10 galaxy
clusters with very well-known mass distributions, making them extremely precise
cosmic telescopes. We combine our data with archival observations to obtain
mosaics with ~30 hours exposure time in both 3.6$\mu$m and 4.5$\mu$m in the
central 4 arcmin x 4 arcmin field and ~15 hours in the flanking fields. This
results in 3-$\sigma$ sensitivity limits of ~26.6 and ~26.2AB magnitudes for
the central field in the IRAC 3.6 and 4.5$\mu$m bands, respectively. To
illustrate the survey strategy and characteristics we introduce the sample,
present the details of the data reduction and demonstrate that these data are
sufficient for in-depth studies of z >~ 7 sources (using a z=9.5 galaxy behind
MACSJ1149.5+2223 as an example). For the first cluster of the survey (the
Bullet Cluster) we have released all high-level data mosaics and IRAC empirical
PSF models. In the future we plan to release these data products for the entire

J222843.54+011032.2 (J2228+0110) at redshift z=5.95. Our aim was to investigate
the milli-arcsecond (mas) scale properties of all the VLBI-detectable sources
within this primary beam area with a diameter of 20 arcmin. The source
J2228+0110 was detected with VLBI with a brightness temperature T_b>10^8 K,
supporting the active galactic nucleus (AGN) origin of its radio emission,
which is conclusive evidence that the source is a radio quasar. In addition,
two other target sources were also detected, one of them with no redshift
information. Their brightness temperature values (T_b >10^7 K) measured with
VLBI suggest a non-thermal synchrotron radiation origin for their radio
emission. The detection rate of 20% is broadly consistent with other wide-field
VLBI experiments carried out recently. We also derived the accurate equatorial
coordinates of the three detected sources using the phase-referencing
technique. This experiment is an early attempt of a wide-field science project

strength, and we demonstrate that the many-body dynamics extends well beyond a
nearest-neighbor or mean-field picture, and cannot be quantitatively described
using previously available theoretical tools. We develop a novel cluster
expansion technique and demonstrate that our theoretical method accurately
captures the measured dependence of the spin dynamics on molecule number and on
the dipolar interaction strength. In the spirit of quantum simulation, this

microscopic understanding of the experiment. Our findings pave the way for
numerous applications in quantum information science, metrology, and condensed

realization of thick (above 500 nm) mesoporous Ge layers with perfectly

characterization of thin layers is much more complicated and the number of
possible applications is very limited. We have developed an electrochemical
model that describes the principal mechanisms of the pore formation which
allowed us to produce the thick (up to 10 um) mesoporous Ge structures with the
porosity adjustable in the range of 15% to 60% In addition, the formation of
porous nanostructures with well-controlled variable morphologies has now become
possible. Finally, the mastery of these parameters has opened the extremely
promising path towards realization of porous multilayer structures based on Ge
for many innovative and multidisciplinary applications. In particular, in the
context of this thesis, the mesoporous layers of Ge were optimized for
performing a layer transfer process of a triple-junction solar cell via a

more quiescent spiral galaxies. Distance and blending effects were investigated
in detail paving the way for SSC studies further out than done previously. We
have also correlated the luminosities of the brightest clusters with the star
formation rates (SFR) of the hosts. The relation is similar, though somewhat
steeper than that found in the optical and at lower SFR levels, suggesting
systematic extinction and/or age effects. We find that the characteristics of
the relation suggest an underlying physical driver rather than solely a
size-of-sample effect. In particular, a truncated luminosity/mass function
would naturally explain the small scatter we find. Finally, we are modelling
the ages and masses of our near-IR detected clusters in conjunction with HST
optical data and present early results of using SSC properties to trace the

massive star formation have been made with the Parkes 64-m radio telescope.
Here we present the resulting spectra for 104 northerly sources. For more than
20 masers we made new measurements with the ATCA (which also revealed several
hitherto unreported masers), in most cases yielding arcsecond precision to
match the majority of sites. Position improvements assist in distinguishing OH
masers with accompanying methanol masers from those without (thought to be at a
later stage of evolution). There was no existing linear polarization
information at many sites, and spectral resolution was sometimes poor, or
velocity coverage incomplete. These inadequacies are addressed by the present
Parkes spectra. The whole OH maser sample exhibit the well-known predominance
of highly circularly polarized features. We find that linear polarization is
also common, but usually much weaker, and we highlight the rare cases of very
pronounced linear polarization that can extend to 100 per cent. Unusually large
velocity ranges of at least 25 km/s are present at seven sites. Our spectra
measurements for most sources are at two epochs spaced by nearly one year, and
reveal high stability at most sites, and marked variability (more than factors
of two in the strongest feature) at only five sites. The spectra also provide a
valuable reference for longer term variability, with high stability evident
over the past decades at 10 sites and marked variability for four of the
sample. Future systematic monitoring of these variables may uncover further
examples of periodicity, a phenomenon so far recognised in only one source.

profile on the spatial development of the current driven kink instability along
helically magnetized relativistic jets via three-dimensional relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations. In this study, we use a non-periodic
computational box, the jet flow is initially established across the
computational grid, and a precessional perturbation at the inlet triggers
growth of the kink instability. If the velocity shear radius is located inside
the characteristic radius of the helical magnetic field, a static
non-propagating current driven kink is excited as the perturbation propagates
down the jet. Temporal growth disrupts the initial flow across the
computational grid not too far from the inlet. On the other hand, if the
velocity shear radius is outside the characteristic radius of the helical
magnetic field, the kink is advected with the flow and grows spatially down the
jet. In this case flow is maintained to much larger distances from the inlet.
The effect of different radial density profiles is more subtle. When the
density increases with radius, the kink appears to saturate by the end of the
simulation without apparent disruption of the helical twist. This behavior
suggests that relativistic jets consisting of a tenuous spine surrounded by a
denser medium with a velocity shear radius outside the radius of maximum
toroidal magnetic field have a relatively stable configuration.

Because of their low effective temperatures, the habitable zone of M stars is
very close to the star itself. For planets close to their stars, tidal heating
plays an important role in thermal and orbital evolutions, especially when the
planet orbit has a relatively large eccentricity. Although tidal heating
interacts with the thermal state and orbit of the planet, such coupled
calculations for extrasolar planets around M star have not been conducted. We
perform coupled calculations using simple structural and orbital models, and
analyze the thermal state and habitability of a terrestrial planet. Considering
this planet to be Martian sized, the tide heats up and partially melts the
mantle, maintaining an equilibrium state if the mass of the star is less than
0.2 times the mass of the Sun and the initial eccentricity of the orbit is more
than 0.2. The reduction of heat dissipation due to the melted mantle allows the
planet to stay in the habitable zone for more than 10 Gyr even though the
orbital distance is small. The surface heat flux at the equilibrium state is
between that of Mars and Io. The thermal state of the planet mainly depends on
the initial value of the eccentricity and the mass of the star.

(EVN) at 1.6 GHz to measure its proper motion and parallax. A model-independent
distance would also help constrain its $\gamma$-ray luminosity. We achieved a
detection of signal-to-noise ratio S/N > 37 for the weak pulsar in all five
epochs. Using an extragalactic radio source lying 20 arcmin away from the
pulsar, we estimate the pulsar's proper motion to be
$\mu_{\alpha}\cos\delta=5.35\pm0.05$ mas yr$^{-1}$ and $\mu_{\delta}=-3.74\pm
0.12$ mas yr$^{-1}$, and a parallax of $\pi=0.16\pm0.09$ mas. The very long
baseline interferometry (VLBI) proper motion has significantly improved upon
the estimates from long-term pulsar timing observations. The VLBI parallax
provides the first model-independent distance constraints:
$d=6.3^{+8.0}_{-2.3}$ kpc, with a corresponding $3\sigma$ lower-limit of
$d=2.3$ kpc. This is the first pulsar trigonometric parallax measurement based

study the influence of the underlying halo catalogue upon the resulting trees.
We observe that the specifics of halo finding itself greatly influences the
constructed merger trees. We find that the choices made to define the halo mass
are of prime importance. For instance, amongst many potential options different
finders select self-bound objects or spherical regions of defined overdensity,
decide whether or not to include substructures within the mass returned and
vary in their initial particle selection. The impact of these decisions is seen
in tree length (the period of time a particularly halo can be traced back
through the simulation), branching ratio (essentially the merger rate of
\subhalos) and mass evolution. We therefore conclude that the choice of the
underlying halo finder is more relevant to the process of building merger trees
than the tree builder itself. We also report on some built-in features of
specific merger tree codes that (sometimes) help to improve the quality of the
merger trees produced.

different data sets: the synoptic maps of line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic field
from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board of Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) and vector magnetic field measurements from Vector
Spectromagnetograph (VSM) on Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the

is opposite to helicity of solar active regions, but it is in agreement with
the predictions of mean-field dynamo models. The data also suggest that the
hemispheric helicity rule may have reversed its sign in early and late phases
of cycle 23. Furthermore, the data indicate an imbalance in magnetic helicity
between the northern and southern hemispheres. This imbalance seem to correlate
with the total level of activity in each hemisphere in cycle 23. Magnetic
helicity for rising phase of cycle 24 is derived from SOLIS/VSM data, and
qualitatively, its latitudinal pattern is similar to the pattern derived from

consumer species compete for an abiotic or biotic resource. We consider both
consumer species specialized to a habitat patch, and generalist species capable

effects of consumer and resource dispersal on the metacommunity diversity of
consumer species, and shows that hump-shaped relationships between local

of graph data has driven the development of numerous new graph-parallel systems
(e.g., Pregel, GraphLab). By restricting the computation that can be expressed
and introducing new techniques to partition and distribute the graph, these
systems can efficiently execute iterative graph algorithms orders of magnitude
faster than more general data-parallel systems. However, the same restrictions
that enable the performance gains also make it difficult to express many of the
important stages in a typical graph-analytics pipeline: constructing the graph,
modifying its structure, or expressing computation that spans multiple graphs.
As a consequence, existing graph analytics pipelines compose graph-parallel and
data-parallel systems using external storage systems, leading to extensive data
movement and complicated programming model.
  To address these challenges we introduce GraphX, a distributed graph
computation framework that unifies graph-parallel and data-parallel
computation. GraphX provides a small, core set of graph-parallel operators
expressive enough to implement the Pregel and PowerGraph abstractions, yet
simple enough to be cast in relational algebra. GraphX uses a collection of
query optimization techniques such as automatic join rewrites to efficiently
implement these graph-parallel operators. We evaluate GraphX on real-world
graphs and workloads and demonstrate that GraphX achieves comparable
performance as specialized graph computation systems, while outperforming them
in end-to-end graph pipelines. Moreover, GraphX achieves a balance between
expressiveness, performance, and ease of use.

halos. We extend the conventional spherical collapse model by including the
Lorentz force which has not been implemented in the previous analysis to study
the evolution of density perturbations produced by primordial magnetic fields.
The critical over-density $\delta_{\rm c}$ characterizing the halo mass
function turns out to be a bigger value, $\delta_{\rm c}\simeq 1.78$, than the
conventional one $\delta_{\rm c}\simeq 1.69$ for the perturbations evolved only

  The difference in $\delta_{\rm c}$ between our model and the fully matter
dominated cosmological model is small at a low redshift and, hence, only the
high mass tail of the mass function is affected by the magnetic fields. At a
high redshift, on the other hand, the difference in $\delta_{\rm c}$ becomes
large enough to suppress the halo abundance over a wide range of mass scales.
The halo abundance is reduced for instance by as large a factor as $\sim10^5$

how we can construct a certain new static solution of Einstein field equations
using a seed metric. Later we investigate the family of stationary spacetimes
of such reciprocal metrics. The key here is a theorem from Ehlers', which
relates any static vacuum solution to a unique stationary metric. The
stationary metric has a magnetic charge. The spacetime represents Newman
-Unti-Tamburino (NUT) solutions. Since any stationary spacetime can be
decomposed into a $1+3$ time-space decomposition, Einstein field equations for
any stationary spacetime can be written in the form of Maxwell's equations for
gravitoelectromagnetic fields. Further we show that this set of equations is
invariant under reciprocal transformations. An additional point is that the NUT
charge changes the sign. As an instructive example, by starting from the
reciprocal Schwarzschild as a spherically symmetric solution and reciprocal
Morgan-Morgan disk model as seed metrics we find their corresponding stationary
space-times. Starting from any static seed metric, performing the reciprocal
transformation and by applying an additional Ehlers' transforation we obtain a
family of NUT spaces with negative NUT factor (reciprocal NUT factors).

is very similar. The spatial distribution of soft regions changes, instead, for
minima between which transitions relevant to structural relaxation occur. This
may be the reason why the soft modes are able to predict spatial
heterogeneities in the dynamics. Nevertheless, the very softest modes are only
weakly correlated with dynamical heterogeneities, and instead show higher
statistical overlap with regions in the local minima that would undergo

However, a complete analytical description and understanding of internal waves
in arbitrarily shaped enclosed domains, such as the ocean, or a planet liquid
core, is still missing.
  In this work, the inviscid, linear inertial wave field is investigated by
means of three dimensional ray tracing in spherical shell domains, having in
mind possible oceanographic applications. Rays are here classically interpreted
as representative of energy paths. But in contrast with previous studies, they
are now launched with a non-zero initial zonal component allowing for a more
realistic, localized forcing, and the development of azimuthal inhomogeneities.
  We find that meridional planes generally act in the shell geometry as
attractors for ray trajectories. In addition, the existence of trajectories
that are not subject to meridional trapping is here observed for the first
time. Their dynamics was not captured by the previous purely meridional studies
and unveils a new class of possible solutions for inertial motion in the
spherical shell.
  Both observed behaviours shed some new light on possible mechanisms of energy
localization, a key process that still deserves further investigation in our
ocean, as well as in other stratified, rotating media.

multiplet of inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon fields, which couple to the spacetime
metric and also to an external source term; thus the solutions form an affine
space. Following the formulation of affine field theories in terms of
presymplectic vector spaces as proposed in [Annales Henri Poincare 15, 171
(2014)], we determine the relative Cauchy evolution induced by metric as well
as source term perturbations and compute the automorphism group of natural
isomorphisms of the presymplectic vector space functor. Two pathological
features of this formulation are revealed: the automorphism group contains
elements that cannot be interpreted as global gauge transformations of the
theory; moreover, the presymplectic formulation does not respect a natural
requirement on composition of subsystems. We therefore propose a systematic
strategy to improve the original description of affine field theories at the
classical and quantized level, first passing to a Poisson algebra description
in the classical case. The idea is to consider state spaces on the classical
and quantum algebras suggested by the physics of the theory (in the classical
case, we use the affine solution space). The state spaces are not separating
for the algebras, indicating a redundancy in the description. Removing this
redundancy by a quotient, a functorial theory is obtained that is free of the
above mentioned pathologies. These techniques are applicable to general affine
field theories and Abelian gauge theories. The resulting quantized theory is
shown to be dynamically local.

chromatic properties of graphs with geometric representations and competitive
analysis of on-line algorithms, which became apparent after the recent
construction of triangle-free geometric intersection graphs with arbitrarily
large chromatic number due to Pawlik et al. We show that on-line graph coloring
problems give rise to classes of game graphs with a natural geometric
interpretation. We use this concept to estimate the chromatic number of graphs
with geometric representations by finding, for appropriate simpler graphs,
on-line coloring algorithms using few colors or proving that no such algorithms
exist.
  We derive upper and lower bounds on the maximum chromatic number that
rectangle overlap graphs, subtree overlap graphs, and interval filament graphs
(all of which generalize interval overlap graphs) can have when their clique
number is bounded. The bounds are absolute for interval filament graphs and
asymptotic of the form $(\log\log n)^{f(\omega)}$ for rectangle and subtree
overlap graphs, where $f(\omega)$ is a polynomial function of the clique number
and $n$ is the number of vertices. In particular, we provide the first
construction of geometric intersection graphs with bounded clique number and
with chromatic number asymptotically greater than $\log\log n$.
  We also introduce a concept of $K_k$-free colorings and show that for some
geometric representations, $K_3$-free chromatic number can be bounded in terms
of clique number although the ordinary ($K_2$-free) chromatic number cannot.
Such a result for segment intersection graphs would imply a well-known
conjecture that $k$-quasi-planar geometric graphs have linearly many edges.

time dependent and diminish with time. In contrast, the Newton's constant
increases with time. We clarify the physical mechanism behind these effects in
terms of the conformal mode dynamics in analogy with 2d quantum gravity. We
show that they are the inevitable consequence of the general covariance and
lead to gauge invariant predictions. We construct a simple model in which the
cosmological constant is self-tuned to vanish due to UV-IR mixing effect. We

half-integral fermion numbers are possible due to the presence of an isolated
self charge conjugate zero mode. The model possesses the charge and particle
conjugation symmetries. These symmetries mandate the reflection symmetry of the
spectrum about the line $E=0$. We obtain the bound state energies and wave
functions of the fermion in this model using two different methods,
analytically and exactly, for every arbitrary choice of the parameters of the
kink, i.e. its value at spatial infinity ($\theta_0$) and its scale of
variations ($\mu$). Then, we plot the bound state energies of the fermion as a
function of $\theta_0$. This graph enables us to consider a process of building
up the kink from the trivial vacuum. We can then determine the origin and
evolution of the bound state energy levels during this process. We see that the
model has a dynamical mass generation process at the first quantized level and
the zero-energy fermionic mode responsible for the fractional fermion number,
is always present during the construction of the kink and its origin is very
peculiar, indeed. We also observe that, as expected, none of the energy levels
crosses each other. Moreover, we obtain analytically the continuum scattering
wave functions of the fermion and then calculate the phase shifts of these wave
functions. Using the information contained in the graphs of the phase shifts
and the bound states, we show that our phase shifts are consistent with the
weak and strong forms of the Levinson theorem. Finally, using the weak form of
the Levinson theorem, we confirm that the number of the zero-energy fermionic
modes is exactly one.

It is known that AS and IIS are equivalent with respect to \emph{wait-free

in order to explore solvability of tasks in \emph{sub-models} of AS (i.e.

a stronger equivalence relation is needed. In this paper, we consider
\emph{adversarial} sub-models of AS and IIS specified by the sets of processes

pseudo-polynomial time algorithm to realize any imbalance set. Along the way,
we generalize the well-known equal sum subsets problem (ESS) to define the
equal sum sequences problem (ESSeq) and show it to be NP-complete. We then
prove that ESSeq reduces to TIS and so, due to the pseudo-polynomial time

understanding the finest and fundamental scales of heating events in the solar
corona. The Hi-C instrument has provided the highest spatial and temporal
resolution images of the solar corona in the EUV wavelength range to date. Hi-C
observed an active region on 11 July 2012, which exhibits several interesting
features in the EUV line at 193\AA: one of them is the existence of short,
small brightenings ``sparkling"" at the edge of the active region; we call these
EUV Bright Dots (EBDs). Individual EBDs have a characteristic duration of 25s
with a characteristic length of 680 km. These brightenings are not fully
resolved by the SDO/AIA instrument at the same wavelength, however, they can be
identified with respect to the Hi-C location of the EBDs. In addition, EBDs are
seen in other chromospheric/coronal channels of SDO/AIA suggesting a
temperature between 0.5 and 1.5 MK. Based on their frequency in the Hi-C time
series, we define four different categories of EBDs: single peak, double peak,
long duration, and bursty EBDs. Based on a potential field extrapolation from
an SDO/HMI magnetogram, the EBDs appear at the footpoints of large-scale
trans-equatorial coronal loops. The Hi-C observations provide the first
evidence of small-scale EUV heating events at the base of these coronal loops,
which have a free magnetic energy of the order of 10$^{26}$ erg.

minimize conflict and stitch numbers. Since ILP has very poor scalability, we
propose three acceleration techniques without sacrificing solution quality:
independent component computation, layout graph simplification, and bridge
computation. For very dense layouts, even with these speedup techniques, ILP
formulation may still be too slow. Therefore, we propose a novel vector
programming formulation for TPL decomposition, and solve it through effective
semidefinite programming (SDP) approximation. Experimental results show that
the ILP with acceleration techniques can reduce 82% runtime compared to the
baseline ILP. Using SDP based algorithm, the runtime can be further reduced by
42% with some tradeoff in the stitch number (reduced by 7%) and the conflict

differential expressions involving an arbitrary spatial function that arises as
a conserved quantity. This enables us to unify, simplify and extend previous

perturbations that emerge at the end of the inflationary epoch to determine the
additional arbitrary spatial function that arises when integrating the second

the expressions for the second order density perturbation. In the special case
of zero spatial curvature we show that the time evolution simplifies
significantly, and requires the use of only two non-elementary functions, the
so-called growth supression factor at the linear level, and one new function at

realistic impacting and close approaching asteroids detected in a simulated
all-sky survey. We use the impact probability to calculate the impact warning
time as the time interval between when an object reaches a Palermo Scale value
of -2 and when it impacts Earth. A simple argument shows that warning time ~
D^x with the exponent in the range [1.0,1.5] and our derived value was
$x=1.3\pm0.1$. The low-precision astrometry from the single simulated all-sky
survey could require many days or weeks to establish an imminent impact for
asteroids >100m diameter that are discovered far from Earth. Most close
approaching asteroids are quickly identified as not being impactors but a
size-dependent percentage, even for those >50m diameter, have a persistent
impact probability of >10^{-6} on the day of closest approach. Thus, a single
all-sky survey can be of tremendous value in identifying Earth impacting and
close approaching asteroids in advance of their closest approach but it can not
solve the problem on its own: high-precision astrometry from other optical or
radar systems is necessary to rapidly establish an object as an impactor or
close approacher. We show that the parallax afforded by surveying the sky from
two sites is only of benefit for a small fraction of the smallest objects
detected within a couple days before impact: probably not enough to justify the
increased operating costs of a 2-site survey. Finally, the survey cadence
within a fixed time span is relatively unimportant to the impact probability
calculation. We tested three different reasonable cadences and found that one
provided ~10x higher (better) value for the impact probability on the discovery
night for the smallest (10m diameter) objects but the consequences on the
overall impact probability calculation is negligible.

has few neighbors outside $X$. In this paper, we prove several bounds on the
size of islands in large graphs embeddable on fixed surfaces. As direct
consequences of our results, we obtain that:
  (1) Every graph of genus $g$ can be colored from lists of size 5, in such a
way that each monochromatic component has size $O(g)$. Moreover all but $O(g)$
vertices lie in monochromatic components of size at most 3.
  (2) Every triangle-free graph of genus $g$ can be colored from lists of size
3, in such a way that each monochromatic component has size $O(g)$. Moreover
all but $O(g)$ vertices lie in monochromatic components of size at most 10.
  (3) Every graph of girth at least 6 and genus $g$ can be colored from lists
of size 2, in such a way that each monochromatic component has size $O(g)$.
Moreover all but $O(g)$ vertices lie in monochromatic components of size at
most 16.
  While (2) is optimal up to the size of the components, we conjecture that the
size of the lists can be decreased to 4 in (1), and the girth can be decreased
to 5 in (3). We also study the complexity of minimizing the size of
monochromatic components in 2-colorings of planar graphs.

absence of free neutron targets. Neutron information is usually extracted from
data on nuclear targets such as deuterium, requiring corrections for nuclear
binding and nucleon off-shell effects. These corrections are model dependent
and have significant uncertainties, especially for large values of the Bjorken
scaling variable x. The Barely Off-shell Nucleon Structure (BONuS) experiment
at Jefferson Lab measured the inelastic electron deuteron scattering cross
section, tagging spectator protons in coincidence with the scattered electrons.
This method reduces nuclear binding uncertainties significantly and has allowed
for the first time a (nearly) model independent extraction of the neutron
structure function. A novel compact radial time projection chamber was built to
detect protons with momentum between 70 and 150 MeV/c. For the extraction of
the free neutron structure function $F_{2n}$, spectator protons at backward
angle and with momenta below 100 MeV/c were selected, ensuring that the
scattering took place on a nearly free neutron. The scattered electrons were
detected with Jefferson Lab's CLAS spectrometer. The extracted neutron
structure function $F_{2n}$ and its ratio to the deuteron structure function
$F_{2d}$ are presented in both the resonance and deep inelastic regions. The
dependence of the cross section on the spectator proton momentum and angle is
investigated, and tests of the spectator mechanism for different kinematics are
performed. Our data set can be used to study neutron resonance excitations,
test quark hadron duality in the neutron, develop more precise parametrizations
of structure functions, as well as investigate binding effects (including
possible mechanisms for the nuclear EMC effect) and provide a first glimpse of
the asymptotic behavior of d/u as x goes to 1.

hysteresis on striped superhydrophobic surfaces as a function of a solid
fraction, $\phi_S$. It is shown that the receding regime is determined by a
longitudinal sliding motion the deformed contact line. Despite an anisotropy of
the texture the receding contact angle remains isotropic, i.e. is practically
the same in the longitudinal and transverse directions. The cosine of the
receding angle grows nonlinearly with $\phi_S$, in contrast to predictions of
the Cassie equation. To interpret this we develop a simple theoretical model,
which shows that the value of the receding angle depends both on weak defects
at smooth solid areas and on the elastic energy of strong defects at the
borders of stripes, which scales as $\phi_S^2 \ln \phi_S$. The advancing
contact angle was found to be anisotropic, except as in a dilute regime, and
its value is determined by the rolling motion of the drop. The cosine of the
longitudinal advancing angle depends linearly on $\phi_S$, but a satisfactory
fit to the data can only be provided if we generalize the Cassie equation to
account for weak defects. The cosine of the transverse advancing angle is much
smaller and is maximized at $\phi_S\simeq 0.5$. An explanation of its value can
be obtained if we invoke an additional energy due to strong defects in this
direction, which is shown to be proportional to $\phi_S^2$. Finally, the
contact angle hysteresis is found to be quite large and generally anisotropic,
but it becomes isotropic when $\phi_S\leq 0.2$.

  Management in Small Cell Networks",,,,,"cs.GT cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the problem of cooperative interference management in
an OFDMA two-tier small cell network. In particular, we propose a novel
approach for allowing the small cells to cooperate, so as to optimize their
sum-rate, while cooperatively satisfying their maximum transmit power
constraints. Unlike existing work which assumes that only disjoint groups of
cooperative small cells can emerge, we formulate the small cells' cooperation
problem as a coalition formation game with overlapping coalitions. In this
game, each small cell base station can choose to participate in one or more
cooperative groups (or coalitions) simultaneously, so as to optimize the
tradeoff between the benefits and costs associated with cooperation. We study
the properties of the proposed overlapping coalition formation game and we show
that it exhibits negative externalities due to interference. Then, we propose a
novel decentralized algorithm that allows the small cell base stations to
interact and self-organize into a stable overlapping coalitional structure.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm results in a notable
performance advantage in terms of the total system sum-rate, relative to the
noncooperative case and the classical algorithms for coalitional games with
non-overlapping coalitions.

the numbers of systems that may be detectable in data already collected by the
NASA Kepler Mission. Our predictions, which are based upon TRILEGAL and BiSEPS

``asteroseismic binaries'' may be detectable in this manner. Most of these
binaries should be comprised of two He-core-burning red giants. Owing largely
to the limited numbers of targets with the requisite short-cadence Kepler data,
we expect only a small number of detected binaries containing solar-type stars.
The predicted yield of detections is sensitive to the assumed initial mass
ratio distribution of the binary components and therefore represents a
sensitive calibration of the much debated initial mass ratio distribution near

analytically from semiclassical considerations based on the properties of the

and (ii) the resonant behavior of their excitation factors induces intrinsic
giant ringings, i.e., ringings of a huge amplitude. Such ringings, which are
moreover slowly decaying, are directly constructed from the retarded Green
function. If we describe the source of the black hole perturbation by an
initial value problem with Gaussian initial data, i.e., if we consider the
excitation of the black hole from an extrinsic point of view, we can show that
these extraordinary ringings are still present. This suggests that physically
realistic sources of perturbations should generate giant and slowly decaying

with the AzTEC/ASTE telescope, which we combined with archive data from near-

observations, combined with other data, show a sequence of objects from a cold
clump to young stellar objects at different evolutionary stages. Source B-3
(2MASS J04351455-1414468) appears to be a YSO forming inside the L1642 cloud,
instead of a foreground brown dwarf, as previously classified. Herschel data
reveal striation in the diffuse dust emission around L1642. The western region
shows striation towards NE and has a steeper column density gradient on its
southern side. The densest central region has a bow-shock like structure
showing compression from the west and a filamentary tail extending towards
east. The differences suggest that these may be spatially distinct structures,
aligned only in projection. We derive values of the dust emission cross-section
per H nucleon for different regions of the cloud. Modified black-body fits to
the spectral energy distribution of Herschel and Planck data give emissivity
spectral index beta values 1.8-2.0 for the different regions. The compact
sources have lower beta values and show an anticorrelation between T and beta.
Markov chain Monte Carlo calculations demonstrate the strong anticorrelation
between beta and T errors and the importance of mm Planck data in constraining
the estimates. L1642 reveals a more complex structure and sequence of star

temperature and chemistry of their dust and gas. Whether the disk is flat or
flaring depends on the amount of radiation that it absorbs at a given radius,
and on the efficiency with which this is converted into thermal energy. The
understanding of these heating and cooling processes is crucial to provide a
reliable disk structure for the interpretation of dust continuum emission and
gas line fluxes. Especially in the upper layers of the disk, where gas and dust
are thermally decoupled, the infrared line emission is strictly related to the
gas heating/cooling processes. We aim to study the thermal properties of the
disk in the oxygen line emission region, and to investigate the relative
importance of X-ray (1-120 Angstrom) and far-UV radiation (FUV, 912-2070
Angstrom) for the heating balance there. We use [OI] 63 micron line fluxes
observed in a sample of protoplanetary disks of the Taurus/Auriga star forming
region and compare it to the model predictions presented in our previous work.
The data were obtained with the PACS instrument on board the Herschel Space
Observatory as part of the Herschel Open Time Key Program GASPS (GAS in
Protoplanetary diskS), published in Howard et al. (2013). Our theoretical grid
of disk models can reproduce the [OI] absolute fluxes and predict a correlation
between [OI] and the sum Lx+Lfuv. The data show no correlation between the [OI]
line flux and the X-ray luminosity, the FUV luminosity or their sum. The data
show that the FUV or X-ray radiation has no notable impact on the region where
the [OI] line is formed. This is in contrast with what is predicted from our
models. Possible explanations are that the disks in Taurus are less flaring
than the hydrostatic models predict, and/or that other disk structure aspects
that were left unchanged in our models are important. ..abridged..

inconveniencing their owners. In this paper, we investigate using fairness
mechanisms to distribute power to electric vehicles on a smart grid. We assume
that during peak demand there is insufficient power to charge all the vehicles
simultaneously. In each five minute interval of time we select a subset of the
vehicles to charge, based upon information about the vehicles. We evaluate the
selection mechanisms using published data on the current demand for electric
power as a function of time of day, current driving habits for commuting, and
the current rates at which electric vehicles can be charged on home outlets. We
found that conventional selection strategies, such as first-come-first-served
or round robin, may delay a significant fraction of the vehicles by more than
two hours, even when the total available power over the course of a day is two
or three times the power required by the vehicles. However, a selection
mechanism that minimizes the maximum delay can reduce the delays to a few
minutes, even when the capacity available for charging electric vehicles
exceeds their requirements by as little as 5%.

detail how quantile regression is capable of providing an accurate estimation
of risk margin and an overview of implied capital based on the historical
volatility of a general insurers loss portfolio. Two modelling frameworks are
considered based around parametric and nonparametric quantile regression models
which we develop specifically in this insurance setting.
  In the parametric quantile regression framework, several models including the
flexible generalized beta distribution family, asymmetric Laplace (AL)
distribution and power Pareto distribution are considered under a Bayesian
regression framework. The Bayesian posterior quantile regression models in each
case are studied via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling strategies.
  In the nonparametric quantile regression framework, that we contrast to the
parametric Bayesian models, we adopted an AL distribution as a proxy and
together with the parametric AL model, we expressed the solution as a scale
mixture of uniform distributions to facilitate implementation. The models are
extended to adopt dynamic mean, variance and skewness and applied to analyze
two real loss reserve data sets to perform inference and discuss interesting
features of quantile regression for risk margin calculations.

suggest the presence of an internal ocean beneath its icy surface. The
characterization of the geophysical parameters of the icy shell and the ocean
is important to constrain the evolution models of Titan. The knowledge of the
librations, that are periodic oscillations around a uniform rotational motion,
can bring piece of information on the interior parameters. The objective of
this paper is to study the librational response in longitude from an analytical
approach for Titan composed of a deep atmosphere, an elastic icy shell, an
internal ocean, and an elastic rocky core perturbed by the gravitational
interactions with Saturn. We start from the librational equations developed for
a rigid satellite in synchronous spin-orbit resonance. We introduce explicitly
the atmospheric torque acting on the surface computed from the Titan IPSL GCM
(Institut Pierre Simon Laplace General Circulation Model) and the periodic
deformations of elastic solid layers due to the tides. We investigate the
librational response for various interior models in order to compare and to
identify the influence of the geophysical parameters and the impact of the
elasticity. The main librations arise at two well-separated forcing frequency
ranges: low forcing frequencies dominated by the Saturnian annual and
semi-annual frequencies, and a high forcing frequency regime dominated by
Titan's orbital frequency around Saturn. We find that internal structure models
including an internal ocean with elastic solid layers lead to the same order of
libration amplitude than the oceanless models, which makes more challenging to
differentiate them by the interpretation of librational motion.

this paper studies the construction of minimum-degree spanning trees. We
consider the classical node-register state model, with a weakly fair scheduler,
and we present a space-optimal \emph{silent} self-stabilizing construction of
minimum-degree spanning trees in this model. Computing a spanning tree with
minimum degree is NP-hard. Therefore, we actually focus on constructing a
spanning tree whose degree is within one from the optimal. Our algorithm uses
registers on $O(\log n)$ bits, converges in a polynomial number of rounds, and
performs polynomial-time computation at each node. Specifically, the algorithm
constructs and stabilizes on a special class of spanning trees, with degree at
most $OPT+1$. Indeed, we prove that, unless NP $=$ coNP, there are no
proof-labeling schemes involving polynomial-time computation at each node for
the whole family of spanning trees with degree at most $OPT+1$. Up to our
knowledge, this is the first example of the design of a compact silent
self-stabilizing algorithm constructing, and stabilizing on a subset of optimal
solutions to a natural problem for which there are no time-efficient
proof-labeling schemes. On our way to design our algorithm, we establish a set
of independent results that may have interest on their own. In particular, we
describe a new space-optimal silent self-stabilizing spanning tree
construction, stabilizing on \emph{any} spanning tree, in $O(n)$ rounds, and
using just \emph{one} additional bit compared to the size of the labels used to
certify trees. We also design a silent loop-free self-stabilizing algorithm for
transforming a tree into another tree. Last but not least, we provide a silent
self-stabilizing algorithm for computing and certifying the labels of a

that a small fraction of fast radio bursts (FRBs) could be associated with
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). If such FRB/GRB association systems are commonly
detected in the future, the combination of dispersion measure (DM) derived from
FRBs and redshifts derived from GRBs makes these systems a plausible tool to
conduct cosmography. We quantify uncertainties in deriving the
redshift-dependent DM_{IGM} as a function of z, and test how well dark energy
models can be constrained with Monte Carlo simulations. We show that with
potentially several 10s of FRB/GRB systems detected in a decade or so, one may
reach reasonable constraints on wCDM models. When combined with SN Ia data,
unprecedented constraints on dark energy equation of state may be achieved,
thanks to the prospects of detecting FRB/GRB systems at relatively high
redshifts. The ratio between the mean value < DM_{IGM} (z)> and luminosity
distance (D_{L} (z)) is insensitive to dark energy models. This gives the
prospects of applying SN Ia data to calibrate < DM_{IGM} (z)> using a
relatively small sample of FRB/GRB systems, allowing a reliable constraint on
the baryon inhomogeneity distribution as a function of redshift. The
methodology developed in this paper can also be applied, if the FRB redshifts
can be measured by other means. Some caveats of putting this method into
practice are also discussed.

many QSOs but remain observationally elusive. In this paper, we propose a novel
method to probe sub-parsec BBHs through microlensing of lensed QSOs. If a QSO
hosts a sub-parsec BBH in its center, it is expected that the BBH is surrounded
by a circum-binary disk, each component of the BBH is surrounded by a small
accretion disk, and a gap is opened by the secondary component in between the
circum-binary disk and the two small disks. Assuming such a BBH structure, we
generate mock microlensing light curves for some QSO systems that host BBHs
with typical physical parameters. We show that microlensing light curves of a
BBH QSO system at the infrared-optical-UV bands can be significantly different
from those of corresponding QSO system with a single massive black hole (MBH),
mainly because of the existence of the gap and the rotation of the BBH (and its
associated small disks) around the center of mass. We estimate the half-light
radii of the emission region at different wavelengths from mock light curves
and find that the obtained half-light radius vs. wavelength relations of BBH
QSO systems can be much flatter than those of single MBH QSO systems at a
wavelength range determined by the BBH parameters, such as the total mass, mass
ratio, separation, accretion rates, etc. The difference is primarily due to the
existence of the gap. Such unique features on the light curves and half-light
radius-wavelength relations of BBH QSO systems can be used to select and probe
sub-parsec BBHs in a large number of lensed QSOs to be discovered by current
and future surveys, including the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response

orbital distribution of pulsars in the vicinity of the MBH in the GC by
assuming that the pulsar progenitors, similar to the GC S-stars, were captured
to orbits tightly bound to the MBH through the tidal breakup of stellar
binaries. We use the current observations on both the GC S-stars and the
hypervelocity stars to calibrate the injection rate(s) of and the dynamical
model(s) for the stellar binaries. By including the relaxation processes,
supernova kicks, and gravitational wave radiation in our simulations, we
estimate that ~97-190 (9-14) pulsars may presently orbit the central MBH with
semimajor axes <=4000AU (<=1000AU), which is compatible with the current
observational constraints on the number of the GC pulsars. The semimajor axis
and the pericenter distance of the pulsar closest to the central MBH are
probably in the range of ~120-460AU and ~2-230AU, respectively. Future
telescopes, such as the SKA, may be able to detect a significant number of
pulsars with semimajor axis smaller than a few thousand AU in the GC. Long-term
monitoring of these pulsars would be helpful in constraining both the
environment and the metric of the central MBH. Our preferred model also results
in about ten hyperfast pulsars with velocity >~1500km/s moving away from the

configuration, the absence of thermal equilibrium admits one or more positions
of minima for the atomic potential. While the corresponding atomic potential
depths are very small for typical ground state atoms, they may become
particularly relevant for Rydberg atoms, becoming a promising tool to produce

required to evaluate all candidate services at the user - side but it is
impractical in reality. To get QoS values, the service candidates are usually
required and it is very expensive. To avoid time consuming and expensive
realworld service invocations, this paper proposes a CloudRank framework which
predicts the QoS ranking directly without predicting the corresponding QoS
values. This framework provides an accurate ranking but the QoS values are same
in both algorithms so, an optimal VM allocation policy is used to improve the
QoS performance of cloud services and it also provides better ranking accuracy

  Andrade Jr","Statistical Signs of Social Influence on Suicides","7 pages, 4 figures",,,,"stat.AP physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Certain currents in sociology consider society as being composed of
autonomous individuals with independent psychologies. Others, however, deem our
actions as strongly influenced by the accepted standards of social behavior.
The later view was central to the positivist conception of society when in 1887
\'Emile Durkheim published his monograph Suicide (Durkheim, 1897). By treating
the suicide as a social fact, Durkheim envisaged that suicide rates should be
determined by the connections (or the lack of them) between people and society.
Under the same framework, Durkheim considered that crime is bound up with the
fundamental conditions of all social life and serves a social function. In this
sense, and regardless of its extremely deviant nature, crime events are somehow
capable to release certain social tensions and so have a purging effect in
society. The social effect on the occurrence of homicides has been previously
substantiated (Bettencourt et al., 2007; Alves et al., 2013), and confirmed
here, in terms of a superlinear scaling relation: by doubling the population of
a Brazilian city results in an average increment of 135 % in the number of
homicides, rather than the expected isometric increase of 100 %, as found, for
example, for the mortality due to car crashes. Here we present statistical
signs of the social influence on the suicide occurrence in cities. Differently
from homicides (superlinear) and fatal events in car crashes (isometric), we
find sublinear scaling behavior between the number of suicides and city
population, with allometric power-law exponents, $\beta = 0.836 \pm 0.009$ and
$0.870 \pm 0.002$, for all cities in Brazil and US, respectively. The fact that
the frequency of suicides is disproportionately small for larger cities reveals
a surprisingly beneficial aspect of living and interacting in larger and more
complex social networks.

analytic distribution functions (DFs) of the form f(J), so they depend on three
integrals of motion and have triaxial velocity ellipsoids. The models, which
are generalisations of Henon's isochrone sphere, have four dimensionless
parameters, two determining the part of the DF that is even in L_z, and two
determining the odd part of the DF (which determines the azimuthal velocity
distribution). Outside their cores, the velocity ellipsoids of all models tend
to point to the model's centre, and we argue that this behaviour is generic, so
near the symmetry axis of a flattened model, the long axis of the velocity
ellipsoid is naturally aligned with the symmetry axis and not perpendicular to
it as in many published dynamical models of well-studied galaxies. By varying
one of the DF's parameters, the intensity of rotation can be increased from
zero up to a maximum value set by the requirement that the DF be non-negative.
Since angle-action coordinates are easily computed for these models, they are
ideally suited for perturbative treatments and stability analysis. They can
also be used to choose initial conditions for an N-body model that starts in
perfect equilibrium and to model observations of early-type galaxies. The
modelling technique introduced here is readily extended to different radial
density profiles, more complex kinematics, and multi-component systems. A
number of important technical issues surrounding the determination of the
models' observable properties are explained in two appendices.

  Notes",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, Moriya et al. (2013) developed an analytic bolometric light curve
model for supernovae interacting with dense circumstellar media. Because of the
dense circumstellar medium, the shocked region is assumed to be radiative and
make a thin dense shell. The model is based on the conservation of momentum in
the shocked dense shell. However, the analytic model was mentioned to neglect
the 'snow-plow' phase of the shocked dense shell by Ofek et al. (2014). The
'snow-plow' or momentum-conserving phase refers to the period in which the
momentum injection from the supernova ejecta is almost terminated and the
radiative shocked dense shell keeps moving due only to the momentum previously
provided by the supernova ejecta. In this Note, I clarify that the analytic
model of Moriya et al. (2013) does take the 'snow-plow' phase into account and
the criticism of Ofek et al. (2014) is incorrect. In addition, Ofek et al.
(2014) related the sudden luminosity break observed in the light curve of Type
IIn SN 2010jl to the transition to the 'snow-plow' phase. However, I argue that
the sudden transition to the 'snow-plow' phase is not consistent with the
luminosity break observed in SN 2010jl. The luminosity break is likely to be
related to other phenomena like the dense shell exiting the dense part of the
circumstellar medium.

molecular clouds have been detected in gamma rays. Whether these gamma rays are
generated by cosmic ray electrons or by cosmic ray protons is usually not
known. The detection of hadronic ionization signatures in spatial coincidence
with gamma ray signatures can help to unambiguously identify supernova remnants
as sources of cosmic ray protons.
  Methods: In order to calculate hadronic signatures from cosmic ray-induced
ionization for an examination of the origin of the observed gamma rays, the
transport equation for cosmic ray protons propagating in a molecular cloud,
including the relevant momentum loss processes, is solved analytically and the
proton flux at any position in the cloud is determined.
  Results: Since the solution of the transport equation is obtained for
arbitrary source functions, it can be used for a variety of supernova remnants.
The corresponding theoretical ionization rate, as a function of the penetration
depth, is derived and compared to photoinduced ionization profiles in a case
study with four supernova remnants associated with molecular clouds. Three of
the remnants show a clear dominance of the hadronically induced ionization
rate, while for one remnant, X-ray emission seems to dominate by a factor of
10.
  Conclusions: This is the first derivation of position-dependent profiles for
cosmic ray-induced ionization with an analytic solution for arbitrary cosmic
ray source spectra. The cosmic ray-induced ionization has to be compared to
X-ray ionization for strong X-ray sources. For sources dominated by cosmic
ray-induced ionization (e.g., W49B), the ionization profiles can be used in the
future to map the spatial structure of hadronic gamma rays and
rotation-vibrational lines induced by cosmic ray protons, helping to identify
sources of hadronic cosmic rays.

to short wavelength components of the roughness correlation function. We

to be consistent with the low-energy description. The proximity force
approximation is recovered in the limit of long correlation length and gives
the upper limit for the roughness correction to the Casimir force. The
renormalized low-energy theory is insensitive to the high-momentum behavior of
the roughness correlation function. Predictions of the improved theory are

polarization-entangled photon pairs from spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in
a laser-cooled $^{85}$Rb atomic ensemble, with a bandwidth (as low as 0.8 MHz)
much narrower than the rubidium atomic natural linewidth. By stabilizing the
relative phase between the two SFWM paths in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer
configuration, we are able to produce all four Bell states. These
subnatural-linewidth photon pairs with polarization entanglement are ideal
quantum information carriers for connecting remote atomic quantum nodes via
efficient light-matter interaction in a photon-atom quantum network.

  Kolla","Measuring and Understanding Throughput of Network Topologies",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High throughput is of particular interest in data center and HPC networks.
Although myriad network topologies have been proposed, a broad head-to-head
comparison across topologies and across traffic patterns is absent, and the
right way to compare worst-case throughput performance is a subtle problem.
  In this paper, we develop a framework to benchmark the throughput of network
topologies, using a two-pronged approach. First, we study performance on a
variety of synthetic and experimentally-measured traffic matrices (TMs).
Second, we show how to measure worst-case throughput by generating a
near-worst-case TM for any given topology. We apply the framework to study the
performance of these TMs in a wide range of network topologies, revealing
insights into the performance of topologies with scaling, robustness of
performance across TMs, and the effect of scattered workload placement. Our
evaluation code is freely available.

interactions. Standard model and non-standard model photon interactions along
the path between the source and the observer can lead to changes in the energy
or state of the photons, which in turn alters the observed energy spectrum of
the source. In general, these interactions are a function of photon energy as
well as source distance. Here we show how existing high energy (50 GeV --
10TeV) gamma-ray observations of blazars can be used to constrain the coupling
of axion-like-particles (ALPs) to the photon. The same ALP-photon coupling that
has been invoked to explain the observations of TeV blazars beyond their pair
production horizon is shown to have an effect of the data set of \textit{Fermi}
blazars.

constructed which are related to spatially global and time-local solutions for

constructed singularities of curvature invariants occur generically and are
accessible by g.a.p. curves. The singularities are not strongly censored, and
for strongly asymptotically predictable space-times, they are located in the
causal past of the future null infinity, and are, hence, not shielded by a
black hole. This is an alternative construction of singularities, which may be
applied to other hyperbolic equations such as the Euler equation (cf. [3] for a
different construction method- both of our constructions are fundamentally
different from supercritical blow-up constructions in the Katz-Pavlovic model
or singular solution constructions for heat-flow maps in specific dimensions).

compared to performance and area. This is due to battery life in portable
devices and operating frequency of the design. Power consumption mainly
consists of static power, dynamic power, leakage power and short circuit power.
Dynamic power is dominant among all which depends on many factors viz. power
supply, load capacitance and frequency. Switching activity also affects dynamic
power consumption of bus which is determined by calculating the number of bit
transitions on bus. The purpose of this paper is to design a bit transition
counter which can be used to calculate the switching activity of the circuit
nodes. The novel feature is that it can be inserted at any node of the circuit,
thus helpful for calculating power consumption of bus.

interact with the user in natural language. To study the cognitive processes
involved during the information search, a bottom-up methodology was adopted.
Experimentation has been set up to obtain human dialogs between a user (playing
the role of patient) dealing with medical information search and a CISMeF
expert refining the request. The analysis of these dialogs underlined the use
of discursive evidence: vocabulary, reformulation, implicit or explicit
expression of user intentions, conversational sequences, etc. A model of
artificial agent is proposed. It leads the user in its information search by
proposing to him examples, assistance and choices. This model was implemented
and integrated in the CISMeF system. ---- Cet article d\'ecrit le projet

arbitrary sensor measurements and placements. More specifically, we define the
TDOA map from the physical space of source locations to the space of range
measurements (TDOAs), in the specific case of three receivers in 2D space. We
then study the identifiability of the model, giving a complete analytical
characterization of the image of this map and its invertibility. This analysis
has been conducted in a completely mathematical fashion, using many different
tools which make it valid for every sensor configuration. These results are the
first step towards the solution of more general problems involving, for
example, a larger number of sensors, uncertainty in their placement, or lack of
synchronization.

can operate at a small terminal voltage of ~50mV, resulting in ultra-low power

and proposed a mission scenario that could allow to achieve this result. In
this work we present an updated and more complete discussion of the scientific
rationale and of the mission concept for a comparative exploration of the ice
giant planets Uranus and Neptune and of their satellite systems with twin
spacecraft. The first goal of comparatively studying these two similar yet
extremely different systems is to shed new light on the ancient past of the
Solar System and on the processes that shaped its formation and evolution.
This, in turn, would reveal whether the Solar System and the very diverse
extrasolar systems discovered so far all share a common origin or if different
environments and mechanisms were responsible for their formation. A space
mission to the ice giants would also open up the possibility to use Uranus and
Neptune as templates in the study of one of the most abundant type of
extrasolar planets in the galaxy. Finally, such a mission would allow a
detailed study of the interplanetary and gravitational environments at a range
of distances from the Sun poorly covered by direct exploration, improving the
constraints on the fundamental theories of gravitation and on the behaviour of
the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field.

physical and personal constraints of each pedestrian. Our method dynamically
changes the number of particles allocated to each pedestrian based on different

dataset, which is used to evaluate the performance of different pedestrian
tracking algorithms. This dataset consists of videos of indoor and outdoor
scenes, recorded at different locations with 30-80 pedestrians. We highlight
the performance benefits of our algorithm over prior techniques using this

pedestrians on a multi-core desktop CPU at interactive rates (27-30 frames per
second). To the best of our knowledge, our approach is 4-5 times faster than
prior methods, which provide similar accuracy.

communicate with one another using multihop wireless links. MANETs are often
deployed in the environments, where there is no fixed infrastructure and
centralized management. The nodes of mobile ad hoc networks are susceptible to
compromise. In such a scenario, designing an efficient, reliable and secure
routing protocol has been a major challengesue over the last many years. The
routing protocol Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) has no security
measures in-built in it. It is vulnerable to many types of routing attacks. The
flood attack is one of them. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective
technique to secure Ad hoc Ondemand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol
against flood attacks. To deal with a flood attack, we have proposed Neighbor
Defense Technique for Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (NDTAODV). This makes
AODV more robust. The proposed technique has been designed to isolate the flood
attacker with the use of timers, peak value and hello alarm technique. We have
simulated our work in Network Simulator NS-2.33 (NS-2) with different pause
times by way of different number of malicious nodes. We have compared the
performance of NDTAODV with the AODV in normal situation as well as in the
presence of malicious attacks. We have considered Packet Delivery Fraction
(PDF), Average Throughput (AT) and Normalized Routing Load (NRL) for comparing
the performance of NDTAODV and AODV.
