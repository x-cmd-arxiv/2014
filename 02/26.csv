constraint. The kinetic constraint results in clustering of immobile vehicles;
these clusters can grow to macroscopic condensates, indicating the onset of
dynamic phase separation between free flowing and arrested traffic. We
investigate analytically the conditions under which this occurs, and derive a
necessary and sufficient criterion for phase separation. This criterion is
applied to the well-known Nagel-Schreckenberg model of traffic flow to
analytically investigate the existence of dynamic condensates. We find that
true condensates occur only when acceleration out of jammed traffic happens in
a single time step, in the limit of strong overbraking. Our predictions are
further verified with simulation results on the growth of arrested clusters.
These results provide analytic understanding of dynamic arrest and dynamic
phase separation in one-dimensional traffic and transport models.

ever achieved the same degree of complexity. That failure seemed easy to
rationalise: the larger the number of distinct building blocks, the higher the

with attractive patches, the interaction strengths of which are computed using
a standard thermodynamic model. We find that, within a narrow temperature
window, the target structure assembles with high probability. Our simulations
suggest that mis-assembly is disfavoured because of a slow nucleation step. As
our model incorporates no aspect of DNA other than its binding properties,
these simulations suggest that, with proper design of the building blocks,
other systems, such as colloids, may also assemble into truly complex

crossover from the Heisenberg-type criticality to the much stronger Ising-type

parallel to the spin diffusion mechanism. Whereas the latter is sensitive to

boundary conditions is analyzed. The system of strongly coupled parabolic
equations for particle density and spin density vector describes the
spin-polarized semi-classical electron transport in ferromagnetic
semiconductors. The presence of a nonconstant and nonsmooth magnetization
vector, solution of the Landau-Lifshitz equation, causes the diffusion matrix
to be dependent from space and time and to have in general poor regularity
properties, thus making the analysis challenging. To partially overcome the
analytical difficulties the velocity saturation hypothesis is made, which
results in a bounded drift velocity. The global-in-time existence and
uniqueness of weak solutions is shown by means of a semi-discretization in
time, which yields an elliptic semilinear problem, and a quadratic entropy
inequality, which allow for the limit of vanishing time step size. The
convergence of the weak solutions to the steady state, under some restrictions
on the parameters and data, is shown. Finally the higher regularity of
solutions for a smooth magnetization in two space dimensions is shown through a
diagonalization argument, which allows to get rid of the cross diffusion terms
in the fluid equations, and the iterative application of Gagliardo-Nirenberg
inequalities and a generalized version of Aubin lemma.

of an astrophysical background is identical to that of an idealised background.
However, any one realisation of an astrophysical background can produce a
different signature. Using a model consisting of an ensemble of binary neutron
star coalescences, we quantify the typical difference between the signal from
individual realisations of the astrophysical background and the idealised case.
For advanced detectors, we find that, using a cross-correlation analysis,
astrophysical backgrounds from many discrete sources are probably
indistinguishable from an idealised background.

about each other. The distance between the two molecular ends, on either side

induces the braiding. In a model, developed for understanding such a system, we
assume that each molecule can be divided into a braided and unbraided section.
We also suppose that the DNA is nicked so that there is no constraint of the
individual linking numbers of the molecules. Included in the model are steric
and electrostatic interactions, thermal fluctuations of the braided and
unbraided sections of the molecule, as well as the constraint on the braid
linking (catenation) number. We compare two approximations used in estimating
the free energy of the braided section. One is where the amplitude of
undulations of one molecule with respect to the other is determined only by
steric interactions. The other is a self-consistent determination of the mean
squared amplitude of these undulations. In this second approximation
electrostatics should play an important role in determining this quantity, as
suggested by physical arguments. We see that if the electrostatic interaction
is sufficiently large there are indeed notable differences between the two
approximations. We go on to test the self-consistent approximation, included in
the full model, against experimental data, for such a system, and we find good
agreement. However, there seems to by a slight left/right handed braid
asymmetry in some of the experimental results. We discuss what might be the

boson mass, the measurement of $W$ and $Z$ charge asymmetry. These measurements
provide precision tests on the electroweak theory, high order predictions and
the information can be used to constraint parton distribution functions.

$\overline{B}^0$ meson is updated using data corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 3.0 fb$^{-1}$ collected using 7 and 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy
$pp$ collisions at the LHC. The decay modes used are $\overline{B}^0\to J/\psi
p K^-$ and $\overline{B}^0\to J/\psi \pi^+ K^-$, where the $\pi^+K^-$ mass is
consistent with that of the $\overline{K}^{*0}(892)$ meson. The lifetime ratio
is determined with unprecedented precision to be $0.974\pm0.006\pm0.004$, where
the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. This result is
in agreement with original theoretical predictions based on the heavy quark
expansion. Using the current world average of the $\overline{B}^0$ lifetime,
the $\Lambda^0_b$ lifetime is found to be $1.479 \pm 0.009 \pm 0.010$ ps.

decisions based cooperative spectrum sensing is well known for its mathematical
intractability. Previous work relied on simple suboptimal counting rules for
decision fusion in order to avoid the exhaustive numerical search required for
obtaining the optimal thresholds. However, these simple rules are not globally
optimal as they do not maximize the overall global detection probability by
jointly selecting local and global thresholds. Instead, they maximize the
detection probability for a specific global threshold. In this paper, a
globally optimal decision fusion rule for Primary User signal detection based
on the Neyman- Pearson (NP) criterion is derived. The algorithm is based on a
novel representation for the global performance metrics in terms of the
regularized incomplete beta function. Based on this mathematical
representation, it is shown that the globally optimal NP hard decision fusion
test can be put in the form of a conventional one dimensional convex
optimization problem. A binary search for the global threshold can be applied
yielding a complexity of O(log2(N)), where N represents the number of
cooperating users. The logarithmic complexity is appreciated because we are
concerned with dense networks, and thus N is expected to be large. The proposed
optimal scheme outperforms conventional counting rules, such as the OR, AND,
and MAJORITY rules. It is shown via simulations that, although the optimal rule
tends to the simple OR rule when the number of cooperating secondary users is
small, it offers significant SNR gain in dense cognitive radio networks with
large number of cooperating users.

relativity simulations and the analytical effective-one-body (EOB) model. The
EOB model predicts quasiuniversal relations between the mass-rescaled
gravitational wave frequency and the binding energy at the moment of merger,
and certain dimensionless binary tidal coupling constants depending on the
stars Love numbers, compactnesses and the binary mass ratio. These relations
are quasiuniversal in the sense that, for a given value of the tidal coupling
constant, they depend significantly neither on the equation of state nor on the
mass ratio, though they do depend on stars spins. The spin dependence is
approximately linear for small spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum.
The quasiuniversality is a property of the conservative dynamics; nontrivial
relations emerge as the binary interaction becomes tidally dominated. This
analytical prediction is qualitatively consistent with new, multi-orbit
numerical relativity results for the relevant case of equal-mass irrotational
binaries. Universal relations are thus expected to characterize neutron star
mergers dynamics. In the context of gravitational wave astronomy, these
universal relations may be used to constrain the neutron star equation of state
using waveforms that model the merger accurately.

alternative model including these states and a non-resonant $J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$

transversity components measured for the spin-2 intermediate states, the final

not observed, allowing a limit to be set on the absolute value of the mixing

transmitter is proposed to drive Superconducting RF (SRF) cavities for
intensity-frontier GeV-scale proton/ion linacs. The transmitter performance at
the dynamic control was verified in experiments with CW, S-Band, 1 kW
magnetrons. The wideband control of magnetrons, required for the
superconducting linacs, was realized using the magnetrons, injection-locked by
the phase-modulated signals. The capabilities of the magnetrons
injection-locked by the phase-modulated signals and adequateness for feeding of
SRF cavities were verified by measurements of the transfer function magnitude
characteristics of single and 2-cascade magnetrons, by measurements the
magnetrons phase performance and by measurements of spectra of the carrier
frequency. At the ratio of power of locking signal to output power less than
-13 dB (in 2-cascade scheme per magnetron, respectively) we demonstrated a
phase modulation bandwidth of over 1.0 MHz. The carrier frequency spectrum
width about of 1 Hz at the level less than -60 dBc did not demonstrate
broadening at wide range of magnitude and frequency of the phase modulation of
the injection-locking signal. The wideband dynamic control of output power of
the transmitter model was first experimentally demonstrated using two
magnetrons, combined in power and injection-locked by the phase-modulated
signals. The experiments with the injection-locked magnetrons adequately
emulated the wideband dynamic control with a feedback control system, which
will allow suppressing all known parasitic modulation of the accelerating field
in the SRF cavities. The magnetron transmitter concept, tests of the setups and
injection-locking of magnetrons by phase-modulated signals are discussed in
this work.

selection of a prior density. In some cases, Bayesian inference remains fairly
stable under a large range of noninformative prior distributions. However, as
discussed by \citet{Hd}, there may also be unintended consequences of a choice
of a noninformative prior and, these authors consider this problem ignored in
Bayesian studies. As they based their argumentation on four examples, we
reassess these examples and their Bayesian processing via different prior
choices. Our conclusion is to lower the degree of worry about the impact of the
prior, exhibiting an overall stability of the posterior distributions. We thus
consider that the warnings of Seaman et al. (2012), while commendable, do not
jeopardize the use of most noninformative priors.

Their structural, magnetic and superconducting properties have been determined
with in-situ reflection high energy electron diffraction, x-ray diffraction,
specular neutron reflectometry, scanning transmission electron microscopy,
electric transport, and magnetization measurements. We find that despite the
large mismatch between the in-plane lattice parameters of LSCO and LCMO these
superlattices can be grown epitaxially and with a high crystalline quality.
While the first LSCO layer remains clamped to the LSAO substrate, a sizeable
strain relaxation occurs already in the first LCMO layer. The following LSCO
and LCMO layers adopt a nearly balanced state in which the tensile and
compressive strain effects yield alternating in-plane lattice parameters with
an almost constant average value. No major defects are observed in the LSCO
layers, while a significant number of vertical antiphase boundaries are found
in the LCMO layers. The LSCO layers remain superconducting with a relatively
high superconducting onset temperature of about 36 K. The macroscopic
superconducting response is also evident in the magnetization data due to a
weak diamagnetic signal below 10 K for H || ab and a sizeable paramagnetic
shift for H || c that can be explained in terms of a vortex-pinning-induced
flux compression. The LCMO layers maintain a strongly ferromagnetic state with
a Curie temperature of about 190 K and a large low-temperature saturation
moment of about 3.5(1) muB. These results suggest that the LSCO/LCMO
superlattices can be used to study the interaction between the antagonistic
ferromagnetic and superconducting orders and, in combination with previous
studies on YBCO/LCMO superlattices, may allow one to identify the relevant
mechanisms.

  with Application to the Missing Mass",,,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we are concerned with obtaining distribution-free
concentration inequalities for mixture of independent Bernoulli variables that
incorporate a notion of variance. Missing mass is the total probability mass
associated to the outcomes that have not been seen in a given sample which is
an important quantity that connects density estimates obtained from a sample to
the population for discrete distributions. Therefore, we are specifically
motivated to apply our method to study the concentration of missing mass -
which can be expressed as a mixture of Bernoulli - in a novel way.
  We not only derive - for the first time - Bernstein-like large deviation
bounds for the missing mass whose exponents behave almost linearly with respect
to deviation size, but also sharpen McAllester and Ortiz (2003) and Berend and
Kontorovich (2013) for large sample sizes in the case of small deviations which
is the most interesting case in learning theory. In the meantime, our approach
shows that the heterogeneity issue introduced in McAllester and Ortiz (2003) is
resolvable in the case of missing mass in the sense that one can use standard
inequalities but it may not lead to strong results. Thus, we postulate that our
results are general and can be applied to provide potentially sharp
Bernstein-like bounds under some constraints.

alternative quantum-chemical approaches oriented towards revival of the
classical tradition of qualitative chemical thinking instead of obtaining
numerical results. The above-mentioned tradition is concluded to be based
mainly on principles (rules) of additivity, transferability and locality of
molecular properties. Accordingly, model Hamiltonian matrices are used in the
approaches under development (called quasi-classical alternatives), wherein
algebraic parameters play the role of matrix elements and these are assumed to
be transferable for similar atoms and/or atomic orbitals in addition. Further,
passing to delocalized descriptions of electronic structures (as usual) is
expected to be the main origin of difficulties seeking to formulate
quasi-classical alternatives. In the framework of the canonical method of
molecular orbitals (MOs), delocalization is shown to be partially avoidable by
invoking a recently-suggested approach to secular (eigenvalue) equations for
model Hamiltonian matrices, wherein the usual initial imposing of the
zero-determinant condition is replaced by a certain reformulation of the
problem itself. The most efficient way of achieving the same end, however, is
shown to consist in passing to non-canonical one-electron problems. The latter
may be exemplified by the block-diagonalization problem for the relevant
Hamiltonian matrix following from the Brillouin theorem and yielding
non-canonical (localized) MOs and by the commutation equation for the
respective one-electron density matrix (charge- bond order matrix). In this
connection, most of attention is paid in the article to perturbative solutions
of the above-mentioned non-canonical problems and to their implications,
including common quantum-chemical descriptions of entire classes of chemical
compounds.

negative mass instability (NMI) reported recently by Dodin et al [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 110, 215006 (2013)]. Due to the NMI, trapped electrons form
macroparticles that produce field oscillations at harmonics of the bounce
frequency. At large enough amplitudes, these harmonics can phase-lock to the
main wave and form stable nonlinear dissipationless structures that are
nonstationary but otherwise similar to Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal modes. The
theory explains why the formation of KEEN modes is sensitive to the excitation
scenario and yields estimates that agree with the numerical results of Afeyan

we consider this problem for variations of the deterministic Linear Threshold

we consider both sequential and simultaneous dynamics when deactivations are

deactivations allowed is significantly harder than all others. In contrast,
sequential dynamics make the problem trivial on cliques even though it's

differentially private algorithms. Differential privacy is a strong and
well-studied notion of privacy introduced by Dwork et al. (2006) that ensures
that the output of an algorithm leaks little information about the data point
provided by any of the participating individuals. Sample complexity of private
PAC and agnostic learning was studied in a number of prior works starting with
(Kasiviswanathan et al., 2008) but a number of basic questions still remain
open, most notably whether learning with privacy requires more samples than
learning without privacy.
  We show that the sample complexity of learning with (pure) differential
privacy can be arbitrarily higher than the sample complexity of learning
without the privacy constraint or the sample complexity of learning with
approximate differential privacy. Our second contribution and the main tool is
an equivalence between the sample complexity of (pure) differentially private
learning of a concept class $C$ (or $SCDP(C)$) and the randomized one-way
communication complexity of the evaluation problem for concepts from $C$. Using
this equivalence we prove the following bounds:
  1. $SCDP(C) = \Omega(LDim(C))$, where $LDim(C)$ is the Littlestone's (1987)
dimension characterizing the number of mistakes in the online-mistake-bound
learning model. Known bounds on $LDim(C)$ then imply that $SCDP(C)$ can be much
higher than the VC-dimension of $C$.
  2. For any $t$, there exists a class $C$ such that $LDim(C)=2$ but $SCDP(C)
\geq t$.
  3. For any $t$, there exists a class $C$ such that the sample complexity of
(pure) $\alpha$-differentially private PAC learning is $\Omega(t/\alpha)$ but
the sample complexity of the relaxed $(\alpha,\beta)$-differentially private
PAC learning is $O(\log(1/\beta)/\alpha)$. This resolves an open problem of
Beimel et al. (2013b).

systems with internal moves, namely: weak bisimulation and trace semantics.
  We continue our research on weak bisimulations for coalgebras over order
enriched monads. The key notions used in this paper and proposed by us in our
previous work are the notions of an order saturation monad and a saturator. A
saturator operator can be intuitively understood as a reflexive, transitive
closure operator. There are two approaches towards defining saturators for
coalgebras with internal moves. Here, we give necessary conditions for them to
yield the same notion of weak bisimulation.
  Finally, we propose a definition of trace semantics for coalgebras with
silent moves via a uniform fixed point operator. We compare strong and weak
bisimilation together with trace semantics for coalgebras with internal steps.

gravitational effects of quantum fields upon light propagation. Our model uses
a nonlinear material with a nonzero third order polarizability. Here a probe
light pulse satisfies a wave equation containing the expectation value of the
squared electric field. This expectation value depends upon the presence of
lower frequency quanta, the background field, and modifies the effective index
of refraction, and hence the speed of the probe pulse. If the mean squared
electric field is positive, then the pulse is slowed, which is analogous to the
gravitational effects of ordinary matter. Such matter satisfies the null energy
condition and produce gravitational lensing and time delay. If the mean squared
field is negative, then the pulse has a higher speed than in the absence of the
background field. This is analogous to the gravitational effects of exotic
matter, such as stress tensor expectation values with locally negative energy
densities, which lead to repulsive gravitational effects, such as defocussing
and time advance. We give some estimates of the magnitude of the effects in our
model, and find that they may be large enough to be observable. We also briefly
discuss the possibility that the mean squared electric field could be produced
by the Casimir vacuum near a reflecting boundary.

groups are in the special orthogonal, or symplectic, groups. This self-adjoint

possible formation of a neutron star. Although this compact object has eluded
all observations, theoretical and numerical developments have allowed a glimpse
of the fate of it. In particular, a hypercritical accretion model has been
proposed to forecast the accretion of $\sim 0.15 \:\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ in two
hours and the subsequent submergence of the magnetic field in the newborn
neutron star. In this paper, we revisit the Chevalier's model in a numerical
framework, focusing on the neutrino cooling effect on the supernova fall-back
dynamics. For that, using a customized version of the FLASH code, we carry out
numerical simulations of the accretion of matter onto the newborn neutron star
in order to estimate the size of the neutrino-sphere, the emissivity and
luminosity of neutrinos. As a signature of this phase, we estimate the
neutrinos expected on SK neutrino experiment and their flavor ratios. This is
academically important because, although currently it was very difficult to
detect 1.46 thermal neutrinos and their oscillations, these fingerprints are
the only viable and reliable way to confirm the hypercritical phase. Perhaps
new techniques for detecting neutrino oscillations arise in the near future
allowing us to confirm our estimates.

  Three-Dimensional Maxwell's Equations for Complex Media",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article focuses on solving the generalized eigenvalue problems (GEP)
arising in the source-free Maxwell equation with magnetoelectric coupling
effects that models three-dimensional complex media. The goal is to compute the
smallest positive eigenvalues, and the main challenge is that the coefficient
matrix in the discrete Maxwell equation is indefinite and degenerate. To
overcome this difficulty, we derive a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the
discrete single-curl operator and then explicitly express the basis of the
invariant subspace corresponding to the nonzero eigenvalues of the GEP.
Consequently, we reduce the GEP to a null space free standard eigenvalue
problem (NFSEP) that contains only the nonzero (complex) eigenvalues of the GEP
and can be solved by the shift-and-invert Arnoldi method without being
disturbed by the null space. Furthermore, the basis of the eigendecomposition
is chosen carefully so that we can apply fast Fourier transformation
(FFT)-based matrix vector multiplication to solve the embedded linear systems
efficiently by an iterative method. For chiral and pseudochiral complex media,
which are of great interest in magnetoelectric applications, the NFSEP can be
further transformed to a null space free generalized eigenvalue problem whose
coefficient matrices are Hermitian and Hermitian positive definite
(HHPD-NFGEP). This HHPD-NFGEP can be solved by using the invert Lanczos method
without shifting. Furthermore, the embedded linear system can be solved
efficiently by using the conjugate gradient method without preconditioning and
the FFT-based matrix vector multiplications. Numerical results are presented to
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

interesting consequences in the context of the recent debate on the reality of

large-scale processes that affect the evolutionary history of groups of
co-distributed populations of organisms. Such events predict temporally
clustered divergences times, a pattern that can be estimated using genetic data
from co-distributed species. I introduce a new approximate-Bayesian method for
comparative phylogeographical model-choice that estimates the temporal
distribution of divergences across taxa from multi-locus DNA sequence data. The
model is an extension of that implemented in msBayes. By reparameterizing the
model, introducing more flexible priors on demographic and divergence-time
parameters, and implementing a non-parametric Dirichlet-process prior over
divergence models, I improved the robustness, accuracy, and power of the method
for estimating shared evolutionary history across taxa. The results demonstrate
the improved performance of the new method is due to (1) more appropriate
priors on divergence-time and demographic parameters that avoid prohibitively
small marginal likelihoods for models with more divergence events, and (2) the
Dirichlet-process providing a flexible prior on divergence histories that does
not strongly disfavor models with intermediate numbers of divergence events.
The new method yields more robust estimates of posterior uncertainty, and thus
greatly reduces the tendency to incorrectly estimate models of shared
evolutionary history with strong support.

stationary memoryless sources on countably infinite alphabets. This task is
generally not achievable without restricting the class of sources over which
universality is desired. Building on our prior work, we propose natural
families of sources characterized by a common dominating envelope. We
particularly emphasize the notion of adaptivity, which is the ability to
perform as well as an oracle knowing the envelope, without actually knowing it.
This is closely related to the notion of hierarchical universal source coding,
but with the important difference that families of envelope classes are not
discretely indexed and not necessarily nested.
  Our contribution is to extend the classes of envelopes over which adaptive
universal source coding is possible, namely by including max-stable
(heavy-tailed) envelopes which are excellent models in many applications, such
as natural language modeling. We derive a minimax lower bound on the redundancy
of any code on such envelope classes, including an oracle that knows the
envelope. We then propose a constructive code that does not use knowledge of
the envelope. The code is computationally efficient and is structured to use an
{E}xpanding {T}hreshold for {A}uto-{C}ensoring, and we therefore dub it the
\textsc{ETAC}-code. We prove that the \textsc{ETAC}-code achieves the lower
bound on the minimax redundancy within a factor logarithmic in the sequence
length, and can be therefore qualified as a near-adaptive code over families of
heavy-tailed envelopes. For finite and light-tailed envelopes the penalty is
even less, and the same code follows closely previous results that explicitly
made the light-tailed assumption. Our technical results are founded on methods
from regular variation theory and concentration of measure.

strengths of global optimization with the unbiased/athermal sampling of nested

range, at 24 $\mu$m, $13.6 \pm 2.8 \%$ of the stars younger than 5 Gyr have

$4.7^{+3.7}_{-2.2}$% of the older stars do. To characterize the far infrared
behavior of debris disks more robustly, we double the sample by including stars
from the DEBRIS and DUNES surveys. For the F4 - K4 stars in this combined
sample, there is only a weak (statistically not significant) trend in the
incidence of far infrared excess with spectral type (detected fractions of
21.9$^{+4.8}_{-4.3}\%$, late F; 16.5$^{+3.9}_{-3.3}\%$, G; and
16.9$^{+6.3}_{-5.0}\%$, early K). Taking this spectral type range together,
there is a significant decline between 3 and 4.5 Gyr in the incidence of
excesses with fractional luminosities just under $10^{-5}$. There is an
indication that the timescale for decay of infrared excesses varies roughly
inversely with the fractional luminosity. This behavior is consistent with
theoretical expectations for passive evolution. However, more excesses are
detected around the oldest stars than is expected from passive evolution,
suggesting that there is late-phase dynamical activity around these stars.

(S$^4$G), a recently calibrated empirical stellar mass estimator from Eskew et
al., and an extensive database of HI spectral line profiles to examine the
baryonic Tully-Fisher (BTF) relation. We find 1) that the BTF has lower scatter
than the classic Tully-Fisher (TF) relation and is better described as a linear
relationship, confirming similar previous results, 2) that the inclusion of a
radial scale in the BTF decreases the scatter but only modestly, as seen
previously for the TF relation, and 3) that the slope of the BTF, which we find
to be $3.5\pm 0.2$ ($\Delta$ log $M_{baryon}/\Delta$ log $v_c$), implies that
on average a nearly constant fraction ($\sim 0.4$) of all baryons expected to
be in a halo are ""condensed"" onto the central region of rotationally supported
galaxies. The condensed baryon fraction, $M_{baryon}/M_{total}$, is, to our
measurement precision, nearly independent of galaxy circular velocity (our
sample spans circular velocities, $v_c$, between 60 and 250 km s$^{-1}$, but is
extended to $v_c\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ using data from the literature). The
observed galaxy-to-galaxy scatter in this fraction is generally $\le$ a factor
of 2 despite fairly liberal selection criteria. These results imply that
cooling and heating processes, such as cold vs. hot accretion, mass loss due to
stellar winds, and AGN driven feedback, to the degree that they affect the
global galactic properties involved in the BTF, are independent of halo mass
for galaxies with $10 < v_c < 250$ km/s and typically introduce no more than a
factor of two range in the resulting $M_{baryon}/M_{total}$. Recent simulations
by Aumer et al. of a small sample of disk galaxies are in excellent agreement
with our data, suggesting that current simulations are capable of reproducing
the global properties of individual disk galaxies.

  global surface temperature and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation respectively",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding current global climate requires an understanding of trends both
in Earth's atmospheric temperature and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO),
a characteristic large-scale distribution of warm water in the tropical Pacific
Ocean and the dominant mode of year-to-year climate variability (Holbrook et
al. 2009. However, despite much effort, the average projection of current
climate models has become statistically significantly different from the
observed 21st century global surface temperature trend (Fyfe 2013)and has
failed to reflect the statistically significant evidence that annual-mean
global temperature has not risen in the 21st century (Fyfe 2013, Kosaka 2013).
Modelling also provides a wide range of predictions for future ENSO
variability, some showing an increase, others a decrease and some no change
(Guilyardi, et al. 2012; Bellenger, 2013). Here we present correlations which
include the current era and do not have these drawbacks. The correlations arise
as follows. First it has been shown (Kuo 1990, Wang W. et al. 2013) that the
rate of change of the level of atmospheric CO2 (expressed as its first
derivative) has a time-trend signature which is statistically significantly
similar to that for global surface temperature. Second, we show here that the
rate of this change - the second derivative of the level of atmospheric CO2 -
is statistically significantly correlated with the separate signature displayed
by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Third, we show that second-derivative
atmospheric CO2 leads ENSO, first-derivative CO2 and temperature. Taken
together the foregoing three points provide further lines of evidence for the
key role of atmospheric CO2 as a driver of global climate. The results may also
contribute to more accurate prediction of future global climate.

global scale transformations. We show that this anomaly cannot be reproduced if
$T$ is a generalized free field unless the theory also contains a dimension-2
scalar operator. In the special case where such an operator is present it can
be used to redefine (""improve"") the energy-momentum tensor, and we show that
there is at least one energy-momentum tensor that is not a generalized free

correlation functions cannot be understood from the leading terms of the
coordinate space OPE. This invalidates a recent argument by
Farnsworth-Luty-Prilepina (FLP). Despite the invalidity of the general argument
of FLP, some of the techniques turn out to be useful in the present context.

on the dust in and interior to infalling shells of cold gas can greatly impact
the amount of gas able to be accreted and therefore the frequency of AGN
bursts. However, the overall hydrodynamic evolution of all models, including
mass budget, is relatively robust to the assumptions on dust. We find that IR
re-emission from hot dust can dominate the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy
during the early stages of an AGN burst, reaching values in excess of $10^{46}$
erg/s. The AGN-emitted UV is largely absorbed, but the optical depth in the IR

cycle, broadband luminosities, dust mass, black hole mass, and other model
predictions to current observations. These constraints force us to models

stars in our sample, we are able to follow the alpha-element evolution from
[Fe/H]=-2.5 continuously to [Fe/H]=-0.7 dex. For the first time we are able to
resolve the turnover from the Type II supernovae (SNe) dominated,
alpha-enhanced plateau down to subsolar [alpha/Fe] values due to the onset of
SNe Ia, and thus to trace the chemical enrichment efficiency of the galaxy. Our
data support the general concept of an alpha-enhanced plateau at early epochs,
followed by a well-defined ""knee"", caused by the onset of SNe Ia, and finally a
second plateau with sub-solar [alpha/Fe] values. We find the position of this
knee to be at [Fe/H]=-1.9 and therefore significantly more metal-poor than
expected from comparison with other dSphs and standard evolutionary models.
Surprisingly, this value is rather comparable to the knee in Sculptor, a dSph
about 10 times less luminous than Fornax. Using chemical evolution models, we
find that both the position of the knee as well as the subsequent plateau at
sub-solar level can hardly be explained unless the galaxy experienced several
discrete star formation events with a drastic variation in star formation
efficiency, while a uniform star formation can be ruled out. One possible
evolutionary scenario is that Fornax experienced one or several major accretion
events from gas-rich systems in the past, so that its current stellar mass is
not indicative of the chemical evolution environment at ancient times. If
Fornax is the product of several smaller building blocks, this may also have
implications of the understanding on the formation process of dSphs in general.

sequence (MS) open clusters, and explore the origin of the Li dispersion in
young, cool stars of equal mass, age and composition. We first demonstrate that
SSMs accurately predict the Li abundances of solar analogs at the zero-age main
sequence (ZAMS) within theoretical uncertainties. We then measure the rate of
MS Li depletion by removing the [Fe/H]-dependent ZAMS Li pattern from three
well-studied clusters, and comparing the detrended data. MS depletion is found
to be mass dependent, in the sense of more depletion at low mass. A dispersion
in Li abundance at fixed $T_{\rm eff}$ is nearly universal, and sets in by
$\sim$200 Myr. We discuss mass and age dispersion trends, and the pattern is
mixed. We argue that metallicity impacts the ZAMS Li pattern, in agreement with
theoretical expectations but contrary to the findings of some previous studies,
and suggest Li as a test of cluster metallicity. Finally, we argue that a
radius dispersion in stars of fixed mass and age, during the epoch of pre-MS Li
destruction, is responsible for the spread in Li abundances and the correlation
between rotation and Li in young cool stars, most well known in the Pleiades.
We calculate stellar models, inflated to match observed radius anomalies in
magnetically active systems, and the resulting range of Li abundances
reproduces the observed patterns of young clusters. We discuss ramifications
for pre-MS evolutionary tracks and age measurements of young clusters, and
suggest an observational test.

the presence of a galaxy, or group of galaxies, with a total luminosity of
$L_{\rm IR}\approx10^{12}L_\odot$. The position of an active source at the
center of a ~50kpc-radius ring of linearly polarized Ly-alpha emission detected
by Hayes et al. (2011) suggests that the central source is leaking Ly-alpha
photons preferentially in the plane of the sky, which undergo scattering in HI
clouds at large galactocentric radius. The Ly-alpha morphology around the
submillimeter detection is reminiscent of biconical outflow, and the average
Ly-alpha line profiles of the two `lobes' are dominated by a red peak, expected
for a resonant line emerging from a medium with a bulk velocity gradient that
is outflowing relative to the line center. Taken together, these observations
provide compelling evidence that the central active galaxy (or galaxies) is
responsible for a large fraction of the extended Ly-alpha emission and
morphology. Less clear is the history of the cold gas in the circumgalactic
medium being traced by Ly-alpha: is it mainly pristine material accreting into
the halo that has not yet been processed through an interstellar medium (ISM),
now being blown back as it encounters an outflow, or does it mainly comprise
gas that has been swept-up within the ISM and expelled from the galaxy?

while supernovae are generally characterized by non-relativistic ejecta. GRB
afterglows decelerate rapidly usually within days, because their low-mass
ejecta rapidly sweep up a comparatively larger mass of circumstellar material.
However supernovae, with heavy ejecta, can be in nearly free expansion for
centuries. Supernovae were thought to have non-relativistic outflows except for
few relativistic ones accompanied by GRBs. This clear division was blurred by
SN 2009bb, the first supernova with a relativistic outflow without an observed
GRB. Yet the ejecta from SN 2009bb was baryon loaded, and in nearly-free
expansion for a year, unlike GRBs. We report the first supernova discovered
without a GRB, but with rapidly decelerating mildly relativistic ejecta, SN
2012ap. We discovered a bright and rapidly evolving radio counterpart driven by
the circumstellar interaction of the relativistic ejecta. However, we did not

off-axis that become visible on timescales of days/years at optical/NIR and
radio frequencies, when the prompt emission at high energies (X and gamma rays)
has already ceased. Given the typically estimated jet opening angle of GRBs
theta_jet ~ 3 deg, for each burst pointing to the Earth there should be a
factor ~ 700 more GRBs pointing in other directions. Despite this, no secure
OAs have been detected so far. Through a population synthesis code we study the
emission properties of the population of OA at radio frequencies. OAs reach
their emission peak on year-timescales and they last for a comparable amount of
time. The typical peak fluxes (which depend on the observing frequency) are of
few micro Jy in the radio band with only a few OA reaching the mJy level. These
values are consistent with the upper limits on the radio flux of SN Ib/c
observed at late times. We find that the OA radio number count distribution has
a typical slope -1.7 at high fluxes and a flatter (-0.4) slope at low fluxes
with a break at a frequency-dependent flux. Our predictions of the OA rates are
consistent with the (upper) limits of recent radio surveys and archive searches
for radio transients. Future radio surveys like VAST/ASKAP at 1.4 GHz should
detect ~ 3x10^-3 OA deg^-2 yr-1, MeerKAT and EVLA at 8.4 GHz should see ~
3x10^-1 OA deg-2 yr-1. The SKA, reaching the micro Jy flux limit, could see up
to ~ 0.2-1.5 OA deg^-2 yr^-1. These rates also depend on the duration of the OA
above a certain flux limit and we discuss this effect with respect to the
survey cadence.

spectroscopic study of the FUV radiation fields of 16 T Tauri stars whose dust
disks display a range of evolutionary states. We include reconstructed
Ly$\alpha$ line profiles and remove atomic and molecular disk emission (from
H$_{2}$ and CO fluorescence) to provide robust measurements of both the FUV
continuum and hot gas lines (e.g., Ly$\alpha$, \ion{N}{5}, \ion{C}{4},
\ion{He}{2}) for an appreciable sample of T Tauri stars for the first time. We
find that the flux of the typical Classical T Tauri Star FUV radiation field at

the total FUV flux, with the FUV continuum accounting for an average of 8%.
Both the FUV continuum and Ly$\alpha$ flux are strongly correlated with
\ion{C}{4} flux, suggesting that accretion processes dominate the production of
both of these components. On average, only $\sim$ 0.5% of the total FUV flux is

these orbits produce periodic quantum oscillations of the density of states in
a magnetic field, enabling a variety of experimental probes of the
unconventional Fermi-arc surface states. The orbits are also essential for
reproducing the bulk chiral anomaly in a finite slab. These results are then
extended to the closely related and recently discovered 3D Dirac SM materials,
including Cd3As2 and Na3Bi, which are doubled copies of Weyl semi-metals
protected by crystal symmetry. Despite the fact that the protecting crystal
symmetry is broken by a surface, we show that Dirac materials can still host

core-collapse supernovae, proto-neutron stars, and neutron star mergers.
Numerical results of the state variables are compared with those of a typical
Skyrme energy density functional with similar properties at nuclear densities,
but which differs substantially at supra-nuclear densities. Analytical
formulas, which are applicable to non-relativistic potential models such as the
equations of state we are considering, are derived for all state variables and
their thermodynamic derivatives. A highlight of our work is its focus on
thermal response functions in the degenerate and non-degenerate situations,
which allow checks of the numerical calculations for arbitrary degeneracy.
These functions are sensitive to the density dependent effective masses of
neutrons and protons, which determine the thermal properties in all regimes of
degeneracy. We develop the ""thermal asymmetry free energy"" and establish its
relation to the more commonly used nuclear symmetry energy. We also explore the
role of the pion condensate at supra-nuclear densities and temperatures. Tables
of matter properties as functions of baryon density, composition (i.e., proton
fraction) and temperature are being produced which are suitable for use in

expensive function based on observations from an experiment. The traditional
framework for developing a predictor with random field models can fail due to
the computational burden it requires. This problem is often seen in cases where
the input of the expensive function is high dimensional. While many previous
works have focused on developing an approximative predictor to resolve these
issues, this article investigates a different solution mechanism. We
demonstrate that when a general set of designs is employed, the resulting
predictor is quick to compute and has reasonable accuracy. The fast computation
of the predictor is made possible through an algorithm proposed by this work.
This paper also demonstrates methods to quickly evaluate the likelihood of the
observations and describes some fast maximum likelihood estimates for unknown
parameters of the random field. The computational savings can be several orders
of magnitude when the input is located in a high dimensional space. Beyond the
fast computation of the predictor, existing research has demonstrated that a
subset of these designs generate predictors that are asymptotically efficient.
This work details some empirical comparisons to the more common space-filling
designs that verify the designs are competitive in terms of resulting
prediction accuracy.

be controlled with the laser intensities and relative phase. We find
characteristic laser frequencies at which the scattering amplitude of a laser
photon into the cavity mode is strongly dependent on the NV center spin. A
scattered photon can be reabsorbed by another selectively driven NV center and
generate a conditional phase (CPHASE) gate. Gate times around 200 ns are within

new traits is essential for survival and requires a high mutation rate.
Precancerous cells acquire a few key mutations that drive rapid population
growth and carcinogenesis. Cancer genomics demonstrates that these few 'driver'
mutations occur alongside thousands of random 'passenger' mutations-a natural
consequence of cancer's elevated mutation rate. Some passengers can be
deleterious to cancer cells, yet have been largely ignored in cancer research.
In population genetics, however, the accumulation of mildly deleterious
mutations has been shown to cause population meltdown. Here we develop a
stochastic population model where beneficial drivers engage in a tug-of-war
with frequent mildly deleterious passengers. These passengers present a barrier
to cancer progression that is described by a critical population size, below
which most lesions fail to progress, and a critical mutation rate, above which
cancers meltdown. We find support for the model in cancer age-incidence and
cancer genomics data that also allow us to estimate the fitness advantage of
drivers and fitness costs of passengers. We identify two regimes of adaptive
evolutionary dynamics and use these regimes to rationalize successes and
failures of different treatment strategies. We find that a tumor's load of
deleterious passengers can explain previously paradoxical treatment outcomes
and suggest that it could potentially serve as a biomarker of response to
mutagenic therapies. Collective deleterious effect of passengers is currently
an unexploited therapeutic target. We discuss how their effects might be
exacerbated by both current and future therapies.

25.55 +/- 0.09 (1.27 Mpc) that compares well with Cepheid and tip of the red

symmetry in $\mathcal{N}=1$ super Yang Mills theory, mediated by the
Ferrara-Zumino hypercurrent ($\mathcal{J}$) with two vector ($\mathcal V$)
supercurrents $(\mathcal{JVV})$ and its manifestation in the anomaly action, in
the form of anomaly poles. This allows to investigate in a unified way both
conformal and chiral anomalies. The analysis is performed in parallel to the
Standard Model, for comparison. We investigate, in particular, massive
deformations of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ theory and the spectral densities of the
anomaly form factors which are extracted from the components of this
correlator. In this extended framework it is shown that all the anomaly form
factors are characterized by spectral densities which flow with the mass
deformation. In particular, the continuum contributions from the two-particle
cuts of the intermediate states turn into into poles in the zero mass limit,
with a single sum rule satisfied by each component. Non anomalous form factors,
instead, in the same anomalous correlators, are characterized by non-integrable
spectral densities. These tend to uniform distributions as one moves towards
the conformal point, with a clear dual behaviour. As in a previous analysis of
the dilaton pole of the Standard Model, also in this case the poles can be
interpreted as signaling the exchange of a composite dilaton/axion/dilatino
(ADD) multiplet in the effective Lagrangian.[...]

boundary condition on the boundaries of the holes is considered. We assume that
the dynamic is driven by a stochastic perturbation on the interior of the
domain and another stochastic perturbation on the boundaries of the holes. The
macroscopic (homogenized) equation is derived as another stochastic partial
differential equation, defined in the whole non perforated domain. Here, the
initial stochastic perturbation on the boundary becomes part of the homogenized
equation as another stochastic force. We use the two-scale convergence method
after extending the solution with 0 in the wholes to pass to the limit. By
It\^o stochastic calculus, we get uniform estimates on the solution in
appropriate spaces. In order to pass to the limit on the boundary integrals, we
rewrite them in terms of integrals in the whole domain. In particular, for the
stochastic integral on the boundary, we combine the previous idea of rewriting
it on the whole domain with the assumption that the Brownian motion is of trace
class. Due to the particular boundary condition dealt with, we get that the
solution of the stochastic homogenized equation is not divergence free.
However, it is coupled with the cell problem that has a divergence free
solution. This paper represents an extension of the results from of Duan and
Wang (Comm. Math. Phys. 275:1508--1527, 2007), where a reaction diffusion
equation with a dynamical boundary condition with a noise source term on both
the interior of the domain and on the boundary was studied, and through a

series of quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations and transition state
theory (TST) methods using high quality 3A' and 3A'' potential energy surfaces
(PESs). Accurate OH (v, j) state resolved cross sections and rate constants on
both potential energy surfaces are presented and fitted for OH at (v = 0, j =
0-16) and (v = 1, j = 0-6). The cross sections were calculated for different
collisional energies (Ec), ranging from the threshold energy at each specific
rovibrational state up to 1.0 eV with step sizes of 0.1 eV or less. They
increase steeply with collision energy when the barrier to reaction can be
overcome, after which the cross sections stay nearly constant with energy.
State resolved rate constants in the temperature range 200-2500 K are presented
based on the cross sections. Total thermal rate constants were calculated by
summing the rates for reaction on the 3A' and 3A'' potential energy surfaces
weighted by 1/3 and taking into account the thermal populations of the
rovibrational states of the OH molecules. It is shown that the improved
canonical variational transition (CVT) treatments with the approximation of
zero-curvature tunneling (ZCT) or small-curvature tunneling (SCT) produce
results more in accord with the QCT results than the TST and CVT methods. The
reactions are governed by the direct reaction mechanism. The rate constants for
OH in excited vibrational and rotational states are orders of magnitude larger
than the thermal rate constants, which needs to be taken into account in
astrochemical models.

to learning a compact binary encoding, which exploits both pair-wise proximity
and class-label information on training data set. Exploiting this extra
information allows the development of encodings which, although compact,
outperform the original high-dimensional features in terms of final
classification or retrieval performance. The method is general, in that it is
applicable to both non-parametric and parametric learning methods. This
generality means that the embedded features are suitable for a wide variety of
computer vision tasks, such as image classification and content-based image
retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that the new compact descriptor
achieves an accuracy comparable to, and in some cases better than, the visual
descriptor in the original space despite being significantly more compact.
Moreover, any convex loss function and convex regularization penalty (e.g., $

found to be different between the two orthogonal components of the effective

the temperature dependence of the two components: the damping-like term
decreases whereas the field-like term increases with increasing temperature.
Using a simple spin diffusion-spin transfer model, we find that all of these

spin transport in this system is different from conventional metallic
interfaces or effects other spin diffusion into the magnetic layer need to be
taken account in order to model the system accurately.

how people evaluate risk in experimental settings. According to prospect
theory, people are risk-averse with respect to gains and risk-seeking with
respect to losses, a phenomenon called ""loss aversion"". Despite of the fact
that prospect theory has been well developed in behavioral economics at the
theoretical level, there exist very few large-scale empirical studies and most
of them have been undertaken with micro-panel data. Here we analyze over 28.5
million trades made by 81.3 thousand traders of an online financial trading
community over 28 months, aiming to explore the large-scale empirical aspect of
prospect theory. By analyzing and comparing the behavior of winning and losing
trades and traders, we find clear evidence of the loss aversion phenomenon, an
essence in prospect theory. This work hence demonstrates an unprecedented
large-scale empirical evidence of prospect theory, which has immediate
implication in financial trading, e.g., developing new trading strategies by
minimizing the effect of loss aversion. Moreover, we introduce three
risk-adjusted metrics inspired by prospect theory to differentiate winning and
losing traders based on their historical trading behavior. This offers us
potential opportunities to augment online social trading, where traders are
allowed to watch and follow the trading activities of others, by predicting
potential winners statistically based on their historical trading behavior
rather than their trading performance at any given point in time.

time can be a potentially persuasive argument that a common process affected
the populations. Oaks et al. (2013) assessed the ability of an
approximate-Bayesian method (msBayes) to estimate such a pattern of
simultaneous divergence across taxa, to which Hickerson et al. (2014)
responded. Both papers agree the method is sensitive to prior assumptions and
often erroneously supports shared divergences; the papers differ about the
explanation and solution. Oaks et al. (2013) suggested the method's behavior is
caused by the strong weight of uniform priors on divergence times leading to
smaller marginal likelihoods of models with more divergence-time parameters
(Hypothesis 1); they proposed alternative priors to avoid strongly weighted
posteriors. Hickerson et al. (2014) suggested numerical approximation error
causes msBayes analyses to be biased toward models of clustered divergences
(Hypothesis 2); they proposed using narrow, empirical uniform priors. Here, we
demonstrate that the approach of Hickerson et al. (2014) does not mitigate the
method's tendency to erroneously support models of clustered divergences, and
often excludes the true parameter values. Our results also show that the
tendency of msBayes analyses to support models of shared divergences is
primarily due to Hypothesis 1. This series of papers demonstrate that if our
prior assumptions place too much weight in unlikely regions of parameter space
such that the exact posterior supports the wrong model of evolutionary history,
no amount of computation can rescue our inference. Fortunately, more flexible
distributions that accommodate prior uncertainty about parameters without
placing excessive weight in vast regions of parameter space with low likelihood
increase the method's robustness and power to detect temporal variation in
divergences.

questions. In particular, we present a useful and powerful characterization of
linear trellis isomorphy. We also obtain a new proof of the Factorization
Theorem of Koetter/Vardy and point out unnoticed problems for the group case.
  Next, we apply our work to: describe all the elementary trellis

minimal linear trellises for a given code; prove that nonmergeable one-to-one
linear trellises are strikingly determined by the edge-label sequences of
certain closed paths; prove self-duality theorems for minimal linear trellises;
analyze quasi-cyclic linear trellises and consequently extend results on

  Our classification results are important for iterative decoding as we show
that minimal linear trellises can yield different pseudocodewords even if they

the linear spectral statistic, which we characterize with simple formulas. The
utility of our proposed framework is demonstrated through application to three
different linear statistics problems: the classical likelihood ratio test for a

generation cellular networks. Because mmWave signals are sensitive to blockage,
prior models for cellular networks operated in the ultra high frequency (UHF)
band do not apply to analyze mmWave cellular networks directly. Leveraging
concepts from stochastic geometry, this paper proposes a general framework to
evaluate the coverage and rate performance in mmWave cellular networks. Using a
distance-dependent line-of-site (LOS) probability function, the locations of
the LOS and non-LOS base stations are modeled as two independent
non-homogeneous Poisson point processes, to which different path loss laws are
applied. Based on the proposed framework, expressions for the
signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) and rate coverage probability are
derived. The mmWave coverage and rate performance are examined as a function of
the antenna geometry and base station density. The case of dense networks is
further analyzed by applying a simplified system model, in which the LOS region
of a user is approximated as a fixed LOS ball. The results show that dense
mmWave networks can achieve comparable coverage and much higher data rates than
conventional UHF cellular systems, despite the presence of blockages. The
results suggest that the cell size to achieve the optimal SINR scales with the
average size of the area that is LOS to a user.

under slow external driving. According to the quantum adiabatic theorem, no
transitions occur between non-degenerate instantaneous eigen-energy levels in
such a dynamical evolution. However, this is true only when the driving rate is
infinitesimally small. For a small nonzero driving rate, there are generally
small transition probabilities between the energy levels. We develop a
classical mechanics framework to address the small deviations from the quantum
adiabatic theorem order by order. A hierarchy of Hamiltonians are constructed
iteratively with the zeroth-order Hamiltonian being determined by the original
system Hamiltonian. The $k$th-order deviations are governed by a $k$th-order
Hamiltonian, which depends on the time derivatives of the adiabatic parameters
up to the $k$th-order. Two simple examples, the Landau-Zener model and a
spin-1/2 particle in a rotating magnetic field, are used to illustrate our
hierarchical theory. Our analysis also exposes a deep, previously unknown

(SWIPT) in a multiuser wireless system, in which distributed transmitters send
independent messages to their respective receivers, and at the same time
cooperatively transmit wireless power to the receivers via energy beamforming.
Accordingly, from the wireless information transmission (WIT) perspective, the
system of interest can be modeled as the classic interference channel, while it
also can be regarded as a distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
system for collaborative wireless energy transmission (WET). To enable both
information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH) in SWIPT, we adopt the
low-complexity time switching operation at each receiver to switch between the
ID and EH modes over scheduled time. Based on this hybrid model, we aim to
characterize the achievable rate-energy (R-E) trade-offs in the multiuser SWIPT
system under various transmitter-side collaboration schemes. Specifically, to
facilitate the collaborative energy beamforming, we propose a new signal
splitting scheme at the transmitters, where each transmit signal is generally
composed of an information signal component and an energy signal component for
WIT and WET, respectively. With this new scheme, first, we study the two-user
SWIPT system and derive the optimal mode switching rule at the receivers and
the corresponding transmit signal optimization to achieve various R-E
trade-offs over the fading channel. We also compare the R-E performance of our
proposed scheme with transmit energy beamforming and signal splitting against
two existing schemes with partial or no cooperation of the transmitters, and
show remarkable gains over these baseline schemes. Finally, the general case of
SWIPT systems with more than two users is studied, for which we propose and
compare two practical transmit collaboration schemes.

discrete $Z_{3}$ symmetry that stabilizes a weak scale scalar dark matter $X$.
The model assumes a hidden sector with a local $U(1)_X$ dark gauge symmetry,
which is broken spontaneously into $Z_3$ subgroup by nonzero VEV of dark Higgs
field $\phi_X$ ($ \langle \phi_X \rangle \neq 0$). Compared with global $Z_3$
DM models, the local $Z_3$ model has two new extra fields: a dark gauge field
$Z^{'}$ and a dark Higgs field $\phi$ (a remnant of the $U(1)_X$ breaking).
After imposing various constraints including the upper bounds on the
spin-independent direct detection cross section and thermal relic density, we
find that the scalar DM with mass less than $125$ GeV is allowed in the local
$Z_3$ model, in contrary to the global $Z_3$ model. This is due to new channels
in the DM pair annihilations open into $Z^{'}$ and $\phi$ in the local $Z_3$
model. Most parts of the newly open DM mass region can be probed by XENON1T and
other similar future experiments. Also if $\phi$ is light enough (a few MeV
$\lesssim m_\phi \lesssim$ O(100) MeV), it can generate a right size of DM
self-interaction and explain the astrophysical small scale structure anomalies.
This would lead to exotic decays of Higgs boson into a pair of dark Higgs
bosons, which could be tested at LHC and ILC.

X_b is below the B\bar B^* threshold and the mass difference between the
neutral and charged bottom meson is small compared to the binding energy of the
X_b, the isospin violating decay mode X_b\to \Upsilon (nS)\pi^+\pi^- would be
greatly suppressed. This will promote the importance of the radiative decays.
We use the effective Lagrangian based on the heavy quark symmetry to explore
the rescattering mechanism and calculate the partial widths. Our results show
that the partial widths into \gamma \Upsilon(nS) are about 1 keV, and thus the
branching fractions may be sizeable, considering the fact the total width may
also be smaller than a few MeV like the X(3872). These radiative decay modes
are of great importance in the experimental search for the X_b particularly at

describe the collective behaviour of a large number of individual
micro-junctions forming a macroscopic frictional interface. Each micro-junction
can switch in time between two states: A pinned state characterized by a
displacement-dependent force, and a slipping state characterized by a
time-dependent force. Instead of tracking each micro-junction individually, the
state of the interface is described by two coupled distributions for (i) the
stretching of pinned junctions and (ii) the time spent in the slipping state.
We show how this framework represents an overarching structure for important
models existing in the friction literature. We then use it to study
systematically the effect of the time-scale that controls the duration of the
slipping state. We first find the steady-state friction force as a function of
the sliding velocity. As the framework allows for a whole family of
micro-junction behaviour laws, we show how these laws can be chosen to obtain
monotonic (strengthening or weakening) or non-monotonic velocity dependence at
the macroscale. By then considering transient situations, we predict that the
macroscopic static friction coefficient is strongly influenced by the way the
interface was prepared, in particular by the slip dynamics of the previous
sliding event. We also show that slow slip spontaneously occurs in the
framework for a wide range of behaviour laws.

that assortativity, modularity and average path length have a positive
correlation with network robustness, whereas clustering coefficient has a
negative correlation. We did not find any correlation between scale-free
exponent and robustness, or rich-club profiles and robustness. The robustness
of small-world networks on the other hand, show substantial positive
correlations with assortativity, modularity, clustering coefficient and average
path length. In comparison, the robustness of Erdos-Renyi random networks did
not have any significant correlation with any of the network properties
considered. A significant observation is that high clustering decreases
topological robustness in scale-free networks, yet it increases topological
robustness in small-world networks. Our results highlight the importance of

has great effect on general relativity, which gives new challenges on
gravitational redshift. When rotation is taken into consideration spherical
symmetry is lost and off diagonal terms appear in the metric. The geometry of
space time can be then described by using the solutions of Kerr family. In the
present paper we discuss the gravitational redshift for rotating body by using
Kerr metric. The numerical calculations has been done under Newtonian
approximation of angular momentum. It has been found that the value of
gravitational redshift is influenced by the direction of spin of central body
and also on the position (latitude) on the central body at which the photon is
emitted. The variation of gravitational redshift from equatorial to non -
equatorial region has been calculated and its implications are discussed in
detail.

with a spherical symmetry. Over the last decades the geophysical observations
have revealed, at different spatial scales, the existence of several
perturbations from this basic structure. In this paper we discuss the
hemispheric perturbations induced to this basic structure if the inner core is
displaced from the center of mass of the Earth. Using numerical simulations of
the observed hemispheric asymmetry of the seismic waves traveling through the
upper inner core, with faster arrival times and higher attenuation in the
Eastern Hemisphere, we estimate that the present position of the inner core is
shifted by tens of kilometers from the Earth's center eastward in the
equatorial plane. If the only forces acting on the inner core were the
gravitational forces, then its equilibrium position would be at the Earth's
center and the estimated displacement would not be possible. We conjecture
that, due to interactions with the flow and the magnetic field inside the outer
core, the inner core is in a permanent chaotic motion. To support this
hypothesis we analyze more than ten different geophysical phenomena consistent
with an inner core motion dominated by time scales from hundreds to thousands
of years.

asymmetric doping of graphene layers. Here we introduce a new design strategy
that places a bilayer graphene sheet sandwiched between two cladding layers of
materials that possess strong spin-orbit coupling (e.g., Bi2Te3). Our ab initio
and tight-binding calculations show that proximity enhanced spin-orbit coupling
effect opens a large (44 meV) band gap in bilayer graphene without breaking its
lattice symmetry, and the band gap can be effectively tuned by interlayer
stacking pattern and significantly enhanced by interlayer compression. The
feasibility of this quantum-well structure is demonstrated by recent
experimental realization of high-quality heterojunctions between graphene and
Bi2Te3, and this design also conforms to existing fabrication techniques in the
semiconductor industry. The proposed quantum-well structure is expected to be
especially robust since it does not require an external power supply to open
and maintain a band gap, and the cladding layers provide protection against
environmental degradation of the graphene layer in its device applications.

quantifies the extent to which such social bootstrapping is effective in
enhancing a social experience of the website. First, we develop a stylised
analytical model that suggests that copying tends to produce a giant connected
component (i.e., a connected community) quickly and preserves properties such
as reciprocity and clustering, up to a linear multiplicative factor. Second, we
use data from two websites, Pinterest and Last.fm, to empirically compare the
subgraph of links copied from Facebook to links created natively. We find that
the copied subgraph has a giant component, higher reciprocity and clustering,
and confirm that the copied connections see higher social interactions.
However, the need for copying diminishes as users become more active and
influential. Such users tend to create links natively on the website, to users
who are more similar to them than their Facebook friends. Our findings give new
insights into understanding how bootstrapping from established social networks

out-of-equilibrium (non-thermal) distribution of optically excited electrons.
Non-equilibrium dynamics relaxes this distribution on an ultrafast timescale to
a hot Fermi-Dirac distribution with a well-defined temperature. The advent of
time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES) experiments has
made it possible to track the decay of the temperature of the excited hot
electrons in selected states in the Brillouin zone, and to reveal their cooling
in unprecedented detail in a variety of emerging materials. It is, however, not
a straightforward task to determine the temperature with high accuracy. This is
mainly attributable to an a priori unknown position of the Fermi level and the
fact that the shape of the Fermi edge can be severely perturbed when the state
in question is crossing the Fermi energy. Here, we introduce a method that
circumvents these difficulties and accurately extracts both the temperature and
the position of the Fermi level for a hot carrier distribution by tracking the
occupation statistics of the carriers measured in a TR-ARPES experiment.

co-channel interference. We first derive the closed-form expressions of
cumulative distribution function (CDF) for received
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the terminal. Based on the
results for CDF, the lower bounds, approximate expressions as well as the
asymptotic expressions for outage probability and sum BER are derived in
closed-form with different computational complexities and accuracies. The
approximate expression for ergodic sum rate is also presented. With the
theoretic results, we consider the optimal power allocation at the relay and
optimal relay location problems that aiming to minimize the outage and sum BER
performances of the protocol. It is shown that jointly optimization of power
and relay location can provide the best performance. Simulation results are
presented to study the effect of system parameters while verify the theoretic
analysis. The results show that three-phase TWR protocol can outperform
two-phase TWR protocol in ergodic sum rate when the interference power at the
relay is much larger than that at the terminals. This is in sharp contrast with
the conclusion in interference free scenario. Moreover, we show that an
estimation error on the interference channel will not affect the system
performance significantly, while a very small estimation error on the desired

Accepted in Astronomy and Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201321911",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In protoplanetary disks, the inner boundary between the turbulent and laminar
regions could be a promising site for planet formation, thanks to the trapping
of solids at the boundary itself or in vortices generated by the Rossby wave
instability. At the interface, the disk thermodynamics and the turbulent
dynamics are entwined because of the importance of turbulent dissipation and
thermal ionization. Numerical models of the boundary, however, have neglected
the thermodynamics, and thus miss a part of the physics. The aim of this paper
is to numerically investigate the interplay between thermodynamics and dynamics
in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks by properly accounting for
turbulent heating and the dependence of the resistivity on the local
temperature. Using the Godunov code RAMSES, we performed a series of 3D global
numerical simulations of protoplanetary disks in the cylindrical limit,
including turbulent heating and a simple prescription for radiative cooling. We
find that waves excited by the turbulence significantly heat the dead zone, and
we subsequently provide a simple theoretical framework for estimating the wave
heating and consequent temperature profile. In addition, our simulations reveal
that the dead-zone inner edge can propagate outward into the dead zone, before
staling at a critical radius that can be estimated from a mean-field model. The
engine driving the propagation is in fact density wave heating close to the
interface. A pressure maximum appears at the interface in all simulations, and
we note the emergence of the Rossby wave instability in simulations with
extended azimuth. Our simulations illustrate the complex interplay between
thermodynamics and turbulent dynamics in the inner regions of protoplanetary
disks. They also reveal how important activity at the dead-zone interface can
be for the dead-zone thermodynamic structure.

consider two models, one with short- and one with long-ranged solvent-solvent
and solvent-wall interactions. The analytic results reveal in a transparent way
that wetting transitions in electrolyte solutions, which occur far away from
their critical point (i.e., the bulk correlation length is less than half of
the Debye length) are always first-order if the solvent-solvent and
solvent-wall interactions are short-ranged. In contrast, wetting transitions
close to the bulk critical point of the solvent (i.e., the bulk correlation
length is larger than the Debye length) exhibit the same wetting behavior as
the pure, i.e., salt-free, solvent. If the salt-free solvent is governed by
long-ranged solvent-solvent as well as long-ranged solvent-wall interactions

ion-induced first-order thin-thick transition which precedes the subsequent
continuous wetting as for the salt-free solvent.

behind a residual population of candidate multi-planet transiting systems
expected to have a false-positive rate less than 1%. We present a sample of 340
planetary systems that contain 851 planets that are validated to substantially
better than the 99% confidence level; the vast majority of these have not been
previously verified as planets. We expect ~2 unidentified false-positives
making our sample of planet very reliable. We present fundamental planetary
properties of our sample based on a comprehensive analysis of Kepler light
curves and ground-based spectroscopy and high-resolution imaging. Since we do
not require spectroscopy or high-resolution imaging for validation, some of our
derived parameters for a planetary system may be systematically incorrect due
to dilution from light due to additional stars in the photometric aperture.
None the less, our result nearly doubles the number of verified exoplanets.

plateau and a very late rebrightening both in X-ray and optical bands. The
similar behavior of the optical and X-ray light curves suggests that they maybe
have a common origin. The long plateau starts from several hundred seconds and
ends at tens of thousands seconds. The peak time of the late rebrightening is
about 30000 s. We analyze the energy injection model by means of numerical and
analytical solutions, considering both the wind environment and ISM environment
for GRB afterglows. We especially study the influence of the injection starting
time, ending time, stellar wind density (or density of the circumburst
environment), and injection luminosity on the shape of the afterglow light
curves, respectively. We find that the light curve is largely affected by the
parameters in the wind model. There is a ""bump"" at the late time only in the
wind model too. In the wind case, it is interesting that the longer the energy
injected, the more obvious the rebrightening will be. We also find the peak
time of bump is determined by the stellar wind density. We use the late
continuous injection model to interpret the unusual afterglow of GRB 120326A.
The model can well fit the observational data, however, we find that the time
scale of the injection must be larger than ten thousands seconds. This implies
that the time scale of the central engine activity must be more than ten
thousands seconds. This can give useful constraints on the central engine of
GRBs. We consider a new born millisecond pulsar with strong magnetic field as
the central engine. On the other hand, our results suggest that the circumburst

analyze the historical data to find a statistical model that gives relation

thus supporting the very hot nature of the hot component diagnosed with

Some of the
basic ideas of electrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics of mean fields in
turbulently moving conducting fluids are explained. It is stressed that the
connection of the mean electromotive force with the mean magnetic field and its
first spatial derivatives is in general neither local nor instantaneous and
that quite a few claims concerning pretended failures of the mean-field concept
result from ignoring this aspect. In addition to the mean-field dynamo
mechanisms of $\alpha^2$ and $\alpha$ $\Omega$ type several others are
considered. Much progress in mean-field electrodynamics and
magnetohydrodynamics results from the test-field method for calculating the
coefficients that determine the connection of the mean electromotive force with
the mean magnetic field. As an important example the memory effect in
homogeneous isotropic turbulence is explained. In magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence there is the possibility of a mean electromotive force that is
primarily independent of the mean magnetic field and labeled as Yoshizawa
effect. Despite of many efforts there is so far no convincing comprehensive
theory of $\alpha$ quenching, that is, the reduction of the $\alpha$ effect
with growing mean magnetic field, and of the saturation of mean-field dynamos.
Steps toward such a theory are explained. Finally, some remarks on laboratory
experiments with dynamos are made.

filamentary structures observed in active regions near polarity inversion lines
that resemble the penumbra of regular sunspots but are not connected to any
umbra. We use Hinode data from the Solar Optical Telescope to determine the
properties of orphan penumbrae. Spectropolarimetric data are employed to obtain
the vector magnetic field and line-of-sight velocities in the photosphere.
Magnetograms are used to study the overall evolution of these structures, and
G-band and Ca II H filtergrams are to investigate their brightness and apparent
horizontal motions. Orphan penumbrae form between regions of opposite polarity
in places with horizontal magnetic fields. Their magnetic configuration is that
of $\Omega$-shaped flux ropes. In the two cases studied here, the
opposite-polarity regions approach each other with time and the whole structure
submerges as the penumbral filaments disappear. Orphan penumbrae are very
similar to regular penumbrae, including the existence of strong gas flows.
Therefore, they could have a similar origin. The main difference between them
is the absence of a ""background"" magnetic field in orphan penumbrae. This could
explain most of the observed differences. The fast flows we detect in orphan
penumbrae may be caused by the siphon flow mechanism. Based on the similarities
between orphan and regular penumbrae, we propose that the Evershed flow is also
a manifestation of siphon flows.

LG motion cannot be recovered to better than $150-200 km s^{-1}$ in amplitude
and within a $\approx10^\circ$ in direction. The tests rely on catalogs of mock
galaxies identified in the Millennium simulation using semi-analytic galaxy
formation models. We compare these results to the $K_s=11.75$ Two-Mass Galaxy
Redshift Survey, which provides the deepest, widest and most complete spatial
distribution of galaxies available so far. In our analysis we use a new,
concise relation for deriving the LG motion and bulk flow from the true
distribution of galaxies in redshift space. Our results show that the main
source of uncertainty is the small effective depth of surveys like the 2MRS
that prevents a proper sampling of the large scale structure beyond $\sim100
h^{-1} Mpc$. Deeper redshift surveys are needed to reach the ""convergence
scale"" of $\approx 250 h^{-1}Mpc $ in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. Deeper survey
would also mitigate the impact of the ""Kaiser rocket"" which, in a survey like
2MRS, remains a significant source of uncertainty. Thanks to the quiet and
moderate density environment of the LG, purely dynamical uncertainties of the
linear predictions are subdominant at the level of $\sim 90 km s^{-1}$.

Guidelines could be (i) the connection between zero neutrino charges (and
therefore a possibility to be Majorana particle), smallness of the neutrino
mass and large lepton mixing, (ii) joint description of leptons and quarks,
(iii) existence of the right handed (RH) neutrinos without special quantum
numbers. Properties of the RH neutrinos and the UV completion of the seesaw may
turn out to be the key to understand the neutrino mass and mixing. In view of
the LHC results minimalistic scenarios like $\nu$MSM look rather plausible.
Still the GUT's with additional hidden sector, QLC, high scale flavor
symmetries are appealing. Concerning mixing, the main issue is ""symmetry or no
symmetry"" behind the observed pattern. The symmetry group condition is useful

calculating contributions from the electromagnetic quantum induced energy and

briefly reviewing the conventional approaches developed by Lifshitz el al and
more recent attempts by others, we emphasize the need to accommodate the
effects due to the classical constitutive properties of the material in any
experimental attempt to detect such contributions. Attention is then
concentrated on a particular system composed of an ENZ-type (epsilon-near-zero)
meta-material, chosen to have an anisotropic and inhomogeneous permittivity
confined in an infinitely long perfectly conducting open waveguide. This
permits us to deduce from the source-free Maxwell's equations a complete set of
harmonic electromagnetic evanescent eigen-modes and eigen-frequencies. Since
these solutions prohibit the existence of asymptotic scattering states in the
guide an alternative regularization scheme, based on the Euler-Maclaurin
formula, enables us to prescribe precise criteria for the extraction of finite
quantum expectation values from regularized mode sums together with error
bounds on these values. This scheme is used to derive analytic results for
regularized energy densities in the guide. The criteria are exploited to
construct a numerical scheme that is bench-marked by comparing its output with
the analytic results derived from the special properties of the inhomogeneous
ENZ medium.

differential rotation from high-precision, evenly sampled photometric time
series. It is applied to main-sequence late-type stars whose optical flux
modulation is dominated by starspots. An autocorrelation of the time series was
used to select stars that allow an accurate determination of starspot rotation
periods. A simple two-spot model was applied together with a Bayesian
information criterion to preliminarily select intervals of the time series
showing evidence of differential rotation with starspots of almost constant
area. Finally, the significance of the differential rotation detection and a
measurement of its amplitude and uncertainty were obtained by an a posteriori
Bayesian analysis based on a Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach. We applied our
method to the Sun and eight other stars for which previous spot modelling had
been performed to compare our results with previous ones. We find that
autocorrelation is a simple method for selecting stars with a coherent
rotational signal that is a prerequisite for successfully measuring
differential rotation through spot modelling. For a proper Monte Carlo Markov
Chain analysis, it is necessary to take the strong correlations among different
parameters that exist in spot modelling into account. For the planet-hosting
star Kepler-30, we derive a lower limit to the relative amplitude of the
differential rotation of \Delta P / P = 0.0523 \pm 0.0016. We confirm that the
Sun as a star in the optical passband is not suitable for measuring
differential rotation owing to the rapid evolution of its photospheric active
regions. In general, our method performs well in comparison to more
sophisticated and time-consuming approaches.

geometrically confirmed by our lens model corresponding to deflection angles
that are 12% larger than the lower-redshift systems used to calibrate the lens

to be multiply lensed given their locations in the image plane and the
brightness of foreground galaxies, but are magnified by factors of ~1.3-15, so
that we are seeing further down the luminosity function than comparable deep
field imaging. It is apparent that the redshift distribution of these sources
does not smoothly extend over the full redshift range accessible at z<12, but
appears to break above z=9. Nine candidates are clustered within a small region
of 20"" across, representing a potentially unprecedented concentration. Given
the poor statistics, however, we must await similar constraints from the
additional HFF clusters to properly examine this trend. The physical properties
of our candidates are examined using the range of lens models developed for the
HFF program by various groups including our own, for a better estimate of
underlying systematics. Our spectral-energy-distribution fits for the brightest

nonanalytic behavior at $d=2$. We calculate the first and second moments of the
