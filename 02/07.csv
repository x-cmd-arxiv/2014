Recently, the idea of using another quantum system - which is experimentally
more controllable - as a simulator for the original problem has gained
significant momentum. Amongst the experimental platforms studied as quantum
simulators, superconducting qubits are one of the most promising, due to
relative straightforward scalability, easy design, and integration with
standard electronics. Here I review the recent state-of-the art in the field
and the prospects for simulating systems ranging from relativistic quantum
fields to quantum many-body systems.

functions. They have been applied to both regression and non-linear
dimensionality reduction, and offer desirable properties such as uncertainty
estimates, robustness to over-fitting, and principled ways for tuning
hyper-parameters. However the scalability of these models to big datasets
remains an active topic of research. We introduce a novel re-parametrisation of
variational inference for sparse GP regression and latent variable models that
allows for an efficient distributed algorithm. This is done by exploiting the
decoupling of the data given the inducing points to re-formulate the evidence
lower bound in a Map-Reduce setting. We show that the inference scales well
with data and computational resources, while preserving a balanced distribution
of the load among the nodes. We further demonstrate the utility in scaling
Gaussian processes to big data. We show that GP performance improves with
increasing amounts of data in regression (on flight data with 2 million
records) and latent variable modelling (on MNIST). The results show that GPs
perform better than many common models often used for big data.

traditionally been used to infer the amount of water brought to Earth by
comets. Measuring this ratio in deeply-embedded low-mass protostars makes it
possible to probe the critical stage when water is transported from clouds to
disks in which icy bodies are formed. We present sub-arcsecond resolution
observations of HDO in combination with H$_2^{18}$O from the PdBI toward the
three low-mass protostars NGC 1333-IRAS 2A, IRAS 4A-NW, and IRAS 4B. The
resulting HDO/H$_2$O ratio is $7.4\pm2.1\times10^{-4}$ for IRAS 2A,
$19.1\pm5.4\times10^{-4}$ for IRAS 4A-NW, and $5.9\pm1.7\times10^{-4}$ for IRAS
4B. Derived ratios agree with radiative transfer models within a factor of 2-4
depending on the source. Our HDO/H$_2$O ratios for the inner regions (where
$T>100$ K) of four young protostars are only a factor of 2 higher than those
found for pristine, solar system comets. These small differences suggest that
little processing of water occurs between the deeply embedded stage and the
formation of planetesimals and comets.

the double-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 film shows an insulating behavior. Such a dramatic

surprising and the underlying origin remains unclear. Here we report our
comparative study between the single-layer and double-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films
by performing a systematic angle-resolved photoemission study on the samples
annealed in vacuum. We find that, like the single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 film, the
as-prepared double-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 film is insulating and possibly magnetic,
thus establishing a universal existence of the magnetic phase in the
FeSe/SrTiO3 films. In particular, the double-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 film shows a
quite different doping behavior from the single-layer film in that it is hard
to get doped and remains in the insulating state under an extensive annealing
condition. The difference originates from the much reduced doping efficiency in
the bottom FeSe layer of the double-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 film from the FeSe-SrTiO3
interface. These observations provide key insights in understanding the origin
of superconductivity and the doping mechanism in the FeSe/SrTiO3 films. The

  steer populations to local optima","full paper plus supplementary materials","PLoS ONE 9(2): e86635 (2014)","10.1371/journal.pone.0086635",,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Genotype-phenotype (GP) maps specify how the random mutations that change
genotypes generate variation by altering phenotypes, which, in turn, can
trigger selection. Many GP maps share the following general properties: 1) The
number of genotypes $N_G$ is much larger than the number of selectable
phenotypes; 2) Neutral exploration changes the variation that is accessible to
the population; 3) The distribution of phenotype frequencies $F_p=N_p/N_G$,
with $N_p$ the number of genotypes mapping onto phenotype $p$, is highly
biased: the majority of genotypes map to only a small minority of the
phenotypes. Here we explore how these properties affect the evolutionary
dynamics of haploid Wright-Fisher models that are coupled to a simplified and
general random GP map or to a more complex RNA sequence to secondary structure
map. For both maps the probability of a mutation leading to a phenotype $p$
scales to first order as $F_p$, although for the RNA map there are further
correlations as well. By using mean-field theory, supported by computer
simulations, we show that the discovery time $T_p$ of a phenotype $p$ similarly
scales to first order as $1/F_p$ for a wide range of population sizes and
mutation rates in both the monomorphic and polymorphic regimes. These
differences in the rate at which variation arises can vary over many orders of
magnitude. Phenotypic variation with a larger $F_p$ is therefore be much more
likely to arise than variation with a small $F_p$. We show, using the RNA
model, that frequent phenotypes (with larger $F_p$) can fix in a population
even when alternative, but less frequent, phenotypes with much higher fitness
are potentially accessible. In other words, if the fittest never `arrive' on
the timescales of evolutionary change, then they can't fix. We call this highly
non-ergodic effect the `arrival of the frequent'.

order parameters (OP) may coexist, i.e., the superconducting OP $\Delta$ and
the OP $W$ that characterizes the amplitude of a charge-density wave (CDW). In
the mean field approximation we present equations for the matrix Green's
functions $G_{ik}$, where $i$ relates to the one of the two Fermi sheets and
$k$, operates in the Gor'kov-Nambu space. Using the solutions of these
equations, we find stationary states for different values of the parameter
describing the curvature of the Fermi surface, $\mu$, which can be varied,
e.g., by doping. It is established that in the interval $\mu_1<\mu<\mu_2$ the
self-consistency equations have a solution for coexisting OPs $\Delta$ and $W$.
However, this solution corresponds to a saddle point in the energy functional
$\Phi(\Delta, W)$, i.e., it is unstable. Stable states are: 1)the state with
the CDW at $\mu < \mu_{2}$; and 2) the purely superconducting state at
$\mu_1<\mu$. At $\mu<\mu_0$, the state 1) corresponds to a global minimum, and
at $\mu_0<\mu$, the state 2) has a lower energy, i.e., only the superconducting
state survives at large $\mu$. We study the dynamics of the variations
$\delta\Delta$ and $\delta W$ from these states in the collisionless limit. It
is characterized by two modes of oscillations, the fast and the slow one. The
fast mode is analogous to damped oscillations in conventional superconductors.
The frequency of slow modes depends on the curvature $\mu$ and is much smaller
than $2\Delta$ if the coupling constants for superconductivity and CDW are
close to each other. The considered model can be applied to high-$T_c$
superconductors where the parts of the Fermi surface near the `hot' spots may
be regarded as the considered two Fermi sheets. We also discuss relation of the
considered model to the simplest model for Fe-based pnictides.

intriguing spatially-flat cosmological solutions where a scalar field is forced
to climb up toward the steep potential after an initial singularity, and
additional milder terms can inject an inflationary phase during the ensuing

an infrared suppression is typically followed by a pre-inflationary peak that

that, while the chi^2 fits for the low-l CMB angular power spectrum are clearly

Uncertainty Principle as the energy increases towards the Planck value. It also
entails corrections to the event horizon size as the black hole mass falls to
the Planck value, leading to the concept of a Generalized Event Horizon. One
implication of this is that there could be sub-Planckian black holes with a
size of order their Compton wavelength. Loop quantum gravity suggests the

interface perturbation between the gases, which can be imposed exactly for
different simulation codes and resolutions to allow for quantitative
comparison. Well-resolved large-eddy simulations are performed using two
different and independently developed numerical methods with the objective of
assessing turbulence structures, prediction uncertainties and convergence
behaviour. The two numerical methods differ fundamentally with respect to the
employed subgrid-scale regularisation, each representing state-of-the-art
approaches to RMI. Unlike previous studies the focus of the present
investigation is to quantify uncertainties introduced by the numerical method,
as there is strong evidence that subgrid-scale regularisation and truncation
errors may have a significant effect on the linear and non-linear stages of the
RMI evolution. Fourier diagnostics reveal that the larger energy containing
scales converge rapidly with increasing mesh resolution and thus are in
excellent agreement for the two numerical methods. Spectra of gradient
dependent quantities, such as enstrophy and scalar dissipation rate, show
stronger dependencies on the small-scale flow field structures in consequence
of truncation error effects, which for one numerical method are dominantly
dissipative and for the other dominantly dispersive.

  pages 166--172",,,"math.OC math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently a new class of techniques termed the max-plus curse of
dimensionality-free methods have been developed to solve nonlinear optimal
control problems. In these methods the discretization in state space is avoided
by using a max-plus basis expansion of the value function. This requires
storing only the coefficients of the basis functions used for representation.
However, the number of basis functions grows exponentially with respect to the
number of time steps of propagation to the time horizon of the control problem.
This so called ""curse of complexity"" can be managed by applying a pruning
procedure which selects the subset of basis functions that contribute most to
the approximation of the value function. The pruning procedures described thus
far in the literature rely on the solution of a sequence of high dimensional
optimization problems which can become computationally expensive.
  In this paper we show that if the max-plus basis functions are linear and the
region of interest in state space is convex, the pruning problem can be
efficiently solved by the bundle method. This approach combining the bundle
method and semidefinite formulations is applied to the quantum gate synthesis
problem, in which the state space is the special unitary group (which is
non-convex). This is based on the observation that the convexification of the
unitary group leads to an exact relaxation. The results are studied and
validated via examples.

particular, we focus on the universal feature of neutronization burst expected
in the first tens of ms of the signal: provided that a detector with sufficient
sensitivity is available, it is well-known that in the 3 neutrino framework the
detection of the neutronization burst in neutrino channel would signal inverted
mass hierarchy. This conclusion is dramatically altered in the presence of a
sterile neutrino: we study here both analytically and numerically the region in
parameter space where this characteristic signal disappears, mimicking normal
hierarchy expectations. Conversely, the detection of a peak consistent with
expectations for inverted mass hierarchy would exclude the existence of a
sterile state over a much wider parameter space than what required by
laboratory anomalies fits, or even probed by detectors coming on-line in the
near future. Additionally, we show the peculiar alteration in the energy-time
double differential flux, with a delayed peak appearing for kinematical
reasons, which might offer a remarkable signature in case of favorable
parameters and for a high statistics detection of a Galactic SN. We also

important role of dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) in the assembly of
stellar mass and the evolution of massive galaxies in the Universe. The
brightest of these galaxies have infrared luminosities in excess of 10$^{13}$
L$_{\odot}$ with implied star-formation rates of thousands of solar masses per
year. They represent the most intense starbursts in the Universe, yet many are
completely optically obscured. Their easy detection at submm wavelengths is due
to dust heated by ultraviolet radiation of newly forming stars. When summed up,
all of the dusty, star-forming galaxies in the Universe produce an infrared
radiation field that has an equal energy density as the direct starlight
emission from all galaxies visible at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. The
bulk of this infrared extragalactic background light emanates from galaxies as
diverse as gas-rich disks to mergers of intense starbursting galaxies. Major
advances in far-infrared instrumentation in recent years, both space-based and
ground-based, has led to the detection of nearly a million DSFGs, yet our
understanding of the underlying astrophysics that govern the start and end of
the dusty starburst phase is still in nascent stage. This review is aimed at
summarizing the current status of DSFG studies, focusing especially on the
detailed characterization of the best-understood subset (submillimeter
galaxies, who were summarized in the last review of this field over a decade
ago, Blain et al., 2002), but also the selection and characterization of more
recently discovered DSFG populations. We review DSFG population statistics,
their physical properties including dust, gas and stellar contents, their
environments, and current theoretical models related to the formation and
evolution of these galaxies.

$\mathbb{E}[f(x;\theta^*,\xi)]$ over a closed and convex set $X$ in a regime
where $\theta^*$ is unavailable and $\xi$ is a suitably defined random
variable. Instead, $\theta^*$ may be obtained through the solution of a
learning problem that requires minimizing a metric $\mathbb{E}[g(\theta;\eta)]$
in $\theta$ over a closed and convex set $\Theta$. Traditional approaches have
been either sequential or direct variational approaches. In the case of the
former, this entails the following steps: (i) a solution to the learning
problem, namely $\theta^*$, is obtained; and (ii) a solution is obtained to the
associated computational problem which is parametrized by $\theta^*$. Such
avenues prove difficult to adopt particularly since the learning process has to
be terminated finitely and consequently, in large-scale instances, sequential
approaches may often be corrupted by error. On the other hand, a variational
approach requires that the problem may be recast as a possibly non-monotone
stochastic variational inequality problem in the $(x,\theta)$ space; but there
are no known first-order stochastic approximation schemes are currently
available for the solution of this problem. To resolve the absence of
convergent efficient schemes, we present a coupled stochastic approximation
scheme which simultaneously solves both the computational and the learning
problems. The obtained schemes are shown to be equipped with almost sure
convergence properties in regimes when the function $f$ is either strongly
convex as well as merely convex.

is particularly transparent in the Hamiltonian formalism, we provide a concise
discussion of their basic aspects in this context; and as a warming up

higher spin fields, briefly signaling the agreements and discrepancies found
through different approaches. We conclude explaining how the puzzles become
resolved once the fall off of the fields is precisely specified and extended to
include chemical potentials, in a way that it is compatible with the asymptotic
symmetries. Hence, the global charges become completely identified in an
unambiguous way, so that different sets of asymptotic conditions turn out to

have also significantly lower dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared to those of
actively star-forming galaxies of the same mass found both in HCGs and the

stripped out of these systems as a result of the gravitational and hydrodynamic
interactions, experienced due to previous encounters with other group members.
About 40% of the early-type galaxies (mostly lenticulars), in dynamically ""old""

these findings are consistent with an evolutionary scenario in which gas

from a large collection of similar instances (e.g. images, graphs, shapes) to
improve maps between pairs of them. Given multiple matches computed between a
few object pairs in isolation, the goal is to recover an entire collection of
maps that are (1) globally consistent, and (2) close to the provided maps ---
and under certain conditions provably the ground-truth maps. Despite recent
advances on this problem, the best-known recovery guarantees are limited to a
small constant barrier --- none of the existing methods find theoretical
support when more than $50\%$ of input correspondences are corrupted. Moreover,
prior approaches focus mostly on fully similar objects, while it is practically
more demanding to match instances that are only partially similar to each
other.
  In this paper, we develop an algorithm to jointly match multiple objects that
exhibit only partial similarities, given a few pairwise matches that are
densely corrupted. Specifically, we propose to recover the ground-truth maps
via a parameter-free convex program called MatchLift, following a spectral
method that pre-estimates the total number of distinct elements to be matched.
Encouragingly, MatchLift exhibits near-optimal error-correction ability, i.e.
in the asymptotic regime it is guaranteed to work even when a dominant fraction
$1-\Theta\left(\frac{\log^{2}n}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$ of the input maps behave like
random outliers. Furthermore, MatchLift succeeds with minimal input complexity,
namely, perfect matching can be achieved as soon as the provided maps form a
connected map graph. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on various benchmark
data sets including synthetic examples and real-world examples, all of which
confirm the practical applicability of MatchLift.

evidenced. In the latter case, the full time dependent elastic response is in

they are well confined and well scattered by the Galactic magnetic field. Due
to the disklike shape of the confinement volume, transport in the vertical
direction, perpendicular to the mean Galactic magnetic field, is key to cosmic
ray escape. It has long been recognized that this vertical transport depends
both on the vertical component of the fieldlines themselves and on the extent
to which the cosmic rays are tied to the fieldlines. In this paper we use
magnetic fields with very simple spatial and temporal structure to isolate some
important features of cross fieldline transport. We show that even simple
magnetic nonuniformities combined with pitch angle scattering can enhance cross
fieldline transport by several orders of magnitude, while pitch angle
scattering is unnecessary for enhanced transport if the field is chaotic.
Nevertheless, perpendicular transport is much less than parallel transport in
all the cases we study. We apply the results to confinement of cosmic rays in
the Fermi Bubbles.

discuss how an unknown UV completion can complicate determining inflationary
model parameters from observations, even from precision measurements. Besides
the usual naturalness issues associated with having a shallow inflationary
potential, we describe another issue for inflation, namely, unknown UV physics
modifies the running of Standard Model (SM) parameters and thereby introduces
uncertainty into the potential inflationary predictions. We illustrate this
point using the minimal Higgs Inflationary scenario, which is arguably the most
predictive single-field model on the market, because its predictions for $A_s$,
$r$ and $n_s$ are made using only one new free parameter beyond those measured
in particle physics experiments, and run up to the inflationary regime. We find
that this issue can already have observable effects. At the same time, this
UV-parameter dependence in the Renormalization Group allows Higgs Inflation to
occur (in principle) for a slightly larger range of Higgs masses. We comment on
the origin of the various UV scales that arise at large field values for the SM
Higgs, clarifying cut off scale arguments by further developing the formalism
of a non-linear realization of $\rm SU_L(2) \times U(1)$ in curved space. We
discuss the interesting fact that, outside of Higgs Inflation, the effect of a
non-minimal coupling to gravity, even in the SM, results in a non-linear EFT
for the Higgs sector. Finally, we briefly comment on post BICEP2 attempts to
modify the Higgs Inflation scenario.

theory. Late-time infalling observers are strongly boosted in the near horizon
region relative to early observers and formation matter. In the presence of
large boosts in flat spacetime, known string and D-brane scattering processes
exhibit enhanced string production, even for large impact parameter. This
suggests the possibility that the nonadiabatic dynamics required to realize the
firewall proposal of AMPS occurs for old black holes, with the late-time
observer catalyzing the effect. After setting up this dynamical thought
experiment, we focus on a specific case: the production of open strings
stretched D-particles, at least one of which falls in late (playing the role of
a late time observer). For relatively boosted D-branes, we precisely recover
earlier results of Bachas, McAllister and Mitra which we generalize to brane
trajectories in the black hole geometry. For two classes of late-time probes,
we find a regime of significant non-adiabaticity by horizon crossing, assessing
its dependence on the boost in each case. Closed string probes, as well as
additional effects in D-brane scattering, may produce other significant
non-adiabatic effects depending on the boost, something we leave for further

of the disk is low and any zonal flows that are present are weak. For net
fields strong enough to yield observed protostellar accretion rates, however,
zonal flows with a density amplitude of 10-20% are formed. These strengths are
comparable to those seen in simulations of ideal MHD disk turbulence. We
investigate whether these zonal flows are able to reverse the inward radial
drift of solids, leading to prolonged and enhanced concentration as a prelude
to planetesimal formation. For commonly assumed mean surface density profiles
(surface density proportional to radius to the -1/2 power or steeper) we find
that the predicted perturbations to the background disk profile do not
correspond to local pressure maxima. This is a consequence of radial width of
the simulated zonal flows, which is larger than was assumed in prior analytic
models of particle trapping. These larger scale flows would only trap particles
for higher amplitude fluctuations than observed. We conclude that zonal flows

bar pattern speed weakens substantially with increasing `lambda,' until it
ceases completely. The terminal structure of bars is affected as well,
including extent and shape of their boxy/peanut bulges. The essence of this

halo facilitated by the bar. For the first time we have demonstrated that a
dark matter halo can emit and not purely absorb angular momentum. Although the
halo as a whole is not found to emit, the net transfer of angular momentum from
the disk to the halo is significantly reduced or completely eliminated. The
paradigm shift implies that the accepted view that disks serve as sources of
angular momentum and halos serve as sinks, must be revised. Halos with lambda >

of the halo masses ratio with respect to the DM case induces the decrease of
the HMF in the AGN simulation. The shallower inner density profiles of halos in
the AGN simulation witnesses that mass reduction is induced by the sudden
displacement of gas induced by thermal AGN feedback. We provide fitting

deviations in image fluxes and positions from what can be achieved with a
smooth mass distribution. So far, this method has been limited by the small
number of (radio-loud, microlensing free) systems which can be analysed for the
presence of substructure. Using the gravitational lens B1422+231, we
demonstrate that adaptive optics integral field spectroscopy can also be used
to detect dark substructures. We analyse data obtained with OSIRIS on the Keck
I Telescope, using a Bayesian method that accounts for uncertainties relating
to the point spread function and image positions in the separate exposures. The
narrow-line [OIII] fluxes measured for the lensed images are consistent with
those measured in the radio, and show a significant deviation from what would
be expected in a smooth mass distribution, consistent with the presence of a
perturbing low mass halo. Detailed lens modelling shows that image fluxes and
positions are fit significantly better when the lens is modelled as a system
containing a single perturbing subhalo in addition to the main halo, rather
than by the main halo on its own, indicating the significant detection of
substructure.The inferred mass of the subhalo depends on the subhalo mass
density profile: the 68% confidence interval for the perturber mass within 600
pc are: 8.2$^{+0.6}_{-0.8}$, 8.2$^{+0.6}_{-1}$ and 7.6$\pm0.3$
$\log_{10}$[M$_{\rm{sub}}$/M$_\odot$] respectively for a singular isothermal
sphere, a pseudo-Jaffe, and an NFW mass profile. This method can extend the
study of flux ratio anomalies to virtually all quadruply imaged quasars, and
therefore offers great potential to improve the determination of the subhalo
mass function in the near future.

sources of ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrinos. The internal shock model of GRB
emission posits the joint production of UHE cosmic ray (UHECRs, above 10^8
GeV), photons, and neutrinos, through photohadronic interactions between source
photons and magnetically-confined energetic protons, that occur when
relativistically-expanding matter shells loaded with baryons collide with one
another. While neutrino observations by IceCube have now ruled out the simplest
version of the internal shock model, we show that a revised calculation of the
emission, together with the consideration of the full photohadronic cross
section and other particle physics effects, results in a prediction of the
prompt GRB neutrino flux that still lies one order of magnitude below the
current upper bounds, as recently exemplified by the results from ANTARES. In
addition, we show that by allowing protons to directly escape their magnetic
confinement without interacting at the source, we are able to partially
decouple the cosmic ray and prompt neutrino emission, which grants the freedom
to fit the UHECR observations while respecting the neutrino upper bounds.
Finally, we briefly present advances towards pinning down the precise relation
between UHECRs and UHE neutrinos, including the baryonic loading required to
fit UHECR observations, and we will assess the role that very large volume
neutrino telescopes play in this.

21cm continuum emission. We determine the stability level of each disk
probabilistically using a Bayesian analysis of our data and a simple dynamical

parameter of Q_RW = 2.0 +/- 0.9. We also find that the disk-averaged

disk-averaged gas and stellar mass surface densities (Sigma_e,g and Sigma_e,*)

is quite common in real life settings. It appears in a variety of fields:
finance, gene expression, neuroscience, crowds and collective movements are but
a limited list of examples. Mining such patterns not only helps in
understanding the relationship between objects in the domain, but assists in
forecasting their future behavior. For most interesting variants of this
problem, finding an optimal fuzzy lagged co-cluster is an NP-complete problem.
We thus present a polynomial-time Monte-Carlo approximation algorithm for
mining fuzzy lagged co-clusters. We prove that for any data matrix, the
algorithm mines a fuzzy lagged co-cluster with fixed probability, which
encompasses the optimal fuzzy lagged co-cluster by a maximum 2 ratio columns
overhead and completely no rows overhead. Moreover, the algorithm handles
noise, anti-correlations, missing values and overlapping patterns. The
algorithm was extensively evaluated using both artificial and real datasets.
The results not only corroborate the ability of the algorithm to efficiently
mine relevant and accurate fuzzy lagged co-clusters, but also illustrate the
importance of including the fuzziness in the lagged-pattern model.

forward in time a previous estimate of the structures via a new deformation
estimation scheme that is motivated by physical constraints of fluid motion.
The method employs within structure motion estimation (so that differing
motions among different structures are not mixed) while simultaneously
satisfying the physical constraint in fluid motion that at the interface
between a fluid and a medium, the normal component of the fluid's motion must
match the normal component of the motion of the medium. We show how to estimate
the motion according to the previous considerations in a variational framework,
and in particular, show that these conditions lead to PDEs with boundary
conditions at the interface that resemble Robin boundary conditions and induce
coupling between structures. We illustrate the use of this motion estimation
scheme in propagating a segmentation across frames and show that it leads to
more accurate segmentation than traditional motion estimation that does not
make use of physical constraints. Further, the method is naturally suited to
interactive segmentation methods, which are prominently used in practice in
commercial applications for cardiac analysis, where typically a segmentation
from the previous frame is used to predict a segmentation in the next frame. We
show that our propagation scheme reduces the amount of user interaction by
predicting more accurate segmentations than commonly used and recent
interactive commercial techniques.

metallicities indicate that the gas out of which the stars formed was enriched
in each case by at most a few, and potentially only one low-energy, supernova.
Such supernovae yield large quantities of light elements such as carbon but
very little iron. The dominance of low-energy supernovae is surprising, because
it has been expected that the first stars were extremely massive, and that they
disintegrated in pair-instability explosions that would rapidly enrich galaxies
in iron. What has remained unclear is the yield of iron from the first
supernovae, because hitherto no star is unambiguously interpreted as
encapsulating the yield of a single supernova. Here we report the optical
spectrum of SMSS J031300.36- 670839.3, which shows no evidence of iron (with an
upper limit of 10^-7.1 times solar abundance). Based on a comparison of its
abundance pattern with those of models, we conclude that the star was seeded
with material from a single supernova with an original mass of ~60 Mo (and that
the supernova left behind a black hole). Taken together with the previously
mentioned low-metallicity stars, we conclude that low-energy supernovae were
common in the early Universe, and that such supernovae yield light element
enrichment with insignificant iron. Reduced stellar feedback both chemically
and mechanically from low-energy supernovae would have enabled first-generation
stars to form over an extended period. We speculate that such stars may perhaps
have had an important role in the epoch of cosmic reionization and the chemical
evolution of early galaxies.

dealt with the mode coupling in the commonly discussed sense, here we study
changes in the initial waveform due to interaction of the initial driver
Alfv\'en wave and the plasma inhomogeneity, which are implicitly present in the
equations, but were not elaborated in Kaghashvili [1999]. Using a cold plasma
approximation, we show how high frequency waves (higher than the initial driver
Alfv\'en wave frequency) are generated in the inhomogeneous solar plasma flow.
The generation of the high frequency forward and backward propagating modified
fast magnetosonic/whistler waves as well as the generation of the driven
Alfv\'en waves is discussed in the solar atmosphere. The generated high
frequency waves have a shorter dissipation timescale, and they can also
resonant interact with particles using both the normal cyclotron and anomalous
cyclotron interaction channels. These waves can also be important in space,
Earths magnetosphere, the ionosphere, and laboratory plasma processes.

where the components of the unknown vector are integer-valued, arise in a wide
range of applications. In many scenarios the unknown vector is sparse, i.e., a
large fraction of its entries are zero. Examples include applications in
wireless communications, digital fingerprinting, and array-comparative genomic
hybridization systems. Sphere decoding, commonly used for solving integer
least-squares problems, can utilize the knowledge about sparsity of the unknown
vector to perform computationally efficient search for the solution. In this
paper, we formulate and analyze the sparsity-aware sphere decoding algorithm
that imposes $\ell_0$-norm constraint on the admissible solution. Analytical
expressions for the expected complexity of the algorithm for alphabets typical
of sparse channel estimation and source allocation applications are derived and
validated through extensive simulations. The results demonstrate superior
performance and speed of sparsity-aware sphere decoder compared to the
conventional sparsity-unaware sphere decoding algorithm. Moreover, variance of
the complexity of the sparsity-aware sphere decoding algorithm for binary
alphabets is derived. The search space of the proposed algorithm can be further
reduced by imposing lower bounds on the value of the objective function. The
algorithm is modified to allow for such a lower bounding technique and
simulations illustrating efficacy of the method are presented. Performance of
the algorithm is demonstrated in an application to sparse channel estimation,
where it is shown that sparsity-aware sphere decoder performs close to
theoretical lower limits.

structure, we have constructed a ligand-elastic-network description for this
protein and investigated ATP-induced conformational motions in structurally
resolved computer experiments. As we found, interactions with nucleotides
resulted in generic motions which are functional and robust. Upon binding of
ATP-mimicking ligands the structure changed from a conformation in which the
nucleotide-binding domains formed an open shape, to a conformation in which
they were found in tight contact and the transmembrane domains were rotated.
The heme channel was broadened in the ligand-bound complex and the gate to the
cytoplasm, which was closed in the nucleotide-free conformation, was rendered
open by a mechanism that involved tilting motions of essential transmembrane
helices. Based on our findings we propose that the HmuUV transporter behaves
like a `simple' mechanical device in which, induced by binding of ATP ligands,
linear motions of the nucleotide-binding domains are translated into rotational
motions and internal tilting dynamics of the transmembrane domains that control
gating inside the heme pathway.

manner complementary to laboratory experiments, such as the celebrated lunar

attained campaign status, following planning by a Dark Energy Task Force in
2005. In this paper we employ the full SNIa dataset to the end of 2013 to set a
limit on G variation. In our approach we adopt the standard candle delineation
of the redshift distance relation. We set an upper limit on its rate of change
|G dot / G| of 0.1 parts per billion per year over 9 Gyrs. By contrast lunar
laser ranging tests variation of G over the last few decades. Conversely, one
may adopt the laboratory result as a prior and constrain the effect of variable
G in dark energy equation of state experiments to delta w < 0.02. We also
examine the parameterization G ~ 1 + z. Its short expansion age conflicts with
the measured values of the expansion rate and the density in a flat Universe.
In conclusion, supernova cosmology complements other experiments in limiting G
variation. An important caveat is that it rests on the assumption that the same
mass of 56Ni is burned to create the standard candle regardless of redshift.
These two quantities, f and G, where f is the Chandrasekhar mass fraction
burned, are degenerate. Constraining f variation alone requires more
understanding of the SNIa mechanism.

measurement, {\gamma}-ray peak identification is usually difficult due to the
short measurement time that results in a lower {\gamma}-ray energy produced by
the decay. Consequently, the resulting significant scattering in the low-energy
side leads to strong statistical fluctuations and low detection efficiency that
overwhelm the {\gamma}-ray peak. Here, we propose the use of shift invariance
wavelet algorithm for low-energy part of the spectrum for weak {\gamma}-ray
peak smoothing. The proposed algorithm not only overcomes the pseudo-Gibbs in
the high-resolution {\gamma}-ray spectrum de-noising by the traditional wavelet
transform, but also keeps quality of the weak {\gamma}-ray characteristic peak
as well. Our new approach shows a significantly improved performance of the

in Lupus, Sz 91, we have performed aperture synthesis 345 GHz continuum and
CO(3--2) observations with the Submillimeter Array ($\sim1\arcsec$--3$\arcsec$
resolution), and high-resolution imaging of polarized intensity at the
$K_s$-band by using the HiCIAO instrument on the Subaru Telescope ($0\farcs25$
resolution). Our observations successfully resolved the inner and outer radii
of the dust disk to be 65 AU and 170 AU, respectively, which indicates that Sz
91 is a transition disk source with one of the largest known inner holes. The
model fitting analysis of the spectral energy distribution reveals an H$_2$
mass of $2.4\times10^{-3}$ $M_\sun$ in the cold ($T<$30 K) outer part at
$65<r<170$ AU by assuming a canonical gas-to-dust mass ratio of 100, although a
small amount ($>3\times10^{-9}$ $M_\sun$) of hot ($T\sim$180 K) dust possibly
remains inside the inner hole of the disk. The structure of the hot component
could be interpreted as either an unresolved self-luminous companion body (not
directly detected in our observations) or a narrow ring inside the inner hole.
Significant CO(3--2) emission with a velocity gradient along the major axis of
the dust disk is concentrated on the Sz 91 position, suggesting a rotating gas
disk with a radius of 420 AU. The Sz 91 disk is possibly a rare disk in an
evolutionary stage immediately after the formation of protoplanets because of
the large inner hole and the lower disk mass than other transition disks
studied thus far.

characteristics of games of strategy, games of optimal strategy and tactical

outcome of a game of strategy, in some cases, depends on chance. All other
events depend on the free decision of the players. A game has a solution if
there exist two strategies, which become optimal strategies when each

tactical problem for a class of games can be mathematically modeled as a combat

of the firing machinery and the total amount of ammunition that each plane
carries. This silent duel occurs, because each MOP bomber is unable to
determine the number of times its opponent has missed. The TOSG Protocol
realizes a game theory solution of the tactical optimal strategy game utilizing

these pulsars, a sharp increase in the emission is observed that then tends to
systematically drop-off from pulse-to-pulse. In this paper we describe the
discovery of such a relationship in high-sensitivity observations of the young
(characteristic age of 90,000 yrs) 0.33 s pulsar B0611+22 at both 327 MHz and
1400 MHz with the Arecibo radio telescope. While Nowakowski previously showed
that B0611+22 has mode-switching properties, the data presented here show, for
the first time, that this pulsar emits bursts with characteristic time-scales
of several hundred seconds. At 327 MHz, the pulsar shows steady behaviour in
one emission mode which is enhanced by bursting emission slightly offset in
pulse phase from this steady emission. Contrastingly at 1400 MHz, the two modes
appear to behave in a competing operation while still offset in phase. Using a
fluctuation spectrum analysis, we also investigate each mode independently for
sub-pulse drifting. Neither emission mode (i.e. during bursts or persistent
emission) shows the presence of the drifting sub-pulse phenomenon. The bursting
phenomena seen here appears to be a hybrid between bursting seen in other
pulsars and the bistable profile illumination behaviour reported in two other
pulsars by Rankin et al. Further examples of this cross-frequency behaviour are
required, as this phenomenon may be quite common among the pulsar population.

successive interference cancellation (SIC) in wireless networks with arbitrary
fading distribution and power-law path loss. An analytical characterization of
the performance of SIC is given as a function of different system parameters.
The results suggest that the marginal benefit of enabling the receiver to
successively decode k users diminishes very fast with k, especially in networks
of high dimensions and small path loss exponent. On the other hand, SIC is
highly beneficial when the users are clustered around the receiver and/or very
low-rate codes are used. Also, with multiple packet reception, a lower per-user
information rate always results in higher aggregate throughput in
interference-limited networks. In contrast, there exists a positive optimal
per-user rate that maximizes the aggregate throughput in noisy networks.
  The analytical results serve as useful tools to understand the potential gain
of SIC in heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs). Using these tools, this paper
quantifies the gain of SIC on the coverage probability in HCNs with
non-accessible base stations. An interesting observation is that, for
contemporary narrow-band systems (e.g., LTE and WiFi), most of the gain of SIC
is achieved by canceling a single interferer.

$S\sigma$ and $\kappa\sigma^{2}$ with the expectations from Poisson and
negative binomial distributions (NBD). The $S\sigma$ values deviate from
Poisson and are close to NBD baseline, while the $\kappa\sigma^{2}$ values tend
to lie between the two. Within the present uncertainties, our data do not show
non-monotonic behavior as a function of collision energy. These measurements
provide a distinct way of determining the freeze-out parameters in heavy-ion
collisions by comparing with theoretical models.

important in the quiet solar chromosphere, given its strong dynamism and
reduced magnetic field intensity. Our investigation focused in the solution of
the multilevel, non-LTE radiative problem of the generation and transfer of
polarized radiation in increasingly realistic atmosphere models

ad-hoc velocities, hydrodynamical time-dependent models and a snapshot of a 3D

particular result, we obtained the first synthetic tomography of a model quiet

effect and of circular polarization dominated by the Zeeman effect. We also
studied the relevance of dynamic and thermodynamic in the inference of the
chromospheric magnetic field orientation taking into account the 90{\deg} and
180{\deg} ambiguities and showing how velocity and temperature gradients can
affect the diagnostic process. We show that Solar-C and the European Solar

are able to modulate the resulting scattering polarization amplitudes,

some cases, while in some other cases oscillatory behavior appears, which
generalizes classical results for orthogonal polynomials due to Karlin and
Szeg\H{o}. There are two applications of our results. The first application
arises from the observation that the $m$-th moment of the average
characteristic polynomials for multiple orthogonal polynomial ensembles can be
expressed as a Wronskian of the type II multiple orthogonal polynomials. Hence,
it is straightforward to obtain the distinct behavior of the moments for odd
and even $m$ in a special multiple orthogonal ensemble - the AT ensemble. As
the second application, we derive some Tur\'an type inequalities for multiple
Hermite and multiple Laguerre polynomials (of two kinds). Finally, we study
numerically the geometric configuration of zeros for the Wronskians of these
multiple orthogonal polynomials. We observe that the zeros have regular
configurations in the complex plane, which might be of independent interest.

cases diffusion is a non-Poisson process, and hopping is strongly correlated in
time. In B1 the diffusion coefficient can be approximated by an Arrhenius
expression, though the physical significance of the parameters differs from
that commonly assumed. In low temperature B3 and B4 diffusion is characterised
by concerted motion of multiple ions in short closed loops. Diffusion
coefficients can not be expressed in a simple Arrhenius form dependent on
single-ion free-energies, and intrinsic diffusion must be considered a
many-body process.

the surface gravity to derive near-infrared spectral types. Finally, we found
the best fit between each spectrum and synthetic spectra from the BT-Settl 2010

the objects and identify which spectral characteristics the models do not
reproduce. We confirmed that our objects are young BD and we found NIR spectral
types in agreement with the ones determined at optical wavelengths. The
spectrum of the L2-gamma dwarf 2MASSJ2322-6151 reproduces well the spectrum of
the planetary mass companion 1RXS J1609-2105b. BT-Settl models fit the spectra
and the 1-5 $\mu$m SED of the L0-L3 dwarfs for temperatures between 1600-2000
K. But the models fail to reproduce the shape of the H band, and the NIR slope
of some of our targets. This fact, and the best fit solutions found with
super-solar metallicity are indicative of a lack of dust, in particular at high
altitude, in the cloud models. The modeling of the vertical mixing and of the
grain growth will be revised in the next version of the BT-Settl models. These

for dispersive and non-dispersive evolution equations based on ideas of
comparison principle and canonical transforms. For operators $a(D_x)$ of order
$m$ satisfying the dispersiveness condition $\nabla a(\xi)\neq0$, a range of
smoothing estimates is established. Especially, time-global smoothing estimates
for the operator $a(D_x)$ with lower order terms are the benefit of our new
method. These estimates are known to fail for general non-dispersive operators.
For the case when the dispersiveness breaks, we suggest a modification of the
smoothing estimate. It is equivalent to the usual estimate in the dispersive
case and is also invariant under canonical transformations for the operator
$a(D_x)$. Moreover, it does continue to hold for a variety of non-dispersive
operators $a(D_x)$, where $\nabla a(\xi)$ may become zero on some set. It is
interesting that this method allows us to carry out a global microlocal
reduction of equations to the translation invariance property of the Lebesgue
measure.

analysis technique, which produced temperature maps using observations of the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board Solar Dynamic Observatory. The average
temperature of the flux rope steadily increased from ~ 5 MK to ~ 10 MK during
the first nine minutes of the evolution, which was much longer than the rise
time (about three minutes) of the associated soft X-ray flare. We suggest that
the flux rope be heated by the energy release of the continuing magnetic
reconnection, different from the heating of the low-lying flare loops, which is
mainly produced by the chromospheric plasma evaporation. The loop arcade
overlying the flux rope was pushed up by ~ 10 Mm during the attempted eruption.
The pattern of the velocity variation of the loop arcade strongly suggests that
the failure of the eruption be caused by the strapping effect of the overlying
loop arcade.

based on resonant wave-wave interaction theory, i.e. we assume that, in the
weakly nonlinear regime (the one in which Fermi was originally interested), the
large time dynamics is ruled by exact resonances. After a detailed analysis of
the $\alpha$-FPU equation of motion, we find that the first non trivial
resonances correspond to six-wave interactions. Those are precisely the
interactions responsible for the thermalization of the energy in the spectrum.
We predict that for small amplitude random waves the time scale of such
interactions is extremely large and it is of the order of $1/\epsilon^8$, where
$\epsilon$ is the small parameter in the system. The wave-wave interaction
theory is not based on any threshold: equipartition is predicted for arbitrary
small nonlinearity. Our results are supported by extensive numerical
simulations. A key role in our finding is played by the {\it Umklapp} (flip
over) resonant interactions, typical of discrete systems. The thermodynamic
limit is also briefly discussed.

scattering transform, decomposes a periodic signal into nonlinearly interacting
waves. In contrast to the common Fourier transform, these waves no longer have
to be sinusoidal. Physically relevant waveforms are often available for the
analysis instead. The details of the transform depend on the waveforms
underlying the analysis, which in turn are specified through the implicit
assumption that the signal is governed by a certain evolution equation. For
example, water waves generated by the Korteweg-de Vries equation can be
expressed in terms of cnoidal waves. Light waves in optical fiber governed by
the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation (NSE) are another example. Nonlinear
analogs of classic problems such as spectral analysis and filtering arise in
many applications, with information transmission in optical fiber, as proposed
by Yousefi and Kschischang, being a very recent one. The nonlinear Fourier
transform is eminently suited to address them -- at least from a theoretical
point of view. Although numerical algorithms are available for computing the
transform, a ""fast"" nonlinear Fourier transform that is similarly effective as
the fast Fourier transform is for computing the common Fourier transform has
not been available so far. The goal of this paper is to address this problem.
Two fast numerical methods for computing the nonlinear Fourier transform with
respect to the NSE are presented. The first method achieves a runtime of
$O(D^2)$ floating point operations, where $D$ is the number of sample points.
The second method applies only to the case where the NSE is defocusing, but it
achieves an $O(D\log^2D)$ runtime. Extensions of the results to other evolution
equations are discussed as well.

maximum DoF of $2N$ is achievable when $N \leq \lfloor\frac{8M}{5}\rfloor$ by
applying signal alignment (SA) for network coding and interference cancelation.
This work considers the case $N>2M$ where the performance is limited by the
number of antennas at each source node and conventional SA is not feasible. We
propose a \textit{generalized signal alignment} (GSA) based transmission
scheme. The key is to let the signals to be exchanged between every source node
align in a transformed subspace, rather than the direct subspace, at the relay
so as to form network-coded signals. This is realized by jointly designing the
precoding matrices at all source nodes and the processing matrix at the relay.
Moreover, the aligned subspaces are orthogonal to each other. By applying the
GSA, we show that the DoF upper bound $4M$ is achievable when $M \leq
\lfloor\frac{2N}{5}\rfloor$ ($M$ is even) or $M \leq

applications due to their large dielectric permittivity (e') values of up to
300 000. The underlying mechanism for the high e' is an internal barrier layer
capacitor (IBLC) structure of insulating grain boundaries (GB) and conducting
grain interiors (bulk). This behaviour is reviewed and discussed in detail. The
origin of the IBLC structure is attributed to a small Cu non-stoichiometry in
nominally insulating CaCu3Ti4O12, which varies between the GBs and bulk. Such
non-stoichiometry effects are studied in detail by analyzing bulk ceramics of
different composition within the ternary CaO-CuO-TiO2 phase diagram using X-ray
diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and impedance
spectroscopy (IS). At least two defect mechanisms are suggested to exist. It is
further shown that the development of the defect mechanisms in CCTO and the
concomitant formation of the IBLC structure strongly depend on the processing
conditions of CCTO ceramic pellets such as the sintering temperature. Nominally
stoichiometric CCTO bulk ceramics sintered at different temperatures are
analyzed using XRD, SEM and IS. The performance of CCTO ceramics for IBLC
applications is controlled by subtle modifications in the compound
stoichiometry that is strongly dependent on the ceramic sintering temperature.

elements of Schwarzschild's technique and of the made-to-measure method, but is
based on a different principle. Starting with some initial assignment of
particle velocities, we calculate their orbits using a flexible tree-based
force algorithm in the stationary potential of the target density distribution.
The difference of the time-averaged density response produced by these orbits
with respect to the initial density configuration is characterized through a
merit function, and a stationary solution of the collisionless Boltzmann
equation is found by minimizing this merit function directly by iteratively
adjusting the initial velocities. Because the distribution function is in
general not unique for a given density structure, we augment the merit function
with additional constraints that single out a desired target solution. We do
this for broad classes of axisymmetric density distributions by numerically
solving the Jeans equations to obtain the second velocity moments, which are
then imposed as further constraints in the optimization process. The velocity
adjustment is carried out with a stochastic process in which new velocities are
randomly drawn from an approximate solution of the distribution function, but
are kept only when they improve the fit. Our method converges rapidly and is
flexible enough to allow the construction of solutions with third integrals of
motion, including disk galaxies with realistic velocity distributions. We
demonstrate that the new method reproduces analytic distribution functions
where they are known (such as the Hernquist sphere), and that it yields very
stable N-body realizations for a variety of examples of compound galaxy models,
considerably improving on widely used moment-based approaches.

events of any kind, these are attributes that social media like Twitter share
with foreign exchange markets. The leading assumption of this paper is that
information which can be distilled from public debates on Twitter has
predictive content for exchange rate movements. This assumption prompted a
Twitter-based exchange rate model that harnesses regARIMA analyses for
short-term out-of-sample ex post forecasts of the daily closing prices of
EUR/USD spot exchange rates. The analyses used Tweet counts collected from
January 1, 2012 - September 27, 2013. To identify concepts mentioned on Twitter
with a predictive potential the analysis followed a 2-step selection. Firstly,
a heuristic qualitative analysis assembled a long list of 594 concepts, e.g.,
Merkel, Greece, Cyprus, crisis, chaos, growth, unemployment expected to covary
with the ups and downs of the EUR/USD exchange rate. Secondly, cross-validation
using window averaging with a fixed-sized rolling origin was deployed to select
concepts and corresponding univariate time series that had error scores below
chance level as defined by the random walk model. With regard to a short list
of 17 concepts (covariates), in particular SP (Standard & Poor's) and risk, the
out-of-sample predictive accuracy of the Twitter-based regARIMA model was found
to be repeatedly better than that obtained from both the random walk model and
a random noise covariate in 1-step ahead forecasts of the EUR/USD exchange
rate. This advantage was evident on the level of forecast error metrics (MSFE,
MAE) when a majority vote over different estimation windows was conducted. The
results challenge the semi-strong form of the efficient market hypothesis
(Fama, 1970, 1991) which when applied to the FX market maintains that all
publicly available information is already integrated into exchange rates.

excessive surface twisting as a rotation angle about a specified axis, i.e.
quantification of surface torsion. At first we experimented three ellipse

(so-called ""coreshine"") reveals the presence of grains around 1 $\mu$m, which
is larger than the grains found in the low-density interstellar medium. But
only about half of the 100+ cores investigated so far show the effect. This
prompts further studies on the origin of this detection rate. From the 3D
continuum radiative transfer equation, we derive the expected scattered light
intensity from a core placed in an arbitrary direction seen from Earth. We use
the approximation of single scattering, consider extinction up to 2nd-order
Taylor approximation, and neglect spatial gradients in the dust size
distribution. The impact of the directional characteristics of the scattering
on the detection of scattered light from cores is calculated for a given grain
size distribution, and local effects like additional radiation field components
are discussed. The surface brightness profiles of a core with a 1D density
profile are calculated for various Galactic locations, and the results are
compared to the approximate detection limits. We find that for optically thin
radiation and a constant size distribution, a simple limit for detecting
scattered light from a low-mass core can be derived that holds for grains with
sizes smaller than 0.5 $\mu$m. The extinction by the core prohibits detection
in bright parts of the Galactic plane, especially near the Galactic center. For
scattered light received from low-mass cores with grain sizes beyond 0.5
$\mu$m, the directional characteristics of the scattering favors the detection
of scattered light above and below the Galactic center, and to some extent near
the Galactic anti-center. We identify the local incident radiation field as the
major unknown causing deviations from this simple scheme.

common in traffic planning. It is common sense that vehicular traffic arranges
in a user-equilibrium based on generalized costs in which travel time is a
major factor. Surprisingly travel time has not received much attention for the
route choice of pedestrians. In microscopic simulations of pedestrians the
vastly dominating paradigm for the computation of the preferred walking
direction is set into the direction of the (spatially) shortest path. For
situations where pedestrians have travel time as primary determinant for their
walking behavior it would be desirable to also have an assignment method in
pedestrian simulations. To apply existing (road traffic) assignment methods
with simulations of pedestrians one has to reduce the nondenumerably many
possible pedestrian trajectories to a small subset of routes which represent
the main, relevant, and significantly distinguished routing alternatives. All
except one of these routes will mark detours, i.e. not the shortest connection
between origin and destination. The proposed assignment method is intended to
work with common operational models of pedestrian dynamics. These - as
mentioned before - usually send pedestrians into the direction of the spatially
shortest path. Thus, all detouring routes have to be equipped with intermediate
destinations, such that pedestrians can do a detour as a piecewise connection
of segments on which they walk into the direction of the shortest path. One has
then to take care that the transgression from one segment to the following one
no artifacts are introduced into the pedestrian trajectory.

there is that, in contrast to periodic geometries, finite-size scaling is

embryos, many of these impactors already differentiated, with metallic cores of
their own. Geochemical data provide critical information on the timing of
accretion and the prevailing physical conditions, but their interpretation
depends critically on the degree of metal-silicate chemical equilibration
during core-mantle differentiation, which is poorly constrained. Efficient
equilibration requires that the large volumes of iron derived from impactor
cores mix with molten silicates down to scales small enough to allow fast
metal-silicate mass transfer. Here we use fluid dynamics experiments to show
that large metal blobs falling in a magma ocean mix with the molten silicate
through turbulent entrainment, with fragmentation into droplets eventually
resulting from the entrainment process. In our experiments, fragmentation of
the dense fluid occurs after falling a distance equal to 3-4 times its initial
diameter, at which point a sizable volume of ambient fluid has already been
entrained and mixed with the dense falling fluid. Contrary to what has usually
been assumed, we demonstrate that fragmentation of the metallic phase into
droplets may not be required for efficient equilibration: turbulent mixing, by
drastically increasing the metal-silicate interfacial area, may result in fast
equilibration even before fragmentation. Efficient re-equilibration is
predicted for impactors of size small compared to the magma ocean depth. In
contrast, a much smaller re-equilibration degree is predicted in the case of
large impacts for which the impactor core diameter approaches the magma ocean

polynomials. We prove a vast, qualitative, generalisation of this fact to what
we call Pl\""ucker varieties. A Pl\""ucker variety is in fact a family of
varieties in exterior powers of vector spaces that, like the Grassmannian, is
functorial in the vector space and behaves well under duals. A special case of
our result says that for each fixed natural number k, the k-th secant variety
of any Pl\""ucker-embedded Grassmannian is defined in bounded degree independent
of the Grassmannian. Our approach is to take the limit of a Pl\""ucker variety
in the dual of a highly symmetric space known as the infinite wedge, and to
prove that up to symmetry the limit is defined by finitely many polynomial
equations. For this we prove the auxilliary result that for every natural
number p the space of p-tuples of infinite-by-infinite matrices is Noetherian
modulo row and column operations. Our results have algorithmic counterparts:
every bounded Pl\""ucker variety has a polynomial-time membership test, and the
same holds for Zariski-closed, basis-independent properties of p-tuples of
matrices.

signatures of anisotropic expansion in the Universe. We focus on Union2 and
SNLS3 SNIa datasets and use the hemispherical comparison method to detect
possible anisotropic features. Unlike some previous works where non-diagonal
elements of the covariance matrix were neglected, we use the full covariance
matrix of the SNIa data, thus obtaining more realistic and not underestimated
errors. As a matter of fact, the significance of previously claimed detections
of a preferred direction in the Union2 dataset completely disappears once we
include the effects of using the full covariance matrix. Moreover, we also find
that such a a preferred direction is aligned with the orthogonal direction of
the SDSS observational plane and this suggests a clear indication that the SDSS
subsample of the Union2 dataset introduces a significant biased, making the
detected preferred direction unphysical. We thus find that current SNIa surveys
are inappropriate to test anisotropic features due to their highly
non-homogeneous angular distribution in the sky. In addition, after removal of
the highest inhomogeneous sub-samples, the number of SNIa is too low. Finally,
we take advantage of the particular distribution of SNLS SNIa sub-sample in the
SNLS3 data set, in which the observations were taken along 4 different
directions. We fit each direction independently and find consistent results at
the 1$\sigma$ level. Although the likelihoods peak at relatively different
values of $\Omega_m$,the low number of data along each direction gives rise to
large errors so that the likelihoods are sufficiently broad as to overlap
within 1$\sigma$.

We prove the existence of a plethora of equilibria, corresponding to
symmetry-breaking solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations, via global
bifurcation from the spherical state. To the best of our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous existence results for this class of problems. We
overcome several difficulties in carrying this out. Due to inherent in-plane
fluidity combined with finite curvature elasticity, neither the Eulerian
(spatial) nor the Lagrangian (material) description of the model lends itself
well to analysis. Instead we adopt a singularity-free radial-map description
that effectively eliminates the grossly underdetermined in-plane fluid
deformation. The resulting governing equations comprise a quasi-linear elliptic
system with lower-order nonlinear constraints. We then show the equivalence of
our problem to that of finding the zeros of compact vector field. The latter is
not routine; we obtain certain spectral estimates and then shift the principle
part of the operator. With this in hand, we combine well known group-theoretic
ideas for symmetry-breaking with global bifurcation theory to obtain our
results.

different vacuum states of the same theory. In the region outside the sphere,
the contributions in the VEVs, induced by the interior geometry, are explicitly

asymptotics of the VEVs near the boundary and at large distances are discussed
in detail. In particular, it has been shown that the divergences on the
boundary are weaker than in the problem of a spherical boundary in Minkowski
spacetime with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. As an application of
general results, dS and AdS spaces are considered as examples of the interior
geometry. For AdS interior there are no bound states. In the case of dS
geometry and for nonminimally coupled fields, bound states appear for a radius
of the separating boundary sufficiently close to the dS horizon. Starting from
a critical value of the radius the Minkowskian vacuum in the exterior region
becomes unstable. For small values of the AdS curvature radius, to the leading
order, the VEVs in the exterior region coincide with those for a spherical
boundary in Minkowski spacetime with Dirichlet boundary condition. The
exceptions are the cases of minimal and conformal couplings: for a minimal
coupling the VEVs are reduced to the case with Neumann boundary condition,
