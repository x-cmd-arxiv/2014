$A,B$ on a Hilbert space $H$ are unitarily equivalent modulo compacts, i.e.,
$uAu^*+K=B$ for some unitary $u\in \mathcal{U}(H)$ and compact self-adjoint
operator $K$, if and only if $A$ and $B$ have the same essential spectra:
$\sigma_{\rm{ess}}(A)=\sigma_{\rm{ess}}(B)$. In this paper we consider to what
extent the above Weyl-von Neumann's result can(not) be extended to unbounded
operators using descriptive set theory. We show that if $H$ is separable
infinite-dimensional, this equivalence relation for bounded self-adjoin
operators is smooth, while the same equivalence relation for general
self-adjoint operators contains a dense $G_{\delta}$-orbit but does not admit
classification by countable structures. On the other hand, apparently related
equivalence relation $A\sim B\Leftrightarrow \exists u\in \mathcal{U}(H)\
[u(A-i)^{-1}u^*-(B-i)^{-1}$ is compact], is shown to be smooth. Various Borel
or co-analytic equivalence relations related to self-adjoint operators are also
presented.

confirm. Observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu \beta \beta$), a
spontaneous transition that may occur in several candidate nuclei, would verify
the Majorana nature of the neutrino and constrain the absolute scale of the
neutrino mass spectrum. Recent searches carried out with $^{76}$Ge (GERDA
experiment) and $^{136}$Xe (KamLAND-Zen and EXO-200 experiments) have
established the lifetime of this decay to be longer than $10^{25}$ yr,
corresponding to a limit on the neutrino mass of 0.2-0.4 eV. Here we report new
results from EXO-200 based on 100 kg$\cdot$yr of $^{136}$Xe exposure,
representing an almost fourfold increase from our earlier published datasets.
We have improved the detector resolution at the $^{136}$Xe double-beta-decay
Q-value to $\sigma$/E = 1.53% and revised the data analysis. The obtained
half-life sensitivity is $1.9\cdot10^{25}$ yr, an improvement by a factor of

evidence for $0\nu \beta \beta$ decay and set a half-life limit of
$1.1\cdot10^{25}$ yr at 90% CL. The high sensitivity holds promise for further
running of the EXO-200 detector and future $0\nu \beta \beta$ decay searches

by comparing the Thorpe scale to the Ozmidov scale. In both cases, the
turbulence dissipation rate can be estimated using single vertical profiles
from shipborne instrumentation. We present here an alternative method to
estimate the length scale of overturns by using the Ellison length scale. The
Ellison scale is estimated from temperature variance just beyond the internal
wave band, measured by moored instruments. We apply the method to high
resolution temperature data from two moorings deployed at different locations
around the Josephine seamount (North Eastern Atlantic Ocean), in a region of
bottom-intensified turbulence. The variance of the temperature time series just
above the internal wave frequency band is well correlated with the Thorpe
scale. The method is based on the time--frequency decomposition of variance
called ""maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform"". The results show that the
Ellison length scale can be a viable alternative to the Thorpe scale for
indirectly estimating turbulence dissipation rate from moored instruments in
the ocean if time resolution is sufficiently high. We suggest that fine
structure contaminated temperature measurements can provide reliable
information on turbulence intensity.

interest are distinguished. (1) Several new examples of the earliest spectral
types O2-O3 have been found. (2) A group of extremely rapidly rotating
main-sequence objects has been isolated, including the largest $v\sin i$ values
known, the spatial and radial-velocity distributions of which suggest ejection
from the two principal ionizing clusters. (3) Several new examples of the
evolved, rapidly rotating Onfp class show similar evidence. (4) No fewer than
48 members of the Vz category, hypothesized to be on or near the ZAMS, are
found in this sample; in contrast to the rapid rotators, they are strongly
concentrated to the ionizing clusters, supporting their interpretation as very
young objects, as do their relatively faint absolute magnitudes. (5) A
surprisingly large fraction of the main-sequence spectra belong to the recently
recognized V((fc)) class, with C III emission lines of similar strength to the
usual N III in V((f)) spectra; there are also six objects with very
high-quality data but no trace of either mission feature, presenting new
challenges to physical interpretations. (6) Five spectra with morphologically
enhanced nitrogen lines have been detected. Absolute visual magnitudes have
been derived for each star with individual extinction laws, and composite HRDs
provide evidence of the multiple generations present in this field.
Associations with X-ray sources are noted. Further analyses of this unique
dataset underway will provide new insights into the evolution of massive stars
and starburst clusters.

the problem of scheduling traffic with such dependencies, where each packet has
a deadline by which it should arrive at its destination. Such deadlines are

  We study online algorithms for the problem of maximizing goodput of

MPEG over the years and video codecs have become integral parts of media
entertainment applications. Despite the ubiquitous use of video coding
techniques, it is interesting to note that a closed form rate-distortion
characterization for video coding is not available in the literature. In this
paper, we develop a simple, yet, fundamental characterization of
rate-distortion region in video coding based on information-theoretic first
principles. The concept of conditional motion estimation is used to derive the
closedform expression for rate-distortion region without losing its generality.
Conditional motion estimation offers an elegant means to analyze the
rate-distortion trade-offs and demonstrates the viability of achieving the
bounds derived. The concept involves classifying image regions into active and
inactive based on the amount of motion activity. By appropriately modeling the
residuals corresponding to active and inactive regions, a closed form
expression for rate-distortion function is derived in terms of motion activity
and spatio-temporal correlation that commonly exist in video content.
Experiments on real video clips using H.264 codec are presented to demonstrate
the practicality and validity of the proposed rate-distortion analysis.

electronic band structures in proximity to energy extrema in the Brillouin zone

quadratic expansions and corresponding definitions of effective masses.
Multi-dimensional expansions, however, are permissible only under strict
conditions that are typically violated by degenerate bands and even some
non-degenerate bands. Suggestive terms such as ""band warping"" or ""corrugated
energy surfaces"" have been used to refer to such situations and ad hoc methods
have been developed to treat them. While numerical calculations may reflect
such features, a complete theory of band warping has not been developed. We
develop a generally applicable theory, based on radial expansions, and a
corresponding definition of angular effective mass. Our theory also accounts
for effects of band non-parabolicity and anisotropy, which hitherto have not
been precisely distinguished from, if not utterly confused with, band warping.
Based on our theory, we develop precise procedures to evaluate band warping
quantitatively. As a benchmark demonstration, we analyze the warping features
of valence bands in silicon using first-principles calculations and we compare
those with previous semi-empirical models. We use our theory and angular
effective masses to generalize derivations of tensorial transport coefficients
for cases of either single or multiple electronic bands, with either
quadratically expansible or warped energy surfaces. From that theory we
discover the formal existence at critical points of transport-equivalent
ellipsoidal bands that yield identical results from the standpoint of any
transport property. Additionally, we illustrate the drastic effects that band
warping can induce on thermoelectric properties using multi-band models.

not coincide unless the data covariance is exactly known. For sampled data
covariances, with Gaussian distributed data and parameters, the parameter
covariance matrix estimated from the width of the likelihood has a Wishart
distribution, from which we derive the mean and covariance. This mean is biased
and we propose an unbiased estimator of the parameter covariance matrix.
Comparing our analytic results to a numerical Wishart sampler of the data
covariance matrix we find excellent agreement. An accurate ansatz for the mean
parameter covariance for the peak scatter estimator is found, and we fit its
covariance to our numerical analysis. The mean is again biased and we propose
an unbiased estimator for the peak parameter covariance. For sampled data
covariances the width estimator is more accurate than the peak scatter
estimator. We investigate modelling the data covariance, or equivalently data
compression, and shown that the peak scatter estimator is less sensitive to
biases in the model data covariance matrix than the width estimator, but
requires independent realisations of the data to reduce the statistical error.
If the model bias on the peak estimator is sufficiently low this is promising,
otherwise the sampled width estimator is preferable.

of the plasma in the limiting case of small Debye length ${\lambda}_D$. A
second-approximation asymptotic solution is found for the double layer
positioned at the boundary of the illuminated region and for the un-illuminated
plasma for the plane geometry. Numerical calculations for different values of
${\lambda}_D$ are reported and found to confirm the asymptotic results. The net
integral space charge of the double layer is asymptotically small, although in
the plane geometry it is just sufficient to shield the ambipolar electric field
existing in the illuminated region and thus to prevent it from penetrating into
the un-illuminated region. The double layer has the same mathematical nature as
the intermediate transition layer separating an active plasma and a
collisionless sheath, and the underlying physics is also the same. In essence,
the two layers represent the same physical object: a transonic layer.

Based on our knowledge, there are no numerical methods to integrate
differential equations with discontinuous right hand side of fractional order
which model these systems. Therefore, via Filippov's regularization [1] and
Cellina's Theorem [2,3], we prove that the initial value problem can be
converted into a continuous problem of fractional-order, to which numerical
methods for fractional orders apply. In this way, the synchronization problem
transforms into a standard problem for continuous systems of fractional order.
Three examples of fractional-order piece-wise systems are considered: Sprott

X-ray diffraction (for A = Pr, Sm, Eu, and Dy). In all cases, a structural and
insulator-to-metal transition was evidenced, with a critical pressure that
depends on the A-cation size. We analyze the compression mechanisms at work in
the different manganites via the pressure dependence of the lattice parameters,
the shear strain in the a-c plane, and the Raman bands associated with
out-of-phase MnO6 rotations and in-plane O2 symmetric stretching modes. Our
data show a crossover across the rare-earth series between two different kinds
of behavior. For the smallest A-cations, the compression is nearly isotropic in
the ac plane, with presumably only very slight changes of tilt angles and
Jahn-Teller distortion. As the radius of the A-cation increases, the
pressure-induced reduction of Jahn-Teller distortion becomes more pronounced
and increasingly significant as a compression mechanism, while the
pressure-induced bending of octahedra chains becomes conversely less
pronounced. We finally discuss our results in the light of the notion of
chemical pressure, and show that the analogy with hydrostatic pressure works
quite well for manganites with small A-cations but can be misleading with large
A-cations.

called marginalized corrupted features (MCF), trains robust predictors by

the particle distribution is a generalized circular law (i.e. with spherical
support but non-necessarily uniform distribution). In the classical
electrostatic external potential, there are infinitely many minimizers of the
rate function. The most likely macroscopic configuration is a disordered
distribution in which particles are uniformly distributed (for $d=2$, the

General charge-dependent confining potentials unfold this degenerate situation:
in contrast, the particle density is not uniform, and particles spontaneously
organize according to their charge. In that picture the classical electrostatic
potential appears as a transition at which order is lost. Sub-leading terms of
the energy are derived: we show that these are related to an operator,
generalizing the Coulomb renormalized energy, which incorporates the

terms: a stochastic force and a drag force proportional to the particle
velocity. The combined action of both forces attempts to model the interaction
of the mixture with a bath or surrounding fluid. The problem is studied by
means of two independent and complementary routes. First, the Enskog kinetic
equation with a Fokker-Planck term describing interactions of particles with
thermostat is derived. The ratio of kinetic temperatures $T_1/T_2$ and the
fourth-degree velocity moments $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ (which measure
non-Gaussian properties of $\varphi_i$) are explicitly determined as a function
of the mass ratio, size ratio, composition, density and coefficients of

molecular dynamics simulations of a binary granular mixture of spheres are
performed for two values of the coefficient of restitution ($\alpha=0.9$ and
0.8) and three different solid volume fractions ($\phi=0.00785$, 0.1 and 0.2).
Comparison between kinetic theory and computer simulations for the temperature
ratio shows excellent agreement, even for moderate densities and strong
dissipation. In the case of the cumulants $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, good
agreement is found for the lower densities although significant discrepancies
between theory and simulation are observed with increasing density.

However, unconstrained estimation of the HRF can yield highly unstable results
when the number of free parameters is large. We develop a method for the joint
estimation of activation and HRF using a rank constraint causing the estimated
HRF to be equal across events/conditions, yet permitting it to be different
across voxels. Model estimation leads to an optimization problem that we
propose to solve with an efficient quasi-Newton method exploiting fast gradient
computations. This model, called GLM with Rank-1 constraint (R1-GLM), can be
extended to the setting of GLM with separate designs which has been shown to
improve decoding accuracy in brain activity decoding experiments. We compare 10
different HRF modeling methods in terms of encoding and decoding score in two
different datasets. Our results show that the R1-GLM model significantly
outperforms competing methods in both encoding and decoding settings,
positioning it as an attractive method both from the points of view of accuracy

efficiency in grid wireless sensor networks (WSNs). We focus on STDMA (Spatial
Reuse TDMA)) scheduling, where a predefined cycle is repeated, and where each
node has fixed transmission opportunities during specific slots (defined by
colors). We assume a STDMA algorithm that takes advantage of the regularity of
grid topology to also provide a spatially periodic coloring (""tiling"" of the
same color pattern). In this setting, the key challenges are: 1) minimizing the
average routing delay by ordering the slots in the cycle 2) being energy
efficient. Our work follows two directions: first, the baseline performance is
evaluated when nothing specific is done and the colors are randomly ordered in
the STDMA cycle. Then, we propose a solution, ORCHID that deliberately
constructs an efficient STDMA schedule. It proceeds in two steps. In the first
step, ORCHID starts form a colored grid and builds a hierarchical routing based
on these colors. In the second step, ORCHID builds a color ordering, by
considering jointly both routing and scheduling so as to ensure that any node
will reach a sink in a single STDMA cycle. We study the performance of these
solutions by means of simulations and modeling. Results show the excellent
performance of ORCHID in terms of delays and energy compared to a shortest path
routing that uses the delay as a heuristic. We also present the adaptation of
ORCHID to general networks under the SINR interference model.

several open questions in the GRB physics, including jet composition, energy
dissipation mechanism, particle acceleration mechanism, and radiation
mechanism. Recent broad-band observations of prompt emission with Fermi sharpen
the debates in these areas, which stimulated intense theoretical investigations
invoking very different ideas. I will review these debates, and argue that the
current data suggest the following picture: A quasi-thermal spectral component
originating from the photosphere of the relativistic ejecta has been detected
in some GRBs. Even though in some cases (e.g. GRB 090902B) this component
dominates the spectrum, in most GRBs, this component either forms a
sub-dominant ""shoulder"" spectral component in the low energy spectral regime of
the more dominant ""Band"" component, or is not detectable at all. The main
""Band"" spectral component likely originates from the optically thin region due
to synchrotron radiation. The diverse magnetization in the GRB central engine
is likely the origin of the observed diverse prompt emission properties among
bursts.

quantum anomaly cancellation amounts to realizing this as the boundary of a

theory, following Nuiten and closely related to recent work by Haugseng and

The so-called cosmological constant $\Lambda$ should be an approximation,

temporary description of a true dynamical vacuum energy variable that is
evolving from the inflationary epoch to the present day. We can compare the

the effect associated to the presence of the plates, and then also their

naturally expect $\delta\Lambda\sim R\sim H^2$. A class of dynamical vacuum
models that trace such rate of change can be constructed. They are compatible

spin-driven devices with magnets and interconnects that require a new class of
transport models using generalized Fermi functions and currents, each with four
components: one for charge and three for spin. The corresponding impedance
elements are not pure numbers but $4\times4$ matrices. Starting from the
Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism in the elastic,
phase-coherent transport regime, we develop spin generalized
Landauer-B\""uttiker formulas involving such $4\times 4$ conductances, for
multi-terminal devices in the presence of Normal-Metal (NM) leads. In addition
to usual terminal conductances describing currents at the contacts, we provide
spin-transfer torque conductances describing the spin currents absorbed by
ferromagnetic (FM) regions inside the conductor, specifying both of these
currents in terms of Fermi functions at the terminals. We derive universal sum
rules and reciprocity relations that would be obeyed by such matrix
conductances. Finally, we apply our formulation to two example Hamiltonians
describing the Rashba and the Hanle effect in 2D. Our results allows the use of
pure quantum transport models as building blocks in constructing circuit models
for complex spintronic and nano-magnetic structures and devices for simulation
in SPICE-like simulators.

layers may only have small disconnected islands of connectivity. We show that
$q_c(M) \lesssim \sqrt{-\ln(1-p_c)}\,/{\sqrt{M}}$, where $p_c$ is the bond
percolation threshold of $G$, and $q_c(1) \equiv q_c$ is its site percolation

Finally, we find an intriguingly close connection between this multilayer

several planets with orbital distances smaller than that of Mercury -- quite
different from the Solar System. Because these systems may be difficult to
explain in the paradigm of core accretion and disk migration, it has been
suggested that they formed in situ within protoplanetary disks with high solid
surface densities. The strong connection between giant planet occurrence and
stellar metallicity is thought to be linked to enhanced solid surface densities
in disks around metal-rich stars, so the presence of a giant planet can be a
detectable sign of planet formation in a high solid surface density disk. I
formulate quantitative predictions for the frequency of long-period giant
planets in these in situ models of planet formation by translating the proposed
increase in disk mass into an equivalent metallicity enhancement. I rederive
the scaling of giant planet occurrence with metallicity as P_gp =
0.05_{-0.02}^{+0.02} x 10^{(2.1 +/- 0.4) [M/H]} = 0.08_{-0.03}^{+0.02} x
10^{(2.3 +/- 0.4) [Fe/H]} and show that there is significant tension between
the frequency of giant planets suggested by the minimum mass extrasolar nebula
scenario and the observational upper limits. This fact suggests that high-mass
disks alone cannot explain the observed properties of the close-in Kepler
multiplanet systems and that migration is still a necessary contributor to
their formation. More speculatively, I combine the metallicity scaling of giant
planet occurrence with recently published small planet occurrence rates to
estimate the number of Solar System analogs in the Galaxy. I find that in the
Milky Way there are perhaps 4 x 10^6 true Solar System analogs with an FGK star

Sequence""; ${\rm SFR}-M_*$) is not quite unity: specific star formation rates
$({\rm SFR}/M_*)$ are weakly-but-significantly anti-correlated with $M_*$. Here
we demonstrate that this trend may simply reflect the well-known increase in
bulge mass-fractions -- portions of a galaxy not forming stars -- with $M_*$.
Using a large set of bulge/disk decompositions and SFR estimates derived from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we show that re-normalizing SFR by disk stellar
mass $({\rm sSFR_{\rm disk}\equiv SFR}/M_{*,{\rm disk}})$ reduces the
$M_*$-dependence of SF efficiency by $\sim0.25$ dex per dex, erasing it
entirely in some subsamples. Quantitatively, we find $\log {\rm
sSFR_{disk}}-\log M_*$ to have a slope $\beta_{\rm disk}\in[-0.20,0.00]\pm0.02$
(depending on SFR estimator and Main Sequence definition) for star-forming
galaxies with $M_*\geq10^{10}M_{\odot}$ and bulge mass-fractions
$B/T\lesssim0.6$, generally consistent with a pure-disk control sample
($\beta_{\rm control}=-0.05\pm0.04$). That $\langle{\rm SFR}/M_{*,{\rm
disk}}\rangle$ is (largely) independent of host mass for star-forming disks has
strong implications for aspects of galaxy evolution inferred from any ${\rm
SFR}-M_*$ relation, including: manifestations of ""mass quenching"" (bulge
growth), factors shaping the star-forming stellar mass function (uniform $d\log
M_*/dt$ for low-mass, disk-dominated galaxies), and diversity in star formation
histories (dispersion in ${\rm SFR}(M_*,t)$). Our results emphasize the need to
treat galaxies as composite systems -- not integrated masses -- in
observational and theoretical work.

galaxies using a set of 424 spectroscopic redshifts in 9 clusters drawn from
the GCLASS survey. Dividing the galaxy population into three categories:
quiescent, star-forming, and poststarburst, we find that these populations have
distinct distributions in phase space. Most striking are the poststarburst
galaxies, which are commonly found at small clustercentric radii with high
clustercentric velocities, and appear to trace a coherent ``ring"" in phase
space. Using several zoom simulations of clusters we show that the coherent
distribution of the poststarbursts can be reasonably well-reproduced using a
simple quenching scenario. Specifically, the phase space is best reproduced if
satellite quenching occurs on a rapid timescale (0.1 < tau_{Q} < 0.5 Gyr) after
galaxies make their first passage of R ~ 0.5R_{200}, a process that takes a
total time of ~ 1 Gyr after first infall. We compare this quenching timescale
to the timescale implied by the stellar populations of the poststarburst
galaxies and find that the poststarburst spectra are well-fit by a rapid
quenching (tau_{Q} = 0.4^{+0.3}_{-0.4} Gyr) of a typical star-forming galaxy.
The similarity between the quenching timescales derived from these independent
indicators is a strong consistency check of the quenching model. Given that the
model implies satellite quenching is rapid, and occurs well within R_{200},
this would suggest that ram-pressure stripping of either the hot or cold gas
component of galaxies are the most plausible candidates for the physical
mechanism. The high cold gas consumption rates at z ~ 1 make it difficult to
determine if hot or cold gas stripping is dominant; however, measurements of
the redshift evolution of the satellite quenching timescale and location may be
capable of distinguishing between the two.

measured from the Si II 6355 spectral feature. We construct a new hierarchical
Bayesian regression model, accounting for the random effects of intrinsic
scatter, measurement error, and reddening by host galaxy dust, and implement a
Gibbs sampler and deviance information criteria to estimate the correlation.
The method is applied to the apparent colors from BVRI light curves and Si II
velocity data for 79 nearby SNe Ia. The apparent color distributions of high
(HV) and normal velocity (NV) supernovae exhibit significant discrepancies for
B-V and B-R, but not other colors. Hence, they are likely due to intrinsic
color differences originating in the B-band, rather than dust reddening. The
mean intrinsic B-V and B-R color differences between HV and NV groups are 0.06
+/- 0.02 and 0.09 +/- 0.02 mag, respectively. A linear model finds significant
slopes of -0.021 +/- 0.006 and -0.030 +/- 0.009 mag/(1000 km/s) for intrinsic
B-V and B-R colors versus velocity, respectively. Since the ejecta velocity
distribution is skewed towards high velocities, these effects imply
non-Gaussian intrinsic color distributions with skewness up to +0.3. Accounting
for the intrinsic color-velocity correlation results in corrections to A_V
extinction estimates as large as -0.12 mag for HV SNe Ia and +0.06 mag for NV
events. Velocity measurements from SN Ia spectra have potential to diminish
systematic errors from the confounding of intrinsic colors and dust reddening
affecting supernova distances.

scalar fields with $m^2>\left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^2$ in de Sitter space by
smearing over conformal field theory operators on the future/past boundary. To
maintain bulk micro-causality and recover the bulk Wightman function in the
Euclidean vacuum, the smearing prescription must involve two sets of
single--trace operators with dimensions $\Delta$ and $d-\Delta$. Thus the local
operator prescription in de Sitter space differs from the analytic continuation
from the prescription in anti--de Sitter space. Pushing a local operator in the
global patch to future/past infinity is shown to lead to an operator relation
between single--trace operators in conformal field theories at
$\mathcal{I}^\pm$, which can be interpreted as a basis transformation, also
identified as the relation between an operator in CFT and its shadow operator.
Construction of spin$-s$ gauge field operators is discussed, it is shown that
the construction of higher spin gauge fields in de Sitter space is equivalent
to constructing scalar fields with specific values of mass parameter
$m^2<\left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^2$. An acausal higher spin bulk operator which
matches onto boundary higher spin current is constructed. Implementation of the

suggestions for novel applications. However, in 3D the skyrmion crystal phase
is observed only in a narrow region of the temperature-field phase diagram. We
show here, using a general analysis based on symmetry, that skyrmions are much
more readily stabilized in two-dimensional (2D) systems with Rashba spin-orbit
coupling. This enhanced stability arises from the competition between field and
easy-plane magnetic anisotropy and results in a nontrivial structure in the
topological charge density in the core of the skyrmions. We further show that,
in a variety of microscopic models for magnetic exchange, the required
easy-plane anisotropy naturally arises from the same spin-orbit coupling that
is responsible for the chiral Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Our results
are of particular interest for 2D materials like thin films, surfaces, and
oxide interfaces, where broken surface-inversion symmetry and Rashba spin-orbit
coupling naturally lead to chiral exchange and easy-plane compass anisotropy.
Our theory gives a clear direction for experimental studies of 2D magnetic
materials to stabilize skyrmions over a large range of magnetic fields down to
T=0.

the black hole mass and luminosity function and the galaxy mass function at low
redshift, the black hole to bulge mass relation, and the morphological
distribution at low redshift. For the first time in a semianalytical
investigation, we relax the simplifying assumptions of perfect coherency or
perfect isotropy of the gas fueling the black holes. The dynamics of gas is
instead linked to the morphological properties of the host galaxies, resulting
in different spin distributions for black holes hosted in different galaxy
types. We compare our results with the observed sample of spin measurements
obtained through broad K$\alpha$ iron line fitting. The observational data
disfavor both accretion along a fixed direction and isotropic fueling.
Conversely, when the properties of the accretion flow are anchored to the
kinematics of the host galaxy, we obtain a good match between theoretical
expectations and observations. A mixture of coherent accretion and phases of
activity in which the gas dynamics is similar to that of the stars in bulges

hole, and theoretical studies suggest that when such galaxies have a major
merger, the central black holes will form a binary and eventually coalesce.
Here we discuss two spectral signatures of such binaries that may help
distinguish them from ordinary AGN. These signatures are expected when the mass
ratio between the holes is not extreme and the system is fed by a circumbinary
disk. One such signature is a notch in the thermal continuum that has been
predicted by other authors; we point out that it should be accompanied by a
spectral revival at shorter wavelengths and also discuss its dependence on
binary properties such as mass, mass ratio, and separation. In particular, we
note that the wavelength $\lambda_n$ at which the notch occurs depends on these
three parameters in such a way as to make the number of systems displaying
these notches $\propto \lambda_n^{16/3}$; longer wavelength searches are
therefore strongly favored. A second signature, first discussed here, is hard
X-ray emission with a Wien-like spectrum at a characteristic temperature $\sim
100$ keV produced by Compton cooling of the shock generated when streams from
the circumbinary disk hit the accretion disks around the individual black
holes. We investigate the observability of both signatures. The hard X-ray
signal may be particularly valuable as it can provide an indicator of black
hole merger a few decades in advance of the event.

non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects including Ohmic resistivity, the
Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion. Among these the role of the Hall effect is
the least explored and most poorly understood. We have included all three
non-ideal MHD effects in a self-consistent manner to investigate the role of
the Hall effect on PPD gas dynamics using local shearing-box simulations. In
this first paper, we focus on the inner region of PPDs, where previous studies
excluding the Hall effect have revealed that the inner disk up to ~10 AU is
largely laminar, with accretion driven by a magnetocentrifugal wind. We confirm
this basic picture and show that the Hall effect introduces modest
modifications to the wind solutions, depending on the polarity of the
large-scale poloidal magnetic field B_0 threading the disk. When B_0.Omega>0,
the horizontal magnetic field is strongly amplified toward the disk interior,
leading to a stronger disk wind (by ~50% or less in terms of the wind-driven
accretion rate). The enhanced horizontal field also leads to much stronger
large-scale Maxwell stress (magnetic braking) that contributes to a
considerable fraction of the wind-driven accretion rate. When B_0.Omega<0, the
horizontal magnetic field is reduced, leading to a weaker disk wind (by ~20%)
and negligible magnetic braking. Moreover, we find that when B_0.Omega>0, the
laminar region extends farther to ~15 AU before the magneto-rotational
instability sets in, while for B_0.Omega<0, the laminar region extends only to
~3-5 AU for a typical PPD accretion rates. Scaling relations for the wind
properties, especially the wind-driven accretion rate, are provided for aligned

the initial stages of planet formation. Here we provide a review and synthesis

from these mechanisms, particularly planet-induced disk clearing, compare to
actual observations. Lastly, we discuss future avenues of inquiry to be pursued

derived for an arbitrary set of mutually unbiased bases. Such relations are
extended with a recent notion of mutually unbiased measurements. The case of
so-called mutually biased bases is considered in a similar manner. We also
discuss a formulation of fine-grained uncertainty relations in the case of
generalized measurements. The general approach is then applied to two
measurements related to state discrimination. The case of three rank-one
projective measurements is further examined in details. In particular, we
consider fine-grained uncertainty relations for mutually unbiased bases in

the Fermi level is embedded in a dense localized spectrum. The main tool for
our analysis is the winding number $\nu$, in the non-commutative formulation

insulating gap is completely filled with the localized spectrum. We demonstrate
that each topological transition is accompanied by an Anderson
localization-delocalization transition. Furthermore, to explicitly rule out a
$\mathbb Z_2$ classification, a topological transition between $\nu=0$ and
$\nu=2$ is generated. These two phases are also found to be separated by an
Anderson localization-delocalization transition, hence proving their distinct
identity.

quantities, in particular the static potential from Wilson Loop, the W
propagator, and the plaquette expectation value. Our results suggest that a
confinement-like region and a Higgs-like region appear even in two dimensions.
In the confinement-like region, the static potential rises linearly, with
string breaking at large distances, while in the Higgs-like region, it is of
Yukawa type, consistent with a Higgs-type mechanism. The correlation length
obtained from the W propagator has a finite maximum between these regions. The
plaquette expectation value shows a smooth cross-over consistent with the
Fradkin-Shenker-Osterwalder-Seiler theorem. From these results, we suggest that
there is no phase transition in two dimensions. We also calculate a
gauge-dependent order parameter in Landau gauge. Unlike gauge invariant
quantities, the gauge non-invariant order parameter has a line of discontinuity
separating these two regions. Finally we calculate the gluon propagtor. We
infer from its infrared behavior that the gluon propagator would vanish at zero
momentum in the infinite-volume limit, consistent with an analytical study.

clustering (SLC) effect has two sources, intrinsic source clustering and cosmic
magnification (magnification/size bias). Lensing tomography can suppress the
former. However, this reduction is limited by the existence of photo-z error
and nonzero redshift bin width. Furthermore, SLC induced by cosmic
magnification cannot be reduced by lensing tomography. Through N-body
simulations, we quantify the impact of SLC on the lensing power spectrum in the
context of lensing tomography. We consider both the standard estimator and the
pixel-based estimator. We find that none of them can satisfactorily handle both
sources of SLC. (1) For the standard estimator, SLC induced by both sources can
bias the lensing power spectrum by O(1)-O(10)%. Intrinsic source clustering
also increases statistical uncertainties in the measured lensing power
spectrum. However, the standard estimator suppresses intrinsic source
clustering in the cross-spectrum. (2) In contrast, the pixel-based estimator
suppresses SLC through cosmic magnification. However, it fails to suppress SLC
through intrinsic source clustering and the measured lensing power spectrum can
be biased low by O(1)-O(10)%. In short, for typical photo-z errors
(sigma_z/(1+z)=0.05) and photo-z bin sizes (Delta_z^P=0.2), SLC alters the
lensing E-mode power spectrum by 1-10%, with ell~10^3$ and z_s~1 being of
particular interest to weak lensing cosmology. Therefore the SLC is a severe
systematic for cosmology in Stage-IV lensing surveys. We present useful scaling

possible to automatically derive a distributed implementation from a set of
scenarios augmented with a set of safety and liveness requirements, provided
the given scenarios adequately \emph{cover} all the states of the desired
implementation. We first derive incomplete state machines from the given
scenarios, and then synthesis corresponds to completing the transition relation
of individual processes so that the global product meets the specified
requirements. This completion problem, in general, has the same complexity,
PSPACE, as the verification problem, but unlike the verification problem, is
NP-complete for a constant number of processes. We present two algorithms for
solving the completion problem, one based on a heuristic search in the space of
possible completions and one based on OBDD-based symbolic fixpoint computation.
We evaluate the proposed methodology for protocol specification and the
effectiveness of the synthesis algorithms using the classical alternating-bit

frame. For Dirac fields, the degree of degradation with acceleration of both
one-tangle of accelerated observer and {\pi}-tangle, for the same initial

for any choice of acceleration and the degree of initial entanglement. For
scalar field, the one-tangle of accelerated observer depends on the choice of
values of probability amplitudes and it vanishes in the range of infinite
acceleration, whereas for {\pi}-tangle this is not always true. The dependence
of {\pi}-tangle on probability amplitudes varies with acceleration. In the
lower range of acceleration, its behavior changes by switching between the
values of probability amplitudes and for larger values of acceleration this

entanglement, the degradation of {\pi}-tangle against acceleration in the case
of scalar fields is slower than for Dirac fields.

box in important follow-up results [Gan09, CK09, AS10, CK11, KZ13] the result
has not been peer-reviewed, its novel techniques (and in particular Kitaev's
point game formalism) have not been applied anywhere else, and an explicit
protocol is missing. We believe that truly understanding the existence proof
and the novel techniques it relies on would constitute a major step in quantum
information theory, leading to deeper understanding of entanglement and of
quantum protocols in general. In this work, we make a first step in this
direction. We simplify parts of Mochon's construction considerably, making
about 20 pages of analysis in the original proof superfluous, clarifying some
other parts of the proof on the way, and presenting the proof in a way which is
conceptually easier to grasp. We believe the resulting proof of existence is
easier to understand, more readable, and certainly verifiable. Moreover, we
analyze the resources needed to achieve a bias $\epsilon$ and show that the
number of qubits is $O(\log 1/\epsilon)$, while the number of rounds is
$(1/\epsilon)^{O(1/\epsilon)}$. A true understanding of the proof, including
Kitaev's point game techniques and their applicability, as well as completing
the task of constructing an explicit (and also simpler and more efficient)
protocol, are left to future work.

temperature of $1\times10^8$ K. Three distinct radio components which resemble
jet elements and/or hot spots, are also detected. The position angles of these
elongated jet elements point, not only to a curved jet in Mrk 6, but also
towards a connection between the AGN and the kpc-scale radio lobes/bubbles in
this galaxy. Firmer constraints on the star formation rate provided by new
Herschel observations (SFR $<0.8$ M$_\sun$ yr$^{-1}$) make the starburst-wind

Chandra X-ray observations, and ram pressure balance arguments for the ISM and
radio bubbles, the north-south bubbles are expected to take $7.5\times10^6$ yr

may be hindered by the occurrence of a Walker breakdown at comparably low
current density. We show how a Rashba interaction can stabilize the domain wall
dynamics and thereby shift the Walker breakdown to higher current densities.
The Rashba interaction creates a field like spin torque, which breaks the
symmetry of the system and modifies the internal structure of the domain wall.
Besides a shift of the Walker breakdown it can additionally induce a chirality
switch of the domain wall at sufficient Rashba fields. The preferred chirality
may then be chosen by the direction of the current flow. Both, the suppression
of the Walker breakdown and the chirality switching, affect the domain wall
velocity. This is even more pronounced for short current pulses, where an
additional domain wall movement after the pulse in either positive or negative
direction can determine the final position of the domain wall.

use of classifier committees where each classifier is trained on light curves

set matches the test light curve time span is invoked for classification. The
second solution uses hierarchical classifiers that are able to predict source
types both individually and by sub-group, so that the user can trade-off an
earlier, more robust classification with classification granularity. We test
both methods using light curves from the MACHO survey, and demonstrate their

astronomy. Concise metrics are needed to compare candidate sites for new
telescopes, to monitor the quality of existing sites, and to design telescopes
to work well at a given site. Key points of assessment are the receiver dynamic
range required for the strongest interferers and the expected fraction of
spectrum available for sensitive astronomical measurements. We propose three
metrics: (1) total radio frequency interference power, (2)
interference-to-noise power ratio and (3) time-frequency occupancy. Box plots
of these metrics summarise large quantities of information, highlight expected
ranges of interfering signal properties, and aid comparisons of sites and other
factors of interest. We provide examples for Square Kilometre Array phase one
deployment in Australia based on measurements made for the selection of this
site. The Square Kilometre Array will be the largest radio telescope in the

last decades to exploit monomial structures in systems of Laurent polynomials.
Roughly speaking, this amounts to computing in a \emph{semigroup algebra},

solve symbolically sparse systems, we introduce \emph{sparse Gr\""obner bases},
an analog of classical Gr\""obner bases for semigroup algebras, and we propose

in the case where the generating subset of monomials corresponds to the points
with integer coordinates in a normal lattice polytope $\mathcal P\subset\mathbb
R^n$ and under regularity assumptions, we prove complexity bounds which depend
on the combinatorial properties of $\mathcal P$. These bounds yield new
estimates on the complexity of solving $0$-dim systems where all polynomials
share the same Newton polytope (\emph{unmixed case}). For instance, we
generalize the bound $\min(n_1,n_2)+1$ on the maximal degree in a Gr\""obner
basis of a $0$-dim. bilinear system with blocks of variables of sizes
$(n_1,n_2)$ to the multilinear case: $\sum n_i - \max(n_i)+1$. We also propose

CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) lines, and the 3 and 1mm continuum taken with the IRAM
PdBI. We mapped the molecular gas of 3C293 and compared it with the dust and
star-formation images of the host. We searched for signatures of outflow
motions in the CO kinematics, and reexamined the evidence of outflowing gas in
the HI spectra. We also derived the star formation rate (SFR) and efficiency
(SFE) of the host with all available SFR tracers from the literature, and
compared them with the SFE of young and evolved radio galaxies and normal
star-forming galaxies. Results. The CO(1-0) emission line shows that the
molecular gas in 3C293 is distributed along a massive (2.2E10 Msun) warped disk
with diameter of 21 kpc that rotates around the AGN. Our data show that the
dust and the star formation are clearly associated with the CO disk. The
CO(2-1) emission is located in the inner 7 kpc (diameter) region around the
AGN, coincident with the inner part of the CO(1-0) disk. Both the CO(1-0) and
CO(2-1) spectra reveal the presence of an absorber against the central regions
of 3C293 that is associated with the disk. We do not detect any fast (>500
km/s) outflow motions in the cold molecular gas. The host of 3C293 shows an SFE
consistent with the Kennicutt-Schmidt law. The apparently low SFE of evolved
radio galaxies may be caused by an underestimation of the SFR and/or an
overestimation of the molecular gas densities in these sources. We find no
signatures of AGN feedback in the molecular gas of 3C293.

$P_k$-free graphs, plays a prominent role in algorithmic graph theory. This
motivates the search for special structural properties of $P_k$-free graphs,
including alternative characterizations.
  Let $G$ be a connected $P_k$-free graph, $k \ge 4$. We show that $G$ admits a
connected dominating set whose induced subgraph is either $P_{k-2}$-free, or
isomorphic to $P_{k-2}$. Surprisingly, it turns out that every minimum
connected dominating set of $G$ has this property.
  This yields a new characterization for $P_k$-free graphs: a graph $G$ is
$P_k$-free if and only if each connected induced subgraph of $G$ has a
connected dominating set whose induced subgraph is either $P_{k-2}$-free, or
isomorphic to $C_k$. This improves and generalizes several previous results;
the particular case of $k=7$ solves a problem posed by van 't Hof and Paulusma
[A new characterization of $P_6$-free graphs, COCOON 2008].
  In the second part of the paper, we present an efficient algorithm that,
given a connected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, computes a connected
dominating set $X$ of $G$ with the following property: for the minimum $k$ such
that $G$ is $P_k$-free, the subgraph induced by $X$ is $P_{k-2}$-free or
isomorphic to $P_{k-2}$.
  As an application our results, we prove that Hypergraph 2-Colorability, an
NP-complete problem in general, can be solved in polynomial time for
hypergraphs whose vertex-hyperedge incidence graph is $P_7$-free.

independent decrease in X(CH3OH) with respect to CO of up to one order of
magnitude is also found in these objects. We conclude that gas-phase formation
of H2O must be active at high velocities (above 10 km/s, relative to the source
velocity) to re-form the water destroyed during sputtering. In addition, the
transition from sputtered water at low velocities to formed water at high
velocities must be gradual. We place an upper limit of two orders of magnitude
on the destruction of methanol by sputtering effects.

model, where the prey population is structured according to a certain life
history trait. The trait distribution within the prey population is the result
of interplay between genetic inheritance and mutation, as well as selectivity
in the consumption of prey by the predator. The evolutionary processes are
considered to take place on the same time scale as ecological dynamics, i.e. we
consider the evolution to be rapid. Previously published results show that
population structuring and rapid evolution in such predator-prey system can
stabilise an otherwise globally unstable dynamics even with an unlimited
carrying capacity of prey. However, those findings were only based on direct
numerical simulation of equations and obtained for particular parametrisations
of model functions, which obviously calls into question the correctness and
generality of the previous results. The main objective of the current study is
to treat the model analytically and consider various parametrisations of
predator selectivity and inheritance kernel. We investigate the existence of a
coexistence stationary state in the model and carry out stability analysis of
this state. We derive expressions for the Hopf bifurcation curve which can be
used for constructing bifurcation diagrams in the parameter space without the
need for a direct numerical simulation of the underlying integro-differential
equations. We analytically show the possibility of stabilisation of a globally
unstable predator-prey system with prey structuring. We prove that the
coexistence stationary state is stable when the saturation in the predation
term is low. Finally, for a class of kernels describing genetic inheritance and
mutation we show that stability of the predator-prey interaction will require a
selectivity of predation according to the life trait.

pulsars and are thought to be due to the presence of a superfluid component
within neutron stars. The precise glitch mechanism and its trigger, however,
remain unknown. The size of glitches is a key diagnostic for models of the
underlying physics. While the largest glitches have long been taken into
account by theoretical models, it has always been assumed that the minimum size
lay below the detectability limit of the measurements. In this paper we define
general glitch detectability limits and use them on 29 years of daily
observations of the Crab pulsar, carried out at Jodrell Bank Observatory. We
find that all glitches lie well above the detectability limits and by using an
automated method to search for small events we are able to uncover the full
glitch size distribution, with no biases. Contrary to the prediction of most
models, the distribution presents a rapid decrease of the number of glitches
below ~0.05 $\mu$Hz. This substantial minimum size indicates that a glitch must
involve the motion of at least several billion superfluid vortices and provides
an extra observable which can greatly help the identification of the trigger
mechanism. Our study also shows that glitches are clearly separated from all
the other rotation irregularities. This supports the idea that the origin of
glitches is different to that of timing noise, which comprises the unmodelled
random fluctuations in the rotation rates of pulsars.

introducing a suitable set of momentum-like modes we identify the microscopic
variables involved in the quantization process and the dynamical algebra of the

to a double oscillator. Interestingly, we find that the parameter-space domain
where this scheme entails a discrete spectrum well reproduces the two regions

notions of line graphs and path graphs. Let $G$ be a graph with no loops but
possibly with parallel edges. An \emph{$\ell$-link} of $G$ is a walk of $G$ of
length $\ell \geqslant 0$ in which consecutive edges are different. We identify
an $\ell$-link with its reverse sequence. The \emph{$\ell$-link graph
$\mathbb{L}_\ell(G)$} of $G$ is the graph with vertices the $\ell$-links of
$G$, such that two vertices are joined by $\mu \geqslant 0$ edges in
$\mathbb{L}_\ell(G)$ if they correspond to two subsequences of each of $\mu$
$(\ell + 1)$-links of $G$.
  By revealing a recursive structure, we bound from above the chromatic number
of $\ell$-link graphs. As a corollary, for a given graph $G$ and large enough
$\ell$, $\mathbb{L}_\ell(G)$ is $3$-colourable. By investigating the shunting
of $\ell$-links in $G$, we show that the Hadwiger number of a nonempty
$\mathbb{L}_\ell(G)$ is greater or equal to that of $G$. Hadwiger's conjecture
states that the Hadwiger number of a graph is at least the chromatic number of
that graph. The conjecture has been proved by Reed and Seymour (2004) for line
graphs, and hence $1$-link graphs. We prove the conjecture for a wide class of
$\ell$-link graphs.

investigate the influence of the order of the phase transition on the
anisotropic flow within a state-of-the-art hybrid approach that describes other
global observables reasonably well. We find that, in the hybrid approach, there
seems to be no sensitivity of the directed flow on the equation of state and in

explore more subtle sensitivities like e.g. the Cooper-Frye transition

the small-body flux is perturbed away by the giant planets into orbits that no
longer pose a threat to terrestrial planets inside the HZ. Obtaining the escape
rate this way is similar to computing the largest Liapunov exponent as the
exponential rate of divergence of two nearby orbits. For a terrestrial planet
inside the HZ, the escape rate value quantifies the ""protective"" effect that
the studied giant-planet system offers. Therefore, escape rates could provide
information on whether certain giant-planet configurations produce a more
desirable environment for life than the others. We present some computed escape

fashion and usually such a discrete power control (DPC) scheme is suboptimal.
In this paper, we first show that in a Poison-distributed ad hoc network, if
DPC is properly designed with a certain condition satisfied, it can strictly
work better than constant power control (i.e. no power control) in terms of
average signal-to-interference ratio, outage probability and spatial reuse.
This motivates us to propose an $N$-layer DPC scheme in a wireless clustered ad
hoc network, where transmitters and their intended receivers in circular
clusters are characterized by a Poisson cluster process (PCP) on the plane
$\mathbb{R}^2$. The cluster of each transmitter is tessellated into $N$-layer
annuli with transmit power $P_i$ adopted if the intended receiver is located at
the $i$-th layer. Two performance metrics of transmission capacity (TC) and
outage-free spatial reuse factor are redefined based on the $N$-layer DPC. The
outage probability of each layer in a cluster is characterized and used to
derive the optimal power scaling law
$P_i=\Theta\left(\eta_i^{-\frac{\alpha}{2}}\right)$, with $\eta_i$ the
probability of selecting power $P_i$ and $\alpha$ the path loss exponent.
Moreover, the specific design approaches to optimize $P_i$ and $N$ based on

in particular, nowadays optical parametric oscillators are one of the most
versatile and tunable sources of coherent light, as well as the sources of the
highest quality quantum-correlated light in the continuous variable regime.
Being nonlinear systems, they can be driven through critical points in which a
solution ceases to exist in favour of a new one, and it is close to these
points where quantum correlations are the strongest. The simplest description
of such systems consists in writing the quantum fields as the classical part
plus some quantum fluctuations, linearizing then the dynamical equations with
respect to the latter; however, such an approach breaks down close to critical
points, where it provides unphysical predictions such as infinite photon
numbers. On the other hand, techniques going beyond the simple linear
description become too complicated especially regarding the evaluation of
two-time correlators, which are of major importance to compute observables
outside the cavity. In this article we provide a regularized linear description
of nonlinear cavities, that is, a linearization procedure yielding physical
results, taking the degenerate optical parametric oscillator as the guiding
example. The method, which we call self-consistent linearization, is shown to
be equivalent to a general Gaussian ansatz for the state of the system, and we

theories of finite character strings, and then transporting it to natural
numbers, by using them to model strings and their concatenation. Proof systems
are expressed via Turing machines that halt if and only if their input string
is a theorem. This approach makes it possible to present all but one parts of
the proof rather briefly with simple and straightforward constructions. The
details require some care, but do not require significant background knowledge.
The missing part is the widely known fact that Turing machines can perform
complicated computational tasks.

well-known {\em disjointness} problem and show also that for this promise

probabilistic) communication complexity and deterministic communication
complexity of the promise version of such a disjointness problem. Finally, some
applications to quantum, probabilistic and deterministic finite automata of the

be implemented through the Viterbi algorithm (VA). However, in many cases of
interest the memory of the channel prohibits application of the VA. A popular
and conceptually simple method in this case, studied since the early 70s, is to
first filter the received signal in order to shorten the memory of the channel,
and then to apply a VA that operates with the shorter memory. We shall refer to
this as a channel shortening (CS) receiver. Although studied for almost four
decades, an information theoretic understanding of what such a simple receiver
solution is actually doing is not available.
  In this paper we will show that an optimized CS receiver is implementing the
chain rule of mutual information, but only up to the shortened memory that the
receiver is operating with. Further, we will show that the tools for analyzing
the ensuing achievable rates from an optimized CS receiver are precisely the
same as those used for analyzing the achievable rates of a minimum mean square

the six filter integrated light measurements from near ultraviolet to near
infrared wavelengths, made as part of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda
Treasury (PHAT). We derive the ages and masses using a probabilistic technique,
which accounts for the effects of stochastic sampling of the stellar initial
mass function. Tests on synthetic data show that this method, in conjunction
with the exquisite sensitivity of the PHAT observations and their broad
wavelength baseline, provides robust age and mass recovery for clusters ranging
from $\sim 10^2 - 2 \times 10^6 M_\odot$. We find that the cluster age
distribution is consistent with being uniform over the past $100$ Myr, which
suggests a weak effect of cluster disruption within M31. The age distribution
of older ($>100$ Myr) clusters fall towards old ages, consistent with a
power-law decline of index $-1$, likely from a combination of fading and
disruption of the clusters. We find that the mass distribution of the whole
sample can be well-described by a single power-law with a spectral index of
$-1.9 \pm 0.1$ over the range of $10^3-3 \times 10^5 M_\odot$. However, if we
subdivide the sample by galactocentric radius, we find that the age
distributions remain unchanged. However, the mass spectral index varies
significantly, showing best fit values between $-2.2$ and $-1.8$, with the
shallower slope in the highest star formation intensity regions. We explore the
robustness of our study to potential systematics and conclude that the cluster
mass function may vary with respect to environment.

demonstrate the improvement from using SA-MCCI on the dipole of the $2$

classes of large scale net- worked embedded systems. However, WSNs system
designers must fulfill the Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements imposed by the
applications (and users). Very harsh and dynamic physical environments and
extremely limited energy/computing/memory/communication node resources are
major obstacles for satisfying QoS metrics such as reliability, timeliness and
system lifetime. The limited communication range of WSN nodes, link asymmetry
and the characteristics of the physical environment lead to a major source of
QoS degradation in WSNs. This paper proposes a Link Reliability based Two-Hop
Routing protocol for wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The protocol achieves to
reduce packet deadline miss ratio while consid- ering link reliability, two-hop
velocity and power efficiency and utilizes memory and computational effective
methods for estimating the link metrics. Numerical results provide insights
that the protocol has a lower packet deadline miss ratio and longer sensor
network lifetime. The results show that the proposed protocol is a feasible
solution to the QoS routing problem in wireless sensor networks that support
real-time applications.

systems in nature and society. To understand complex networks, it is crucial to
explore their internal structures, also called structural regularities. The
task of network structure exploration is to determine how many groups in a
complex network and how to group the nodes of the network. Most existing
structure exploration methods need to specify either a group number or a
certain type of structure when they are applied to a network. In the real
world, however, not only the group number but also the certain type of
structure that a network has are usually unknown in advance. To automatically
explore structural regularities in complex networks, without any prior
knowledge about the group number or the certain type of structure, we extend a
probabilistic mixture model that can handle networks with any type of structure
but needs to specify a group number using Bayesian nonparametric theory and
propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric model, called the Bayesian nonparametric
mixture (BNPM) model. Experiments conducted on a large number of networks with
different structures show that the BNPM model is able to automatically explore
structural regularities in networks with a stable and state-of-the-art
performance.
