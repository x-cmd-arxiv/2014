unknown parameters from linear equations, which are perturbed by Gaussian
noise.
  In case the unknown parameters have only few nonzero entries, the proposed
estimator performs more efficiently than a traditional approach.
  The method consists of three steps:
  (1) a classical Least Squares Estimate (LSE),
  (2) the support is recovered through a Linear Programming (LP) optimization
problem which can be computed using a soft-thresholding step,
  (3) a de-biasing step using a LSE on the estimated support set.
  The main contribution of this note is a formal derivation of an associated
ORACLE property of the final estimate.
  That is, when the number of samples is large enough, the estimate is shown to
equal the LSE based on the support of the {\em true} parameters.

The spectral decomposition of the generator matrix of a stochastic network
exposes all of the transition processes in the system. The assumption of the
existence of a low lying group of eigenvalues separated by a spectral gap,
leading to factorization of the dynamics, has become a popular theme. We
consider stochastic networks representing potential energy landscapes where the
states and the edges correspond to local minima and transition states
respectively, and the pairwise transition rates are given by the Arrhenuis
formula. Using the minimal spanning tree, we construct the asymptotics for
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the generator matrix starting from the low
lying group. This construction gives rise to an efficient algorithm for
computing the asymptotic spectrum suitable for large and complex networks. We
apply it to Wales's Lennard-Jones-38 network with 71887 states and 119853 edges
where the underlying potential energy landscape has a double-funnel structure.
Our results demonstrate that the concept of metastability should be applied
with care to this system. In particular, for the full network, there is no
significant spectral gap separating the eigenvalue corresponding to the exit
from the wider and shallower icosahedral funnel at any reasonable temperature
range.

mean that the agents cannot share their state, so execution must proceed in a
decentralized fashion. While Dec-POMDPs are typically intractable to solve for
real-world problems, recent research on the use of macro-actions in Dec-POMDPs
has significantly increased the size of problem that can be practically solved

most existing methods that are specialized to a particular problem class, it
can synthesize control policies that use whatever opportunities for
coordination are present in the problem, while balancing off uncertainty in

are given to identify parameter regions where the history force is expected to
be comparable with the Stokes drag. As an illustrative example, a paradigmatic
two-dimensional flow, the von K\'arm\'an flow is taken. For small (but not
extremely small) particles all investigated dynamical properties turn out to
heavily depend on the presence of memory when compared to the memoryless case:
the history force generates a rather non-trivial dynamics that appears to
weaken (but not to suppress) inertial effects, it enhances the overall
contribution of viscosity. We explore the parameter space spanned by the
particle size and the density ratio, and find a weaker tendency for
accumulation in attractors and for caustics formation. The Lyapunov exponent of
transients becomes larger with memory. Periodic attractors are found to have a
very slow, $t^{-1/2}$ type convergence towards the asymptotic form. We find
that the concept of snapshot attractors is useful to understand this slow
convergence: an ensemble of particles converges exponentially fast towards a
snapshot attractor, which undergoes a slow shift for long times.

by Yu et al. (ICCAD'11), Fang et al. (DAC'12), and Kuang et al. (DAC'13).
Furthermore, the balanced-density version of our decomposer can provide more
balanced density which leads to less edge placement error (EPE), while the
conflict and stitch numbers are still very comparable to our

process, defined by properties such as birefringence, spectral response,
thickness and flatness. Amongst many ways to achieve this, single-photon probes
can be used in a method called quantum process tomography (QPT). Furthermore,
QPT is an essential method in determining how a process acts on quantum
mechanical states. For example for quantum technology, QPT is used to
characterise multi-qubit processors and quantum communication channels; across
quantum physics QPT of some form is often the first experimental investigation
of a new physical process, as shown in the recent research into coherent
transport in biological mechanisms. However, the precision of QPT is limited by
the fact that measurements with single-particle probes are subject to
unavoidable shot noise---this holds for both single photon and laser probes. In
situations where measurement resources are limited, for example, where the
process is rapidly changing or the time bandwidth is constrained, it becomes
essential to overcome this precision limit. Here we devise and demonstrate a
scheme for tomography which exploits non-classical input states and quantum
interferences; unlike previous QPT methods our scheme capitalises upon the
possibility to use simultaneously multiple photons per mode. The
efficiency---quantified by precision per photon used---scales with larger
photon number input states. Our demonstration uses four-photon states and our
results show a substantial reduction of statistical fluctuations compared to
traditional QPT methods---in the ideal case one four-photon probe state yields
the same amount of statistical information as twelve single probe photons.

controlling the possible novel phases of the condensate remains largely
unexplored, and few-body aspects can play a central role in the properties and
dynamics of the system through manifestations of Efimov physics. The present
study solves the three-body problem for bosonic spinors using the
hyperspherical adiabatic representation and characterizes the multiple families
of Efimov states in spinor systems as well as their signatures in the
scattering observables relevant for spinor condensates. These solutions exhibit
a rich array of possible phenomena originating in universal few-body physics,
which can strongly affect the spin dynamics and three-body mean-field
contributions for spinor condensates. The collisional aspects of atom-dimer
spinor condensates are also analyzed and effects are predicted that derive from
Efimov physics.

theoretically. The method is adjusted such that its continuum limit is the
Navier-Stokes equation, with a driving force derived from the Cahn-Hilliard
free energy. In contrast to previous work, however, the bulk and interface
terms are decoupled, the former being incorporated into the model through the
local equilibrium populations, and the latter through a forcing term. We focus
on gas-liquid phase equilibria with the possibility to implement an arbitrary
equation of state. The most novel aspect of our approach is a systematic
Chapman-Enskog expansion up to the third order. Due to the third-order gradient
in the interface forcing term, this is needed for full consistency with both
hydrodynamics and thermodynamics. Our construction of a model that satisfies
all conditions is based upon previous work by Chen, Goldhirsch, and Orszag (J.
Sci. Comp. 34, 87 (2008)), and implies 59 and 21 velocities in three and two
dimensions, respectively. Applying the conditions of positivity of weights,
existence of a two-phase region in the phase diagram, and positivity of the
bulk viscosity, we find substantial restrictions on the permitted equation of
state, which can only be lifted by an even more refined model. Moreover, it
turns out that it is necessary to solve a self-consistent equation for the
hydrodynamic flow velocity, in order to enforce the identity of momentum
density and mass current on the lattice. The analysis completely identifies all
spurious terms in the Navier-Stokes equation, and thus shows how to
systematically eliminate each of them, by constructing a suitable collision
operator. (continued - see article PDF)

applications ranging from particle manipulation, microscopy and
nanotechnologies, to fundamental tests of quantum mechanics, classical data
multiplexing and quantum communication. Hitherto, however, all results obtained
with optical OAM were limited to laboratory scale. Here we report the
experimental demonstration of a link for free-space quantum communication with
OAM operating over a distance of 210 meters. Our method exploits OAM in
combination with optical polarization to encode the information in
rotation-invariant photonic states, so as to guarantee full independence of the
communication from the local reference frames of the transmitting and receiving
units. In particular, we implement quantum key distribution (QKD), a protocol
exploiting the features of quantum mechanics to guarantee unconditional
security in cryptographic communication, demonstrating error-rate performances
that are fully compatible with real-world application requirements. Our results
extend previous achievements of OAM-based quantum communication by over two
orders of magnitudes in the link scale, providing an important step forward in
achieving the vision of a worldwide quantum network.

running strong coupling effects. It generalizes CUJET1.0 by computing jet path
integrations though more realistic 2+1D transverse and longitudinally expanding
viscous hydrodynamical fields contrained by fits to low $p_T$ flow data. The

corresponding to an assumed upper bound on the vacuum running coupling in the
infrared and two chromo-electric and magnetic QGP screening mass scales $(f_E
\mu(T), f_M \mu(T))$ where $\mu(T)$ is the 1-loop Debye mass. We compare
numerical results as a function of $\alpha_{max}$ for pure and deformed HTL

$v_2(p_T;\sqrt{s},b)$ is, however, found to significantly underestimated
relative to RHIC and LHC data. We find the $\chi^2_{v_2}$ analysis shows that

theoretical predictions, hysteresis has not been previously observed in any
superfluid, atomic-gas Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here we demonstrate
hysteresis in a quantized atomtronic circuit: a ring of superfluid BEC
obstructed by a rotating weak link. We directly detect hysteresis between
quantized circulation states, in contrast to superfluid liquid helium
experiments that observed hysteresis directly in systems where the quantization
of flow could not be observed and indirectly in systems that showed quantized
flow. Our techniques allow us to tune the size of the hysteresis loop and to
consider the fundamental excitations that accompany hysteresis. The results
suggest that the relevant excitations involved in hysteresis are vortices and
indicate that dissipation plays an important role in the dynamics. Controlled
hysteresis in atomtronic circuits may prove to be a crucial feature for the
development of practical devices, just as it has in electronic circuits like
memory, digital noise filters (e.g., Schmitt triggers), and magnetometers
(e.g., SQUIDs).

and models the molecular mechanisms of Pb release during Portland cement
leaching. As Pb release is strongly related to its speciation (i.e. atomic
environment and the nature of bearing phases), the first objective of the
present study was to investigate the evolution of Pb retention sites together
with the evolution of the cement mineralogy during leaching. Complementary and
efficient investigation tools were used, namely X-ray diffraction, micro-X-ray
fluorescence and X-ray absorption fine structures. The second objective was to
reproduce our results with a reactive transport code (CHESS/HYTEC) in order to
test the proposed speciation model of Pb. Combined results indicate that in
both the unaltered core and the altered layer of the leached cement, Pb(II)
would be retained through C-S-H 'nano-structure', probably linked to a Q1 or
Q2P silicate tetrahedra. Moreover in the altered layer, the presence of Fe
atoms in the atomic environment of Pb is highly probable. Unfortunately little
is known about Fe phases in cement, which makes the interpretation difficult.
Can Fe- substituted hydrogranet (C3AH6) be responsible for Pb retention?
Modelling results were consistent with Pb retention through C-S-H in layers and
also in an additional, possibly Fe-containing, Pb-retention phase in the
altered layer.

previous studies, which have mainly relied on conventional census data such as

naturally (in terms of data speaks for itself) delineated cities, or natural

remains almost valid at the continental level except for Africa at certain time
instants. We further examine the law at the country level, and note that Zipf's
law is violated from country to country or from time to time. This violation is
mainly due to our limitations; we are limited to individual countries, or to a
static view on city-size distributions. The central argument of this paper is
that Zipf's law is universal, and we therefore must use the correct scope in
order to observe it. We further find Zipf's law applied to city numbers; the
number of cities in the first largest country is twice as many as that in the
second largest country, three times as many as that in the third largest
country, and so on. These findings have profound implications for big data and

when interpreted as a three-dimensional radial function, the exact solution
leaves the polynomial subspace for a time, but returns (up to roundoff
accuracy) to the same point evolved to by the projected dynamics in that time.
By contrast, using classical polynomials, the exact solution differs
significantly from the projected dynamics solution when it returns to the

show that thermal broadening is dominant in this system and, when this effect

two of the DLAs showing C II* absorption, we find that the metagalactic
background radiation alone is not sufficient to explain the observed C II*
cooling rate, and local heating sources, probably produced by in-situ star
formation, are needed. Cosmic ray heating is found to contribute $\gtrsim$ 60%

the other hand, the observed profile shows a significant dependence on the
galaxy sample used to trace the matter distribution. Samples including low-mass

corona above the photosphere of an accretion disk is explored using three
dimensional radiation magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. The thermal
properties of the disk are calculated self-consistently by balancing radiative
cooling through the surfaces of the disk with heating due to dissipation of
turbulence driven by magneto-rotational instability (MRI). As has been noted in
previous work, we find the dissipation rate per unit mass increases
dramatically with height above the mid-plane, in stark contrast to the
alpha-disk model which assumes this quantity is a constant. Thus, we find that
in simulations with a low surface density (and therefore a shallow
photosphere), the fraction of energy dissipated above the photosphere is
significant (about 3.4% in our lowest surface density model), and this fraction
increases as surface density decreases. When a significant fraction of the
accretion energy is dissipated in the optically thin photosphere, the gas
temperature increases substantially and a high temperature, magnetic pressure
supported corona is formed. The volume-averaged temperature in the disk corona
is more than 10 times larger than at the disk mid-plane. Moreover, gas
temperature in the corona is strongly anti-correlated with gas density, which
implies the corona formed by MRI turbulence is patchy. This mechanism to form
an accretion disk corona may help explain the observed relation between the

absorption lines in a sample of 22 Low Ionization Broad Absorption Line QSOs
(LoBAL QSOs) at 0.2 <= zem <= 2.1 using the 2m telescope at IUCAA Girawali
Observatory over a time-scale of 10 days to 7.69 years in the QSO's rest frame.
Spectra are analysed in conjunction with photometric light curves from Catalina
Real-Time Transient Survey. Long time-scale (i.e >= 1 year) absorption line
variability is seen in 8 cases (36% systems) while only 4 of them (i.e 18%
systems) show variability over short time-scales (i.e < 1 year). We notice a
tendency of highly variable LoBAL QSOs to have high ejection velocity, low
equivalent width and low redshift. The detection rate of variability in LoBAL
QSOs showing Fe fine-structure lines (FeLoBAL QSOs) is less than that seen in
non-Fe LoBAL QSOs. Absorption line variability is more frequently detected in
QSOs having continuum dominated by Fe emission lines compared to rest of the
QSOs. Confirming these trends with a bigger sample will give vital clues for
understanding the physical distinction between different BAL QSO sub-classes.
We correlate the absorption line variability with various parameters derived
from continuum light curves and find no clear correlation between continuum
flux and absorption line variabilities. However, sources with large absorption
line variability also show large variability in their light curves. We also see
appearance/disappearance of absorption components in 2 cases and clear
indications for profile variations in 4 cases. The observed variability can be
best explained by a combination of process driven by continuum variations and
clouds transiting across the line of sight.

transport effects allowed by the lack of boost invariance and constrain them by
the local second law of thermodynamics. Imposing time-reversal invariance, we

finite generating set $X$ of $G$ such that $(G,X)$ has the `falsification by
fellow traveler property' provided that the parabolic subgroups
$\{H_\omega\}_{\omega\in \Omega}$ have this property with respect to the
generating sets $\{X\cap H_\omega\}_{\omega\in \Omega}$. This implies that
groups hyperbolic relative to virtually abelian subgroups, which include all
limit groups and groups acting freely on $\mathbb{R}^n$-trees, or geometrically
finite hyperbolic groups, have generating sets for which the language of
geodesics is regular, and the complete growth series and complete geodesic
series are rational. As an application of our techniques, we prove that if each
$H_\omega$ admits a geodesic biautomatic structure over $X\cap H_\omega$, then
$G$ has a geodesic biautomatic structure.
  Similarly, we construct a finite generating set $X$ of $G$ such that $(G,X)$
has the `bounded conjugacy diagrams' property or the `neighbouring shorter
conjugate' property if the parabolic subgroups $\{H_\omega\}_{\omega\in
\Omega}$ have this property with respect to the generating sets $\{X\cap
H_\omega\}_{\omega\in \Omega}$. This implies that a group hyperbolic relative
to abelian subgroups has a generating set for which its Cayley graph has
bounded conjugacy diagrams, a fact we use to give a cubic time algorithm to
solve the conjugacy problem.
  Another corollary of our results is that groups hyperbolic relative to
virtually abelian subgroups have a regular language of conjugacy geodesics.

distinguish between different realizations in the fermionic sector, thus
providing crucial information about the nature of the UV dynamics.

high-quality spectra of Holmberg IX X-1 above 10 keV to date, extending the
X-ray coverage of this remarkable source up to ~30 keV. Broadband observations
were undertaken at two epochs, between which Holmberg IX X-1 exhibited both
flux and strong spectral variability, increasing in luminosity from Lx =
(1.90+/-0.03)e40 erg/s to Lx = (3.35+/-0.03)e40 erg/s. Neither epoch exhibits a
spectrum consistent with emission from the standard low/hard accretion state
seen in Galactic black hole binaries, that would have been expected if Holmberg
IX X-1 harbors a truly massive black hole accreting at substantially
sub-Eddington accretion rates. The NuSTAR data confirm that the curvature
observed previously in the 3-10 keV bandpass does represent a true spectral
cutoff. During each epoch, the spectrum appears to be dominated by two
optically thick thermal components, likely associated with an accretion disk.
The spectrum also shows some evidence for a non-thermal tail at the highest
energies, which may further support this scenario. The available data allow for
either of the two thermal components to dominate the spectral evolution,
although both scenarios require highly non-standard behavior for thermal
accretion disk emission.

that the behavior of the robotic system is not specified a priori (as standard)

teaching stages and operating stages of the robotic system. At that the
decision-maker can act slowly having the possibility to weigh the decision
made. This way allows the robotic system reacting flexibly by switching between
preset models and respond to the environment instability. The data integrity

called self-affine tiles. Effective characterization and recognition theorems
for these 3-manifolds as well as theoretical generalizations of these results
to higher dimensions are established. The methods developed build a bridge
linking geometric topology with iterated function systems and their attractors.
  A method to model self-affine tiles by simple iterative systems is developed
in order to study their topology. The model is functorial in the sense that
there is an easily computable map that induces isomorphisms between the natural
subdivisions of the attractor of the model and the self-affine tile. It has
many beneficial qualities including ease of computation allowing one to
determine topological properties of the attractor of the model such as
connectedness and whether it is a manifold. The induced map between the
attractor of the model and the self-affine tile is a quotient map and can be
checked in certain cases to be monotone or cell-like. Deep theorems from
geometric topology are applied to characterize and develop algorithms to
recognize when a self-affine tile is a topological or generalized manifold in
all dimensions. These new tools are used to check that several self-affine
tiles in the literature are 3-balls. An example of a wild 3-dimensional
self-affine tile is given whose boundary is a topological 2-sphere but which is
not itself a 3-ball. The paper describes how any 3-dimensional handlebody can

decision problem. Progress in SAT solving algorithms has motivated an ever
increasing number of practical applications in recent years. However, many
practical uses of SAT involve solving function as opposed to decision problems.
Concrete examples include computing minimal unsatisfiable subsets, minimal
correction subsets, prime implicates and implicants, minimal models, backbone
literals, and autarkies, among several others. In most cases, solving a
function problem requires a number of adaptive or non-adaptive calls to a SAT
solver. Given the computational complexity of SAT, it is therefore important to
develop algorithms that either require the smallest possible number of calls to
the SAT solver, or that involve simpler instances. This paper addresses a
number of representative function problems defined on Boolean formulas, and
shows that all these function problems can be reduced to a generic problem of
computing a minimal set subject to a monotone predicate. This problem is
referred to as the Minimal Set over Monotone Predicate (MSMP) problem. This
exercise provides new ways for solving well-known function problems, including
prime implicates, minimal correction subsets, backbone literals, independent
variables and autarkies, among several others. Moreover, this exercise
motivates the development of more efficient algorithms for the MSMP problem.
Finally the paper outlines a number of areas of future research related with
extensions of the MSMP problem.

scattering by impurities. Furthermore, we note that a discrepancy in sign of

Multiple cores have different irregularities; jointly these series are

regular time series: a data product. Typically, these cores are independently
processed. In this paper, we consider a fast Bayesian method for the joint
processing of multiple irregular series. This is shown to be more efficient.
Further, our approach permits a realistic modelling of the impact of the
multiple sources of uncertainty. The methodology is illustrated with the
analysis of a pair of ice cores (GISP2 and GRIP). Our data products, in the
form of marginal posterior distributions on an arbitrary temporal grid, are
finite Gaussian mixtures. We can also produce sample paths from the joint
posterior distribution to study non-linear functionals of interest. More
generally, the concept of joint analysis via hierarchical Gaussian process

of so-called `perfectly transmitting' wavefronts with transmission coefficients
close to 1 in strongly backscattering random media. These perfectly
transmitting eigen-wavefronts can be synthesized by spatial amplitude and phase
modulation. Here, we consider the problem of transmission enhancement using
phase-only modulated wavefronts. We develop physically realizable iterative and
non-iterative algorithms for increasing the transmission through such random
media using backscatter analysis. We theoretically show that, despite the
phase-only modulation constraint, the non-iterative algorithms will achieve at
least about 25$\pi$% or about 78.5% transmission assuming there is at least one
perfectly transmitting eigen-wavefront and that the singular vectors of the
transmission matrix obey a maximum entropy principle so that they are
isotropically random.
  We numerically analyze the limits of phase-only modulated transmission in 2-D
with fully spectrally accurate simulators and provide rigorous numerical
evidence confirming our theoretical prediction in random media with periodic
boundary conditions that is composed of hundreds of thousands of non-absorbing
scatterers. We show via numerical simulations that the iterative algorithms we
have developed converge rapidly, yielding highly transmitting wavefronts using
relatively few measurements of the backscatter field. Specifically, the best
performing iterative algorithm yields approx 70% transmission using just 15-20
measurements in the regime where the non-iterative algorithms yield
approximately 78.5% transmission but require measuring the entire modal

release during giant flares, in which a toroidal and helically twisted flux
rope is embedded within a force-free magnetosphere. The flux rope stays in
stable equilibrium states initially and evolves quasi-statically. Upon the loss
of equilibrium point is reached, the flux rope cannot sustain the stable
equilibrium states and erupts catastrophically. During the process, the
magnetic energy stored in the magnetosphere is rapidly released as the result
of destabilization of global magnetic topology. The magnetospheric energy that
could be accumulated is of vital importance for the outbursts of magnetars. We
carefully establish the fully open fields and partially open fields for various
boundary conditions at the magnetar surface and study the relevant energy
thresholds. By investigating the magnetic energy accumulated at the critical
catastrophic point, we find that it is possible to drive fully open eruptions
for dipole dominated background fields. Nevertheless, it is hard to generate
fully open magnetic eruptions for multipolar background fields. Given the
observational importance of the multipolar magnetic fields in the vicinity of
the magnetar surface, it would be worthwhile to explore the possibility of the
alternative eruption approach in multipolar background fields. Fortunately, we
find that flux ropes may give rise to partially open eruptions in the
multipolar fields, which involve only partial opening up of background fields.
The energy release fractions are greater for cases with central-arcaded
multipoles than those with central-caved multipoles emerged in background
fields. Eruptions would fail only when the centrally-caved multipoles become
extremely strong.

the set of integers with addition and the set of output strings with

using two-way finite-state transducers, (one-way) cost register automata, and
MSO-definable graph transformations. In this paper, we give an algebraic and
machine-independent characterization of this class analogous to the definition
of regular languages by regular expressions. When the monoid is commutative, we
prove that every regular function can be constructed from constant functions
using the combinators of choice, split sum, and iterated sum, that are analogs
of union, concatenation, and Kleene-*, respectively, but enforce unique (or
unambiguous) parsing. Our main result is for the general case of
non-commutative monoids, which is of particular interest for capturing regular
string-to-string transformations for document processing. We prove that the
following additional combinators suffice for constructing all regular

allow transformations such as string reversal; (2) sum of functions, which
allows transformations such as copying of strings; and (3) function

problems, with applications ranging from quiet standing to aircraft landing.
Increasingly much evidence appears in favor of event-driven control hypothesis:
human operators only start actively controlling the system when the discrepancy
between the current and desired system states becomes large enough. The
event-driven models based on the concept of threshold can explain many features
of the experimentally observed dynamics. However, much still remains unclear
about the dynamics of human-controlled systems, which likely indicates that
humans employ more intricate control mechanisms. The present paper argues that
control activation in humans may be not threshold-driven, but instead
intrinsically stochastic, noise-driven. Specifically, we suggest that control
activation stems from stochastic interplay between the operator's need to keep
the controlled system near the goal state on one hand and the tendency to
postpone interrupting the system dynamics on the other hand. We propose a model
capturing this interplay and show that it matches the experimental data on
human balancing of virtual overdamped stick. Our results illuminate that the
noise-driven activation mechanism plays a crucial role at least in the
considered task, and, hypothetically, in a broad range of human-controlled
processes.

and cluster candidates in M33 based on archival images from the Local Group
Galaxies Survey, which covers 0.8 deg$^2$ along the galaxy's major axis. Our
photometry includes 387, 563, 616, 580, and 478 objects in the $UBVRI$ bands,
respectively, of which 276, 405, 430, 457, and 363 do not have previously
published $UBVRI$ photometry. Our photometry is consistent with previous
measurements (where available) in all filters. We adopted Sloan Digital Sky
Survey $ugriz$ photometry for complementary purposes, as well as Two Micron
All-Sky Survey near-infrared $JHK$ photometry where available. We fitted the
spectral-energy distributions of 671 star clusters and candidates to derive
their ages, metallicities, and masses based on the updated {\sc parsec} simple
stellar populations synthesis models. The results of our $\chi^2$ minimization
routines show that only 205 of the 671 clusters ($31\%$) are older than 2 Gyr,
which represents a much smaller fraction of the cluster population than that in
M31 ($56\%$), suggesting that M33 is dominated by young star clusters ($<1$
Gyr). We investigate the mass distributions of the star clusters---both open
and globular clusters---in M33, M31, the Milky Way, and the Large Magellanic
Cloud. Their mean values are $\log(M_{\rm cl}/M_{\odot})=4.25$, 5.43, 2.72, and
4.18, respectively. The fraction of open to globular clusters is highest in the
Milky Way and lowest in M31. Our comparisons of the cluster ages, masses, and
metallicities show that our results are basically in agreement with previous
studies (where objects in common are available); differences can be traced back
to differences in the models adopted, the fitting methods used, and stochastic
sampling effects.

established part of the investor toolbox. We introduce a new way of analyzing
momentum strategies by looking at the information ratio (IR, average return
divided by standard deviation). We calculate the theoretical IR of a momentum
strategy, and show that if momentum is mainly due to the positive
autocorrelation in returns, IR as a function of the portfolio formation period
(look-back) is very different from momentum due to the drift (average return).
The IR shows that for look-back periods of a few months, the investor is more
likely to tap into autocorrelation. However, for look-back periods closer to 1
year, the investor is more likely to tap into the drift. We compare the
historical data to the theoretical IR by constructing stationary periods. The
empirical study finds that there are periods/regimes where the autocorrelation
is more important than the drift in explaining the IR (particularly pre-1975)
and others where the drift is more important (mostly after 1975). We conclude
our study by applying our momentum strategy to 100 plus years of the Dow-Jones
Industrial Average. We report damped oscillations on the IR for look-back
periods of several years and model such oscilations as a reversal to the mean
growth rate.

consist of many filaments. Polarization observations in optical and infrared
wavelengths indicate that the magnetic field often runs perpendicular to the
filament. In this paper, the magnetohydrostatic configuration of isothermal gas
is studied, in which the thermal pressure and the Lorentz force are balanced
against the self-gravity and the magnetic field is globally perpendicular to
the axis of the filament. The model is controlled by three parameters:
center-to-surface density ratio (\rho_c/\rho_s), plasma \beta of surrounding
interstellar gas (\beta_0) and the radius of the hypothetical parent cloud
normalized by the scale-height (R'_0), although there remains a freedom how the
mass is distributed against the magnetic flux (mass loading). In the case that
R'_0 is small enough, the magnetic field plays a role in confining the gas.
However, the magnetic field generally has an effect in supporting the cloud.
There is a maximum line-mass (mass per unit length) above which the cloud is
not supported against the gravity. Compared with the maximum line-mass of
non-magnetized cloud (2c_s^2/G, where c_s and G represent respectively the
isothermal sound speed and the gravitational constant), that of the magnetized
filament is larger than the non-magnetized one. The maximum line-mass is
numerically obtained as \lambda_max \simeq 0.24 \Phi_cl/G^1/2 + 1.66 c_s^2/G,
where \Phi_cl represents one half of the magnetic flux threading the filament
per unit length. The maximum mass of the filamentary cloud is shown to be
significantly affected by the magnetic field when the magnetic flux per unit
length exceeds \Phi_cl \gtrsim 3 pc \mu G (c_s/190 m s^-1)^2.

local slip at an interface between a deformable and a rigid solid. This
regularisation, which was proposed based on experimental observations, smooths
the effect of a sudden jump in the contact pressure over a characteristic
length scale. We apply it in numerical simulations in order to analyse its
influence on the behaviour of local slip. We first show that mesh convergence
in dynamic simulations is achieved without any numerical damping in the bulk
and draw a convergence map with respect to the characteristic length of the
friction regularisation. By varying this length scale on the example of a given
slip event, we observe that there is a critical length below which the friction
regularisation does not affect anymore the propagation of the interface
rupture. A spectral analysis of the regularisation on a periodic variation of
Coulomb's friction is conducted to confirm the existence of this critical
length. The results indicate that if the characteristic length of the friction
regularisation is smaller than the critical length, a slip event behaves as if
it was governed by Coulomb's law. We therefore propose that there is a domain
of influence of the friction regularisation depending on its characteristic
length and on the frequency content of the local slip event. A byproduct of the
analysis is related to the existence of a physical length scale characterising
a given frictional interface. We establish that the experimental determination
of this interface property may be achieved by experimentally monitoring slip
pulses whose frequency content is rich enough.

For $x<0.5$, due to the existence of a finite sized gap, the characteristic

For $x=0.5$, point nodes in the order parameter on the Fermi surface appear,

nodes which would usually induce different power-law dependencies in

define the entropy of the probability distribution on $X$ relative to the

approximately 104 atoms, which have not been investigated so far. Our
calculations demonstrate that the anisotropy energy of a Mn dopant in bulk GaAs
found to be non-zero in previous tight-binding calculations, is purely a finite
size effect, and it vanishes as the inverse cluster size. In contrast to this,
we find that the splitting of the three in-gap Mn acceptor energy levels
converges to a finite value in the limit of infinite cluster size. For a Mn in
bulk GaAs this feature is related to the nature of the mean-field treatment of
the coupling between the impurity and its nearest neighbors atoms. Moreover, we
calculate the trend of the anisotropy energy in the sublayers, as the Mn dopant
is moved away from the surface towards the center of the cluster. Here the use
of large cluster sizes allows us to position the impurity in deeper sublayers
below the surface, compared to previous calculations. In particular, we show
that the anisotropy energy increases up to the fifth sublayer and then
decreases as the impurity is moved further away from the surface, approaching
its bulk value. The present study provides important insight for experimental
control and manipulation of the electronic and magnetic properties of
individual Mn dopants at the semiconductor surface by means of advanced

differs qualitatively, at early times, from the one of the original model. More
precisely, when holonomy corrections are taken into account the universe is not
singular, starting at early times in the contracting phase and bouncing to
enter in the expanding one where, as in the original model, it inflates. This
dynamics is completely different from the one obtained in the original

non-overlapping communities. To extract these communities, the interaction
between pairs of nodes may be sampled from a large available data set, which
allows a given node pair to be sampled several times. When a node pair is
sampled, the observed outcome is a binary random variable, equal to 1 if nodes
interact and to 0 otherwise. The outcome is more likely to be positive if nodes
belong to the same communities. For a given budget of node pair samples or
observations, we wish to jointly design a sampling strategy (the sequence of
sampled node pairs) and a clustering algorithm that recover the hidden
communities with the highest possible accuracy. We consider both non-adaptive
and adaptive sampling strategies, and for both classes of strategies, we derive
fundamental performance limits satisfied by any sampling and clustering
algorithm. In particular, we provide necessary conditions for the existence of
algorithms recovering the communities accurately as the network size grows
large. We also devise simple algorithms that accurately reconstruct the
communities when this is at all possible, hence proving that the proposed
necessary conditions for accurate community detection are also sufficient. The
classical problem of community detection in the stochastic block model can be
seen as a particular instance of the problems consider here. But our framework
covers more general scenarios where the sequence of sampled node pairs can be
designed in an adaptive manner. The paper provides new results for the
stochastic block model, and extends the analysis to the case of adaptive
sampling.

quantum decoherence: how far apart in space do two parts of a quantum system

entirely separate? We frame this question specifically in a cold atom context.
How far apart do two populations of bosons have to be, before an environment of
thermal atoms of a different species (`buffer gas') responds to their two
particle numbers separately? An initial guess for this length scale is the
thermal coherence length of the buffer gas; we show that a standard Born-Markov
treatment partially supports this guess, but predicts only inverse-square
saturation of decoherence rates with distance, and not the much more abrupt
Gaussian behavior of the buffer gas's first-order coherence. We confirm this
Born-Markov result with a more rigorous theory, based on an exact solution of a
two-scatterer scattering problem, which also extends the result beyond weak
scattering. Finally, however, we show that when interactions within the buffer
gas reservoir are taken into account, an abrupt saturation of the decoherence
rate does occur, exponentially on the length scale of the buffer gas's mean
free path.

an output to the model parameters. They help in analyzing the network,

that perform finite-difference computations along with Monte Carlo simulations
of the reaction dynamics. These methods are computationally efficient and easy
to implement, but they produce a biased estimate which can be unreliable for
certain applications. Moreover the size of the bias is generally unknown and
hence the accuracy of these methods cannot be easily determined. There also
exist unbiased schemes for sensitivity estimation but these schemes can be
computationally infeasible, even for simple networks. Our goal in this paper is
to present a new method for sensitivity estimation, which combines the
computational efficiency of finite-difference methods with the accuracy of

Unlike single phase flows where a clear distinction exists between the laminar
and the turbulent states, three different regimes can be identified in the
presence of a particulate phase, with smooth transitions between them. At low
volume fractions, the flow becomes turbulent when increasing the Reynolds
number, transitioning from the laminar regime dominated by viscous forces to
the turbulent regime characterized by enhanced momentum transport by turbulent
eddies. At larger volume fractions, we identify a new regime characterized by
an even larger increase of the wall friction. The wall friction increases with
the Reynolds number (inertial effects) while the turbulent transport is weakly
affected, as in a state of intense inertial shear-thickening. This state may
prevent the transition to a fully turbulent regime at arbitrary high speed of

region faster than their largest Fourier component. Such signals have many
obvious scientific and technological applications, yet their practical use is
strongly limited by the fact that an overwhelming proportion of the energy goes
into that part of the signal, which is not superoscillating. In a recent
article the problem of optimization of such signals has been studied. In that
article the concept of superoscillation yield is defined as the ratio of the
energy in the super oscillations to the total energy of the signal, given the
range in time and frequency of the superoscillations, which is imposed by
forcing the signal to interpolate among a set of predetermined points. The
optimization of the superoscillation yield consists of obtaining the Fourier
coefficients of the low frequency components of which the signal consists, that
maximize the yield under the interpolation constraint. Since in practical
applications it is impossible to determine the Fourier coefficients with
infinite precision, it is necessary to answer two questions. The first is how
is the superoscillating nature of the signal affected by random small
deviations in those Fourier coefficients and the second is how is the yield
affected? These are the questions addressed in the present article. Limits on
the necessary precision are obtained. Those limits seem not to be impractical.

modeling of membership of subgroups in a community based on partially

where observations at different sites are classified in distinct species. Our
aim is to study the impact of additional covariates, for instance environmental
variables, on the data structure, and in particular on the community diversity.
To that purpose, we introduce dependence a priori across the covariates, and
show that it improves posterior inference. We use a dependent version of the
Griffiths-Engen-McCloskey distribution defined via the stick-breaking
construction. This distribution is obtained by transforming a Gaussian process
whose covariance function controls the desired dependence. The resulting
posterior distribution is sampled by Markov chain Monte Carlo. We illustrate
the application of our model to a soil microbial dataset acquired across a
hydrocarbon contamination gradient at the site of a fuel spill in Antarctica.
This method allows for inference on a number of quantities of interest in
ecotoxicology, such as diversity or effective concentrations, and is broadly
applicable to the general problem of communities response to environmental
variables.

earlier predicted blue and red shifts in the $\Delta n=0$ and $\Delta n \ne 0$

understand its early evolution, we perform numerical calculations of the
thermo-chemical evolution adopting new data obtained by the Dawn mission such
as mass, bulk density and size of the asteroid. We have expanded the model of
Neumann et al. (2012) that includes accretion, compaction, melting and
associated changes of material properties and partitioning of 26Al, advective
heat transport, and differentiation by porous flow, to include convection and
effective cooling in a magma ocean. Depending on the melt fraction, the heat
transport by melt segregation is modelled either by porous flow or by
convection and heat flux of a magma ocean with a high effective thermal
conductivity. We show that partitioning of 26Al and its transport with the
silicate melt is crucial for the formation of a magma ocean. Due to the
accumulation of 26Al in the sub-surface (for formation times t0<1.5 Ma), a
shallow magma ocean with a thickness of 1 to a few tens of km (depending on the
silicate melt viscosity) forms. The lifetime of the shallow magma ocean is
O(10^4)-O(10^6) years and convection in this layer is accompanied by the
extrusion of 26Al at the surface. The interior differentiates from the outside
inward with a mantle that is depleted in 26Al and core formation is completed
within ~0.3 Ma. The lower mantle experiences melting below 45% suggesting a
harzburgitic to dunitic composition. Our results support the formation of
eucrites by the extrusion of early partial melt and cumulative eucrites and
diogenites may form from the crystallizing shallow magma ocean. Silicate melt
is present for up to 150 Ma, and core convects for ~100 Ma, supporting the idea
of an early magnetic field.

compressible two-phase flows that involve phase transition between the liquid
and gaseous state of the fluid.
  The high-speed dynamics of cavitation bubbles is studied in well-resolved
simulations (DNS) with a sharp-interface numerical model on a micro scale. The
underlying assumption of the employed evaporation/condensation model is that
phase change occurs in thermal non-equilibrium and that the associated
timescale is larger than that of the wave dynamics. Results for the collapse of
a spherical vapor bubble close to a solid wall are discussed for three
different bubble-wall configurations. The major challenge for such numerical
investigations is to accurately reproduce the dynamics of the interface between
liquid and vapor during the entire collapse process, including the high-speed
dynamics of the late stages, where compressibility of both phases plays a
decisive role.
  Direct interface resolving simulations are intractable for real world
technical applications such as turbulent flows involving cavitation clouds with
millions of vapor bubbles and a wide range of time and length scales. For this
reason, we developed a coarse grained model for large-eddy simulation (LES) of
turbulent two-phase flows with cavitation. In LES, vapor bubbles constitute
sub-grid scales that have to be modeled accordingly. On the grid scale, we
solve the compressible Navier-Stokes equations for a homogeneous mixture of
liquid and vapor. For deriving an appropriate equation of state, we assume that
the characteristic time scale of phase change is much smaller than the
numerical time step and that phase change is isentropic and in mechanical
equilibrium at the saturation pressure. This macroscopic model is applied to
realistic technical problems and to more generic flows to study the mutual
interaction of turbulence and cavitation.

individual qubit of the code, taking spatial and temporal correlations between
the errors into account. We investigate numerically how different kinds of
spatial correlations between errors in the surface code affect its threshold
error rate. This allows us to derive the maximal duration of each quantum error
correction period by studying when the single-qubit error rate reaches the
corresponding threshold. At the time when error correction breaks down, the
error rate in the code can be dominated by the direct coupling of each qubit to
the bath, by mediated subluminal interactions, or by mediated superluminal
interactions. For a 2D Ohmic bath, the time available per quantum error
correction period vanishes in the thermodynamic limit of a large code size $L$
due to induced superluminal interactions, though it does so only like
$1/\sqrt{\log L}$. For all other bath types considered, this time remains
finite as $L\rightarrow\infty$.

brings the incidence rate of multiple/irregularly-modulated stars to 12 %. The
ratio of the modulation periods of five of the double-modulated stars was

But there are large discrepancies between RUS and thermodynamic measurements at

the frequency and temperature dependence of the RUS data for the crystal with

Hexagonal pattern arrangements with different dimensions (980, 620 and 480 nm,

the mask and the imaged resist layer were in intimate contact, a high fidelity
pattern replica was obtained after photolithography exposure and processing. In
turn, the presence of an air-gap in between has been found to affect the
projected image onto the photoresist layer, strongly dependent on the mask
feature size and air-gap height. Pattern replication, inversion and
hybridization was achieved for 980 nm-period mask; no hybridization for the 620

infinite number of dimensions for time-frequency varying fading channels, or
over an infinite number of rationally independent signal levels, in the case of
time-frequency invariant channels. In this work we consider a wireless cellular

precoding in one-shot (i.e., over a single time-frequency slot). We focus on
the uplink of a symmetric cellular system, where each cell is split into three
sectors with orthogonal intra-sector multiple access. In our model,
interference is ""local"", i.e., it is due to transmitters in neighboring cells
only. We consider a message-passing backhaul network architecture, in which
nearby sectors can exchange already decoded messages and propose an alignment
solution that can achieve the optimal DoFs. To avoid signaling schemes relying
on the strength of interference, we further introduce the notion of
\emph{topologically robust} schemes, which are able to guarantee a minimum rate
(or DoFs) irrespectively of the strength of the interfering links. Towards this
end, we design an alignment scheme which is topologically robust and still
achieves the same optimum DoFs.

conductivity can coexist. Variational Monte Carlo simulations show that three
kinds of ordered metallic states are stable as a function of nearest neighbor
interaction and filling. The coexistence of conductivity and order is explained
by a separation into two functional classes of particles: part of them
contributes to the stable order, while the other part forms a partially filled
band on the remaining substructure. The relation to charge ordering in charge
transfer salts is discussed.

the orbit in semi-detached double white dwarf binaries undergoing mass transfer
through direct impact of the transfer stream. We approximate the stream as a
series of discrete massive particles ejected in the ballistic limit at the
inner Lagrangian point of the donor toward the accretor. This work improves
upon similar earlier studies in a number of ways. First, we self-consistently
calculate the total angular momentum of the orbit at all times. This includes
changes in the orbital angular momentum during the ballistic trajectory of the
ejected mass, as well as changes during the ejection/accretion due to the
radial component of the particle's velocity. Second, we calculate the
particle's ballistic trajectory for each system, which allows us to determine
the precise position and velocity of the particle upon accretion. We can then
include specific information about the radius of the accretor as well as the
angle of impact. Finally, we ensure that the total angular momentum is
conserved, which requires the donor star spin to vary self-consistently. We
calculate the angular momentum change of the orbit and each binary component
across the entire parameter space of direct impact double white dwarf binaries.
We find a significant decrease in the amount of angular momentum removed from
the orbit during mass transfer, as well as cases where this process increases
the angular momentum of the orbit at the expense of the spin angular momentum
of the donor. We conclude that, unlike earlier claims in the literature, mass
transfer through direct impact need not destabilize the binary and that the
quantity and sign of the orbital angular momentum transfer depends on the
binary properties. This stabilization may significantly impact the population
synthesis calculations of double white dwarf progenitors.

This work highlights that this type of specialised chemical processor is a

These processors are also able to calculate two or more Voronoi diagrams in
parallel. Due to the specific chemical reactions involved and the relative
strength of reaction with the substrate (and cross-reactivity with the
products) these processors are also capable of calculating Voronoi diagrams
sequentially from distinct chemical inputs. The chemical processors are capable
of calculating a range of generalised Voronoi diagrams (either from circular
drops of chemical or other geometric shapes made from adsorbent substrates
soaked in reagent), skeletonisation of planar shapes and weighted Voronoi
diagrams (e.g. additively weighted Voronoi diagrams, Multiplicitavely weighted
Crystal growth Voronoi diagrams). The paper will also discuss some limitations
of these processors. These chemical processors constitute a class of pattern
forming reactions which have parallels with those observed in natural systems.
It is possible that specialised chemical processors of this general type could

giant branch (AGB) stars is incomplete. AGB models predict, for example, large
overabundances of lead (Pb) compared to other s-process elements in metal-poor
low-mass AGB stars. This is indeed observed in some extrinsically enhanced
metal-poor stars, but not in all. An extensive study of intrinsically s-process
enriched objects is essential for improving our knowledge of the AGB third
dredge-up and associated s-process nucleosynthesis. Aims: We compare the
spectral abundance analysis of the SMC post-AGB star J004441.04-732136.4 with
state-of-the-art AGB model predictions with a main focus on Pb. The low S/N in
the Pb line region made the result of our previous study inconclusive. We
acquired additional data covering the region of the strongest Pb line. Methods:
By carefully complementing re-reduced previous data, with newly acquired UVES
optical spectra, we improve the S/N of the spectrum around the strongest Pb
line. Therefore, an upper limit for the Pb abundance is estimated from a merged
weighted mean spectrum using synthetic spectral modeling. We then compare the
abundance results from the combined spectra to predictions of tailored AGB
evolutionary models from two independent evolution codes. In addition, we
determine upper limits for Pb abundances for three previously studied LMC
post-AGB objects. Results: Although theoretical predictions for
J004441.04-732136.4 match the s-process distribution up to tungsten (W), the
predicted very high Pb abundance is clearly not detected. The three additional
LMC post-AGB stars show a similar lack of a very high Pb abundance. Conclusion:
From our study, we conclude that none of these low-mass, low-metallicity
post-AGB stars of the LMC and SMC are strong Pb producers. This conflicts with
current theoretical predictions.

the doping level of the base material and its doping type as well as
Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) and surface recombination velocities are much more
important factors responsible for the photoconversion. We found that the
maximum photoconversion efficiency (about 27% for AM1.5 conditions) in GaAs
with typical parameters of recombination centers can be reached for p-type base

The approach of this research allows to predict the expected solar cells (for

presented in this paper. The principle objective is to examine an impact of the

Such a contact is characterized by a certain mismatching resistance allowing us
to represent a discontinuous evolution of temperature and moisture fields
across the interface, which is in general attributed to discontinuous capillary
pressures caused by different pore size distributions of the adjacent porous
materials. In achieving this, two particular laboratory experiments were
performed to provide distributions of temperature and relative humidity in a
sample of the masonry wall, which in turn served to extract the corresponding
jumps and subsequently to obtain the required interface transition parameters
by matching numerical predictions and experimental results. The results suggest
a low importance of accounting for imperfect hydraulic contact for the
derivation of macroscopic homogenized properties. On the other hand, they
strongly support the need for a fully coupled multi-scale analysis due to
significant dependence of the homogenized properties on actual moisture
gradients and corresponding values of both macroscopic temperature and relative
humidity.

the five-orbital Anderson impurity model by means of continuous time quantum
Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, and Hartree Fock calculations. The
dependence of the electronic excitation spectra and thermodynamic ground state
properties on hybridization strength and the form of the Coulomb interaction is
systematically investigated for impurity occupation number $N \approx 6$. With
increasing hybridization strength, a Kondo resonance emerges, broadens and
merges with some of the upper and lower Hubbard peaks. Concomitantly, there is
an increase of charge fluctuations at the impurity site. In contrast to the
single orbital model, some atomic multiplet peaks and exchange split satellites
persist despite strong charge fluctuations. We find that Hund's coupling leads
to a state that may be characterized as an itinerant single atom magnet. As the
filling is increased, the magnetic moment decreases, but the spin freezing
phenomenon persists up to $N\approx 8$. When the hybridization is weak, the
positions of atomic ionization peaks are rather sensitive to shifts of the
impurity on-site energies. This allows to distinguish atomic ionization peaks
from quasiparticle peaks or satellites in the electronic excitation spectra. On
the methodological side we show that a comparison between the spectra obtained
from Monte Carlo and exact diagonalization calculations is possible if the
charge fluctuations are properly adjusted.

thus, controlls the emitted field. The amplitude of the LSP's oscillations can
be kept constant by embedding the system in optical active media. In the case

also the amplitudes of the LSPs remain fixed, leading us, additionally, to

H_2 (0-0) S(1) and S(2) observations with the Spitzer space telescope had
indicated that the warm (~400K) molecular gas in 4C12.50 is made up of a
1.4(+-0.2)x10^8 M_sun ambient reservoir and a 5.2(+-1.7)x10^7 M_sun outflow.
The new CO(1-0) data cube indicates that the corresponding cold (25K) H_2 gas
mass is 1.0(+-0.1)x10^10 M_sun for the ambient medium and <1.3x10^8 M_sun for
the outflow, when using a CO-intensity-to-H_2-mass conversion factor alpha of
0.8 M_sun /(K km/s pc^2). The combined mass outflow rate is high, 230-800
M_sun/yr, but the amount of gas that could escape the galaxy is low. A
potential inflow of gas from a 3.3(+-0.3)x10^8 M_sun tidal tail could moderate
any mass loss. The mass ratio of warm-to-cold molecular gas is >= 30 times
higher in the outflow than in the ambient medium, indicating that a
non-negligible fraction of the accelerated gas is heated to temperatures at
which star formation is inefficient. This conclusion is robust against the use
of different alpha factor values, and/or different warm gas tracers (H_2 vs.
H_2 plus CO): with the CO-probed gas mass being at least 40 times lower at 400K
than at 25K, the total warm-to-cold mass ratio is always lower in the ambient
gas than in the entrained gas. Heating of the molecular gas could facilitate
the detection of new outflows in distant galaxies by enhancing their emission

to recursions where the noise sequence is not a semi-martingale, even though
the limiting noise may be. Our main theorem assumes a weak limit theorem on the
noise process appearing in the random recursions and lifts it to diffusion
approximation for the recursion itself. To achieve this, we approximate the
recursion (pathwise) by the solution to a stochastic equation driven by
piecewise smooth paths; this can be thought of as a pathwise version of
backward error analysis for SDEs. We then identify the limit of this stochastic
equation, and hence the original recursion, using tools from rough path theory.
We provide several examples of diffusion approximations, both new and old, to
illustrate this technique.

operator of the CM model in two different factorized forms -- without spectral

the modification of ${\rm SL}(N,\mathbb C)$-bundles over degenerated elliptic
curve. In view of Symplectic Hecke Correspondence the rational top is related
to the rational spin CM model. Possible applications and generalizations of the
suggested construction are discussed. In particular, the obtained $r$-matrix

over some time period with a frequency higher than the band limit, is not only
very interesting but it also seems to offer many practical applications. The
first reason is that the superoscillation frequency can be exploited to perform
tasks beyond the limits imposed by the lower bandwidth of the signal. The
second reason is that it is generic and applies to any wave form, be it
optical, electrical, sonic, or quantum mechanical. For practical applications,
it is important to overcome two problems. The first problem is that an
overwhelming proportion of the energy goes into the non superoscillating part
of the signal. The second problem is the control of the shape of the
superoscillating part of the signal. The first problem has been recently
addressed by optimization of the super oscillation yield, the ratio of the
energy in the superoscillations to the total energy of the signal. The second
problem may arise when the superoscillation, is to mimic a high frequency
purely perodic signal. This may be required, for example, when a
superoscillating force is to drive a harmonic oscillator at a high resonance
frequency. In this paper the degree of periodicity of a signal is defined and

compress the digital image with scrambling effect. Second, Arnold

m\'etallurgiques et l'agglom\'eration lilloise. La contribution des
diff\'erentes voies d'exposition varie sensiblement d'un polluant \`a l'autre.
Les cartes d'exposition ainsi obtenues permettent d'identifier les zones
g\'eographiques dans lesquelles conduire en priorit\'e des \'etudes

  Analysis of the association between the environment and health has become a
major public health concern, as shown by the development of two national
environmental health plans. For such an analysis, policy-makers need tools to
identify the geographic areas where overexposure to toxic agents may be
observed. The objective of the SIGFRIED 1 project is to build a work station
for spatial modeling of the exposure of the French population to chemical
substances and for identifying the determinants of this exposure. Probabilistic
multimedia modeling is used to assess exposure. The epistemological problems
associated with the absence of data are overcome by the implementation of tools
that apply spatial analysis techniques. An example is furnished for the region
of Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Picardie, for cadmium, nickel and lead exposure. The
calculation of exposure is performed for duration of 70 years on the basis of
data collected around 2004 fora grid of squares 1 km in length. For example,
for Nord-Pas-de-Calais, the indicators allow us to define two areas for cadmium
and three for lead. They are linked to the region's industrial history: mining
basin, metallurgy activities, and the Lille metropolitan area. The contribution
of various exposure pathways varied substantially from one pollutant to
another. The exposure maps thus obtained allow us to identify the geographic
area where environmental studies must be conducted in priority. The GIS thus
constructed is the foundation of a workstation where source emission data,
environmental exposure measurements, and finally health and socioeconomic
measurements can be combined.
