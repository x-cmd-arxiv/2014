zone is a power law of exponent 2.1, similar to a value of 1.87 inferred from
observations of the length distribution of wear products (gouge) in natural and

emissions observed in laboratory experiments on porous sedimentary rocks, are
identified as correlated trails or cascades of local ruptures that emerge from
the stress redistribution process. As the system approaches macroscopic failure
consecutive bursts become progressively more correlated. Their size
distribution is also a power law, with an equivalent Gutenberg-Richter b-value
of 1.22 averaged over the whole test, ranging from 3 down to 0.5 at the time of

astrophysical problems. In this work the effect of magnetic shear on the growth
rate of the MRT instability is investigated. The eigenmodes of an interface and
a slab model under the presence of gravity are analytically calculated assuming
that the orientation of the magnetic field changes in the equilibrium, i.e.,
there is magnetic shear. We solve the linearised magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
equations in the incompressible regime.We find that the growth rate is bounded
under the presence of magnetic shear. We have derived simple analytical
expressions for the maximum growth rate, corresponding to the most unstable
mode of the system. These expressions provide the explicit dependence of the
growth rate on the various equilibrium parameters. For small angles the growth
time is linearly proportional to the shear angle, and in this regime the single
interface problem and the slab problem tend to the same result. On the
contrary, in the limit of large angles and for the interface problem the growth
time is essentially independent of the shear angle. In this regime we have also
been able to calculate an approximate expression for the growth time for the
slab configuration. Magnetic shear can have a strong effect on the growth rates
of the instability. As an application of the results found in this paper we
have indirectly determined the shear angle in solar prominence threads using
their lifetimes and the estimation of the Alfv\'en speed of the structure.

other hand, if on mere phenomenological grounds we replace the ${\dot H}$
dependence of the effective DE density with a linear term $H$ without including
a constant additive term, we find that the transition from deceleration to
acceleration becomes possible but the recent structure formation data strongly
disfavors this cosmological scenario. Finally, we briefly compare the
entropic-force models with some related DE models (based on dynamical vacuum
energy) which overcome these difficulties and are compatible with the present

of TW Hydrae has been a subject of debate. Modeling the disk with data obtained
at different wavelengths has led to a variety of proposed disk structures.
Rather than being inconsistent, the individual models might point to the
different faces of physical processes going on in disks, such as dust growth
and planet formation. Our aim is to investigate the structure of the transition
disk again and to find to what extent we can reconcile apparent model
differences. A large set of high-angular-resolution data was collected from
near-infrared to centimeter wavelengths. We investigated the existing disk
models and established a new self-consistent radiative-transfer model. A
genetic fitting algorithm was used to automatize the parameter fitting. Simple
disk models with a vertical inner rim and a radially homogeneous dust
composition from small to large grains cannot reproduce the combined data set.
Two modifications are applied to this simple disk model: (1) the inner rim is
smoothed by exponentially decreasing the surface density in the inner ~3 AU,
and (2) the largest grains (>100 um) are concentrated towards the inner disk
region. Both properties can be linked to fundamental processes that determine
the evolution of protoplanetary disks: the shaping by a possible companion and
the different regimes of dust-grain growth, respectively. The full
interferometric data set from near-infrared to centimeter wavelengths requires
a revision of existing models for the TW Hya disk. We present a new model that
incorporates the characteristic structures of previous models but deviates in
two key aspects: it does not have a sharp edge at 4 AU, and the surface density
of large grains differs from that of smaller grains. This is the first
successful radiative-transfer-based model for a full set of interferometric
data.

rapidly as function of q reflecting the fact that the spin density is very

for stochastic kinetic models. Whilst it is possible to work directly with the
resulting Markov jump process, computational cost can be prohibitive for
networks of realistic size and complexity. In this paper, we consider an
inference scheme based on a novel hybrid simulator that classifies reactions as
either ""fast"" or ""slow"" with fast reactions evolving as a continuous Markov
process whilst the remaining slow reaction occurrences are modelled through a
Markov jump process with time dependent hazards. A linear noise approximation
(LNA) of fast reaction dynamics is employed and slow reaction events are
captured by exploiting the ability to solve the stochastic differential
equation driving the LNA. This simulation procedure is used as a proposal
mechanism inside a particle MCMC scheme, thus allowing Bayesian inference for
the model parameters. We apply the scheme to a simple application and compare
the output with an existing hybrid approach and also a scheme for performing
inference for the underlying discrete stochastic model.

the Itoiz reservoir to estimate the near-source, surface 3D
displacement-gradients and dynamic deformations. The seismic data were obtained
by a semi-permanent broadband and accelerometric network located on surface and
at underground sites. The dynamic deformation field was calculated by two
different methodologies. First, by the Seismo-Geodetic method using the data
from a three-station micro-array located close to the dam; second, by
Single-Station estimates of the displacement gradients. The dynamic
deformations obtained from both methods were compared and analyzed in the
context of the local free-field effects. The shallow 1D velocity structure was
estimated from the seismic data by modeling the body wave travel times. Time
histories obtained from both methods results quite similar in the time-window
of body-wave arrivals. The strain misfits between methods vary from 1.4% to
35.0% and rotational misfits vary from 2.5% to 36.0%. Amplitudes of
displacement gradients vary in the range of 10-8 to 10-7 strains. From these
results, a new scaling analysis by numerical modeling is proposed in order to
estimate the peak dynamic deformations for different magnitudes, up to the
expected maximum MW in the region (M5.5). Peak dynamic deformations due to
local MW5.5 earthquakes would reach amplitudes of 10-5 strain and 10-3 radians
at the Itoiz dam. The Single-Station method shows to be an adequate option for
the analysis of local seismicity, where few three-component stations are
available. The results obtained here could help to extend the applicability of
these methodologies to other sites of engineering interest.

summarized through the following law, $n+\tilde n = -4$, where $n$ and $\tilde
n$ are respectively the power law indices of the one-dimensional energy and
helicity spectra. We investigate this rotating turbulence problem in the small
Rossby number limit by using the asymptotic weak turbulence theory derived
previously. We show that the empirical law is an exact solution of the helicity
equation where the power law indices correspond to perpendicular (to the
rotation axis) wave number spectra. It is proposed that when the cascade
towards small-scales tends to be dominated by the helicity flux the solution
tends to $\tilde n = -2$, whereas it is $\tilde n = -3/2$ when the energy flux
dominates. The latter solution is compatible with the so-called maximal
helicity state previously observed numerically and derived theoretically in the
weak turbulence regime when only the energy equation is used, whereas the
former solution is constrained by a locality condition.

quantum bounce which occurs when the energy density of the matter field
approaches a universal maximum close to the Planck density. Though the bounce
has been exhibited in various matter models, due to severe computational
challenges some important questions have so far remained unaddressed. These
include the demonstration of the bounce for widely spread states, its detailed
properties for the states when matter field probes regions close to the Planck
volume and the reliability of the continuum effective spacetime description in
general. In this manuscript we rigorously answer these questions using the
Chimera numerical scheme for the isotropic spatially flat model sourced with a
massless scalar field. We show that as expected from an exactly solvable model,
the quantum bounce is a generic feature of states even with a very wide spread,
and for those which bounce much closer to the Planck volume. We perform a
detailed analysis of the departures from the effective description and find
some expected, and some surprising results. At a coarse level of description,
the effective dynamics can be regarded as a good approximation to the
underlying quantum dynamics unless the states correspond to small scalar field
momenta, in which case they bounce closer to the Planck volume, or are very
widely spread. Quantifying the amount of discrepancy between the quantum and
the effective dynamics, we find that the departure between them depends in a
subtle and non-monotonic way on the field momentum and different fluctuations.
Interestingly, the departures are generically found to be such that the
effective dynamics overestimates the spacetime curvature, and underestimates
the volume at the bounce.

but it occurs with a characteristic time scale of a Hubble time. Thus redshift
observations with a challenging precision of $10^{-9}$ require a 10 year time

approaches to address this challenge, potentially requiring less observer time
and having greater immunity to common systematics. On the theoretical side we
explore allowing the universe, rather than the observer, to provide long time
spans; speculative methods include radial baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic
pulsars, and strongly lensed quasars. On the experimental side, we explore
beating down the redshift precision using differential interferometric
techniques, including externally dispersed interferometers and spatial
heterodyne spectroscopy. Low-redshift emission line galaxies are identified as
having high cosmology leverage and systematics control, with an 8 hour exposure
on a 10-meter telescope (1000 hours of exposure on a 40-meter telescope)
potentially capable of measuring the redshift of a galaxy to a precision of
$10^{-8}$ (few $\times 10^{-10}$). Low-redshift redshift drift also has very
strong complementarity with cosmic microwave background measurements, with the
combination achieving a dark energy figure of merit of nearly 300 (1400) for 5%

surrounding the nucleus and the presence of inflowing gas. The gas falls into
the nucleus with an inflow rate of $\le$ 1.2 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, inside a

smaller, suggesting that the inflow can be triggering a nuclear starburst. From

rational agents. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma in particular has become a
standard model for studying cooperation and cheating, with cooperation often
emerging as a robust outcome in evolving populations. Here we extend
evolutionary game theory by allowing players' strategies as well as their
payoffs to evolve in response to selection on heritable mutations. In nature,
many organisms engage in mutually beneficial interactions, and individuals may
seek to change the ratio of risk to reward for cooperation by altering the
resources they commit to cooperative interactions. To study this, we construct
a general framework for the co-evolution of strategies and payoffs in arbitrary
iterated games. We show that, as payoffs evolve, a trade-off between the
benefits and costs of cooperation precipitates a dramatic loss of cooperation
under the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma; and eventually to evolution away from
the Prisoner's Dilemma altogether. The collapse of cooperation is so extreme
that the average payoff in a population may decline, even as the potential
payoff for mutual cooperation increases. Our work offers a new perspective on
the Prisoner's Dilemma and its predictions for cooperation in natural
populations; and it provides a general framework to understand the co-evolution

forms estimates of the state using a local Kalman filter. The sensor transmits
quantized information over a packet dropping link to the remote receiver. The
receiver sends packet receipt acknowledgments back to the sensor via an
erroneous feedback communication channel which is itself packet dropping. The
key novelty of this formulation is that the smart sensor decides, at each
discrete time instant, whether to transmit a quantized version of either its
local state estimate or its local innovation. The objective is to design
optimal transmission policies in order to minimize a long term average cost
function as a convex combination of the receiver's expected estimation error
covariance and the energy needed to transmit the packets. The optimal
transmission policy is obtained by the use of dynamic programming techniques.
Using the concept of submodularity, the optimality of a threshold policy in the
case of scalar systems with perfect packet receipt acknowledgments is proved.
Suboptimal solutions and their structural results are also discussed. Numerical
results are presented illustrating the performance of the optimal and
suboptimal transmission policies.

that a lava ocean is present on their hot dayside. Here, we use several
dedicated thermal models to study how observations with NIRSPEC on the JWST
could further confirm and constrain, or reject the atmosphere-free lava ocean
planet model for very hot super-Earths. Using CoRoT-7b as a working case, we
explore the consequences on the phase-curve of a non tidal-locked rotation,
with/without an atmosphere, and for different values of the albedo. We simulate
future observations of the reflected light and thermal emission from CoRoT-7b
with NIRSPEC-JWST and look for detectable signatures, such as time lag, as well
as the possibility to retrieve the latitudinal surface temperature
distribution.
  We demonstrate that we should be able to constrain several parameters after
observations of two orbits (42 h) with a broad range of wavelengths: i)The Bond
albedo is retrieved to within +/- 0.03 in most cases. ii) The lag effect allows
us to retrieve the rotation period within 3 hours for a planet, with rotation
half the orbital period. iii) Any spin period shorter than a limit in the range
30 - 800 h, depending on the thickness of the thermal layer in the soil, would
be detected. iv) The presence of a thick gray atmosphere with a pressure of one
bar, and a specific opacity higher than 1.0E-5 m-2 kg-1 is detectable. v) With
spectra up to 4.5 mu, the latitudinal temperature profile can be retrieved to
within 30 K with a risk of a totally wrong solution in 5 % of the cases. We
conclude that it should thus be possible to distinguish the reference situation

in common with the earlier medium prime function field sieve method \cite{jl}.
To solve discrete logarithms in a finite extension of a finite field $\F$, a
polynomial $h(x) \in \F[x]$ of a special form is constructed with an
irreducible factor $g(x) \in \F[x]$ of the desired degree. The special form of
$h(x)$ is then exploited in generating multiplicative relations that hold in
the residue class ring $\F[x]/h(x)\F[x]$ hence also in the target residue class
field $\F[x]/g(x)\F[x]$. An interesting question in this context and addressed
in this paper is: when and how does a set of relations on the residue class
ring determine the discrete logarithms in the finite fields contained in it? We
give necessary and sufficient conditions for a set of relations on the residue
class ring to determine discrete logarithms in the finite fields contained in
it. We also present efficient algorithms to derive discrete logarithms from the
relations when the conditions are met. The derived necessary conditions allow
us to clearly identify structural obstructions intrinsic to the special
polynomial $h(x)$ in each of the aforementioned methods, and propose
modifications to the selection of $h(x)$ so as to avoid obstructions.

artifical life and robotics. We shall focus on the lack of recognition of
co-evolution at the heart of these approaches. We propose to explicitly
integrate the evolution of the environment into our approach in order to refine
the ontogenesis of the artificial system, and to compare it with the enaction
paradigm. The growing complexity of the ontogenetic mechanisms to be activated
can therefore be compensated by an interactive guidance system emanating from
the environment. This proposition does not however resolve that of the
relevance of the meaning created by the machine (sense-making). Such
reflections lead us to integrate human interaction into this environment in
order to construct relevant meaning in terms of participative artificial
intelligence. This raises a number of questions with regards to setting up an
enactive interaction. The article concludes by exploring a number of issues,
thereby enabling us to associate current approaches with the principles of
morphogenesis, guidance, the phenomenology of interactions and the use of
minimal enactive interfaces in setting up experiments which will deal with the
problem of artificial intelligence in a variety of enaction-based ways.

another in everyday scientific praxis. But this praxis has little philosophical
justification, since there exist many notions of simplicity, and those that can
be defined precisely strongly depend on the language in which the theory is
formulated. The language dependence is a natural feature - to some extent - but
it is also believed to be a fatal problem, because, according to a common
general argument, the simplicity of a theory is always trivial in a suitably
chosen language. But, this trivialization argument is typically either applied
to toy-models of scientific theories or applied with little regard for the
empirical content of the theory. This paper shows that the trivialization
argument fails, when one considers realistic theories and requires their
empirical content to be preserved. In fact, the concepts that enable a very
simple formulation, are not necessarily measurable, in general. Moreover, the
inspection of a theory describing a chaotic billiard shows that precisely those
concepts that naturally make the theory extremely simple are provably not
measurable. This suggests that - whenever a theory possesses sufficiently
complex consequences - the constraint of measurability prevents too simple
formulations in any language. This explains why the scientists often regard
their assessments of simplicity as largely unambiguous. In order to reveal a
cultural bias in the scientists' assessment, one should explicitly identify
different characterizations of simplicity of the assumptions that lead to
different theory selections. General arguments are not sufficient.

team-based approach focused on delivering more streamlined care to patients. In
current practices of medical homes, a clinical-based prediction frame is
recommended because it can help match the portfolio capacity of PCMH teams with
the actual load generated by a set of patients. Without such balances in
clinical supply and demand, issues such as excessive under and over utilization
of physicians, long waiting time for receiving the appropriate treatment, and
non-continuity of care will eliminate many advantages of the medical home
strategy. In this paper, by extending the hierarchical generalized linear model
to include multivariate responses, we develop a clinical workload prediction
model for care portfolio demands in a Bayesian framework. The model allows for
heterogeneous variances and unstructured covariance matrices for nested random
effects that arise through complex hierarchical care systems. We show that
using a multivariate approach substantially enhances the precision of workload
predictions at both primary and non-primary care levels. We also demonstrate
that care demands depend not only on patient demographics but also on other
utilization factors, such as length of stay. Our analyses of a recent data from
Veteran Health Administration further indicate that risk adjustment for patient
health conditions can considerably improve the prediction power of the model.

order of one-loop, octet and decuplet intermediaries states. We obtain

corrections come from Feynman diagrams, then talk about a broken chiral
symmetry in the implicit limit $m_q \rightarrow 0$, where $m_q$ is the quark

in that case the SU(3) symmetry breaking a first-order perturbation is

spatial components of the axial operator between the states of the spin flavor
symmetry, give the typical values of the axial vector coupling. For the baryon
octet, links axial vector are $g_A$, just as they are defined in experiments of
baryon semileptonic decays, where $g_A \approx 1.27$ for neutron beta decay. In
strong decays of the baryon axial vector couplings are $g$, which are extracted
from the widths of the strong decays of baryon decuplet to octet of baryons and

efficiently convert the kinetic energy (in sufficiently hot environments) of
dark matter into e+e- pairs. The standard scenario invokes a doublet of nearly
degenerate DM states, and a dark force to mediate a large upscattering cross
section between the two. For heavy ($\sim TeV$) DM, the kinetic energy of WIMPs
in large (galaxy-sized or larger) halos is capable of producing low-energy
positrons. For lighter dark matter, this is kinematically impossible, and the
unique observable signature becomes an X-ray line, arising from $\chi \chi
\rightarrow \chi^* \chi^*$, followed by $\chi^* \rightarrow \chi \gamma$. This
variant of XDM is distinctive from other DM X-ray scenarios in that it tends to
be most present in more massive, hotter environments, such as clusters, rather
than nearby dwarfs, and has different dependencies from decaying models. We
find that it is capable of explaining the recently reported X-ray line at 3.56
keV. For very long lifetimes of the excited state, primordial decays can
explain the signal without the presence of upscattering. Thermal models
freeze-out as in the normal XDM setup, via annihilations to the light boson
$\phi$. For suitable masses the annihilation $\chi \chi \rightarrow \phi \phi$
followed by $\phi \rightarrow SM$ can explain the reported gamma-ray signature
from the galactic center. Direct detection is discussed, including the
possibility of explaining DAMA via the ""Luminous"" dark matter approach. Quite
generally, the proximity of the 3.56 keV line to the energy scale of DAMA
motivates a reexamination of electromagnetic explanations. Other signals,
including lepton jets and the modification of cores of dwarf galaxies are also
considered.

introduce such a universal model that employs a $d$-dimensional ancillary
qudit. The ancilla-register interactions take the form of controlled
displacements operators, with a displacement operator defined on the periodic
and discrete lattice phase space of a qudit. We show that these interactions
can implement controlled phase gates on the register by utilising geometric
phases that are created when closed loops are traversed in this phase space.
The extra degrees of freedom of the ancilla can be harnessed to reduce the
number of operations required for certain gate sequences. In particular, we see
that the computational advantages of the quantum bus (qubus) architecture,
which employs a field-mode ancilla, are also applicable to this model. We then
explore an alternative ancilla-mediated model which employs a spin-ensemble as
the ancillary system and again the interactions with the register qubits are
via controlled displacement operators, with a displacement operator defined on
the Bloch sphere phase space of the spin coherent states of the ensemble. We
discuss the computational advantages of this model and its relationship with
the qubus architecture.

allocation at a sensor equipped with energy harvesting technology for remote
state estimation of linear stochastic dynamical systems. In this framework, the
sensor measurements as noisy versions of the system states are sent to the
receiver over a packet dropping communication channel. The packet dropout
probabilities of the channel depend on both the sensor's transmission energies
and time varying wireless fading channel gains. The sensor has access to an
energy harvesting source which is an everlasting but unreliable energy source
compared to conventional batteries with fixed energy storages. The receiver
performs optimal state estimation with random packet dropouts to minimize the
estimation error covariances based on received measurements. The receiver also
sends packet receipt acknowledgments to the sensor via an erroneous feedback
communication channel which is itself packet dropping.
  The objective is to design optimal transmission energy allocation at the
energy harvesting sensor to minimize either a finite-time horizon sum or a long
term average (infinite-time horizon) of the trace of the expected estimation
error covariance of the receiver's Kalman filter. These problems are formulated
as Markov decision processes with imperfect state information. The optimal
transmission energy allocation policies are obtained by the use of dynamic
programming techniques. Using the concept of submodularity, the structure of
the optimal transmission energy policies are studied. Suboptimal solutions are
also discussed which are far less computationally intensive than optimal
solutions. Numerical simulation results are presented illustrating the
performance of the energy allocation algorithms.

behavior of isolated supernovae with the superbubbles driven by multiple,
collocated supernovae. Continuous energy injection via successive supernovae
going off within the hot/dilute bubble maintains a strong termination shock.
This strong shock keeps the superbubble over-pressured and drives the outer
shock well after it becomes radiative. Isolated supernovae, in contrast, with
no further energy injection, become radiative quite early ($\lesssim 0.1$ Myr,
10s of pc), and stall at scales $\lesssim 100$ pc. We show that isolated
supernovae lose almost all of their mechanical energy by a Myr, but
superbubbles can retain up to $\sim 40\%$ of the input energy in form of
mechanical energy over the lifetime of the star cluster (few 10s of Myr). These
conclusions hold even in the presence of realistic magnetic fields and thermal
conduction. We also compare various recipes for implementing supernova feedback
in numerical simulations. For various feedback prescriptions we derive the
spatial scale below which the energy needs to be deposited for it to couple to
the interstellar medium (ISM). We show that a steady thermal wind within the

smaller clusters we expect multiple internal shocks instead of a smooth, dense

extremely deep surveys, probing very small areas. As a consequence, candidates
are very faint, making spectroscopic confirmation practically impossible. In
order to overcome such limitations, we have undertaken the CF-HiZELS survey,
which is a large area, medium depth near infrared narrow-band survey targeted
at $z=8.8$ Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emitters (LAEs) and covering 10 deg$^2$
in part of the SSA22 field with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We surveyed
a comoving volume of $4.7\times 10^6$ Mpc$^3$ to a Ly$\alpha$ luminosity limit
of $6.3\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We look for Ly$\alpha$ candidates by
applying the following criteria: i) clear emission line source, ii) no optical
detections ($ugriz$ from CFHTLS), iii) no visible detection in the optical
stack ($ugriz > 27$), iv) visually checked reliable NB$_J$ and $J$ detections
and v) $J-K \leq 0$. We compute photometric redshifts and remove a significant
amount of dusty lower redshift line-emitters at $z \sim 1.4 $ or $2.2$. A total
of 13 Ly$\alpha$ candidates were found, of which two are marked as strong
candidates, but the majority have very weak constraints on their SEDs. Using
follow-up observations with SINFONI/VLT we are able to exclude the most robust
candidates as Ly$\alpha$ emitters. We put a strong constraint on the Ly$\alpha$
luminosity function at $z \sim 9$ and make realistic predictions for ongoing
and future surveys. Our results show that surveys for the highest redshift LAEs
are susceptible of multiple contaminations and that spectroscopic follow-up is
absolutely necessary.

with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The evidence for spectral features depends on
eclipse depth uncertainties. Spitzer has proven capable of eclipse precisions
better than 1E-4 when multiple eclipses are analyzed simultaneously, but this
feat has only been performed four times. It is harder to self-calibrate
photometry when a single occultation is reduced and analyzed in isolation; we
find that such measurements have not passed the test of repeatability.
Single-eclipse measurements either have an uncertainty floor of 5E-4, or their
uncertainties have been underestimated by a factor of 3. If one adopts these
empirical uncertainties for single-eclipse measurements, then the evidence for
molecular features all but disappears: blackbodies have better BIC than
spectral retrieval for all planets, save HD 189733b, and the few planets poorly
fit by blackbodies are also poorly fit by self-consistent radiative transfer
models. This suggests that the features in extant broadband emission spectra
are due to astrophysical and instrumental noise rather than molecular bands.
Claims of stratospheric inversions, disequilibrium chemistry, and high C/O
ratios based solely on photometry are premature. We recommend that observers be
cautious of error estimates from self-calibration of small data sets, and that
modelers compare the evidence for spectral models to that of simpler models

limit the GC size in the galaxy halo regions to rh~2 pc. We suggest that this
may be realized by an exotic GC orbit distribution function, an extended dark
matter halo, and/or tidal stress induced by the increased stochasticity in the
dwarf halo substructure at larger Rgal. We match our GC rh measurements with

conjecture for sheaves over abelian surfaces were studied. A third version is
considered here. In the current setup, the isomorphism involves moduli spaces
of sheaves with fixed determinant and fixed determinant of the Fourier-Mukai
transform on one side, and moduli spaces where both determinants vary, on the
other side. We first establish the isomorphism in rank one using the
representation theory of Heisenberg groups. For product abelian surfaces, the
isomorphism is then shown to hold for sheaves with fiber degree 1 via
Fourier-Mukai techniques. By degeneration to product geometries, the duality is
obtained generically for a large number of numerical types. Finally, it is
shown in great generality that the Verlinde sheaves encoding the variation of
the spaces of theta functions are locally free over moduli.

chirality of these modes can be probed experimentally by measuring the

high-time-resolution measurements of the full (linear and circular)
polarization of the Crab pulsar. Taken at a resolution of 1/8192 of the 34-ms
pulse period (i.e., $4.1~\mu{\rm s}$), the 1.38-GHz linear-polarization
measurements are in general agreement with previous lower-time-resolution
1.4-GHz measurements of linear polarization in the main pulse (MP), in the
interpulse (IP), and in the low-frequency component (LFC). We find the MP and
IP to be linearly polarized at about $24\%$ and $21\%$, with no discernible
difference in polarization position angle. However, and contrary to theoretical
expectations and measurements in the visible, we find no evidence for
significant variation (sweep) in polarization position angle over the MP, the
IP, or the LFC. Although, the main pulse exhibits a small but statistically
significant quadratic variation in the degree of linear polarization. We
discuss the implications which appear to be in contradiction to theoretical
expectations. In addition, we detect weak circular polarization in the main
pulse and interpulse, and strong ($\approx 20\%$) circular polarization in the
low-frequency component, which also exhibits very strong ($\approx 98\%$)
linear polarization at a position angle about $40\degree$ from that of the MP
or IP. The pulse-mean polarization properties are consistent with the LFC being
a low-altitude component and the MP and IP being high-altitude caustic
components. Nevertheless, current models for the MP and IP emission do not
readily account for the observed absence of pronounced polarization changes
across the pulse. Finally, we measure IP and LFC pulse phases relative to the
MP that are consistent with recent measurements, which have shown that the
phases of these pulse components are evolving with time.

is introduced in the system however, stable fixed points are found for some
specific types of interaction between the ELKO field and matter. Although the
parameter $\delta$ is related to an unknown potential, in order to satisfy the

particles are constructed, in which each particle has a `type', typically
recording both spatial position and genetic type, and a level. For finite
intensity models, the levels are distributed on $[0,\lambda ]$, whereas in the
infinite intensity limit $\lambda\rightarrow\infty$, at each time $t$, the
joint distribution of types and levels is conditionally Poisson, with mean
measure $\Xi (t)\times \ell$ where $\ell$ denotes Lebesgue measure and $\Xi
(t)$ is a measure-valued population process. The time-evolution of the levels
captures the genealogies of the particles in the population.
  Key forces of ecology and genetics can be captured within this common
framework. Models covered incorporate both individual and event based births
and deaths, one-for-one replacement, immigration, independent `thinning' and
independent or exchangeable spatial motion and mutation of individuals. Since
birth and death probabilities can depend on type, they also include natural
selection. The primary goal of the paper is to present particle-with-level or
lookdown constructions for each of these elements of a population model. Then
the elements can be combined to specify the desired model. In particular, a
non-trivial extension of the spatial $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot process is
constructed.

D(EF) arising from Co 3d bands. At 1.8 K the M(H) data for H|| c exhibit a
well-defined first-order spin-flop transition at an applied field of 3.5 T. The
small ordered moment of 0.3 muB/Co obtained from the M(H) data at low T, the
large exchange enhancement of chi and the lack of a self-consistent

extended emission at 4.5 $\mu$m, which likely traces outflows from massive
young stellar objects (MYSOs). Our objectives are to determine the
milliarcsecond (mas) morphology of the maser emission and to examine if it
comes from one or several candidate MIR counterparts in the clusters of MYSOs.
The European VLBI Network (EVN) was used to image the 6.7 GHz maser line with
~2.'1 field of view toward 14 maser sites from the Torun catalog.
Quasi-simultaneous observations were carried out with the Torun 32 m telescope.
We obtained maps with mas angular resolution that showed diversity of methanol
emission morphology: a linear distribution (e.g., G37.753-00.189), a ring-like
(G40.425+00.700), and a complex one (e.g., G45.467+00.053). The maser emission
is usually associated with the strongest MIR counterpart in the clusters; no
maser emission was detected from other MIR sources in the fields of view of
2.'1 in diameter. The maser source luminosity seems to correlate with the total
luminosity of the central MYSO. Although the Very Long Baseline Interferometry
(VLBI) technique resolves a significant part of the maser emission, the
morphology is still well determined. This indicates that the majority of maser
components have compact cores.

matter systems. Recently, synthetic gauge fields have been realized
experimentally in neutral cold atom systems, giving rise to a spin-orbit
coupling term with ""strength"" $k_{\text{so}}$. This paper investigates the
interplay between the single-particle spin-orbit coupling term of Rashba type
and the short-range two-body $s$-wave interaction for cold atoms under external
confinement. Specifically, we consider two different harmonically trapped
two-atom systems. The first system consists of an atom with spin-orbit coupling
that interacts with a structureless particle through a short-range two-body
potential. The second system consists of two atoms that both feel the
spin-orbit coupling term and that interact through a short-range two-body
potential. Treating the spin-orbit term perturbatively, we determine the
correction to the ground state energy for various generic parameter
combinations. Selected excited states are also treated. An important aspect of
our study is that the perturbative treatment is not limited to small $s$-wave
scattering lengths but provides insights into the system behavior over a wide
range of scattering lengths, including the strongly-interacting unitary regime.
Our perturbative results are confirmed by numerical calculations that expand
the eigenfunctions of the two-particle Hamiltonian in terms of basis functions
that contain explicitly correlated Gaussians.

quasars, with the emphasis on the kinematic structure of the [OIII]5007
emission line. [OIII] emission tends to show blueshifts and blue excess, which
indicates that at least part of the narrow-line gas is undergoing an organized
outflow. The velocity width containing 90% of line power ranges from 370 to
4780 km/sec, suggesting outflow velocities up to 2000 km/sec. The velocity
width of the [OIII] emission is positively correlated with the radio luminosity
among the radio-quiet quasars. We propose that radio emission in radio-quiet
quasars is due to relativistic particles accelerated in the shocks within the
quasar-driven outflows; star formation in quasar hosts is insufficient to
explain the observed radio emission. The median radio luminosity of the sample
of nu L_nu[1.4GHz] = 10^40 erg/sec suggests a median kinetic luminosity of the
quasar-driven wind of L_wind=3x10^44 erg/sec, or about 4% of the estimated
median bolometric luminosity L_bol=8x10^45 erg/sec. Furthermore, the velocity
width of [OIII] is positively correlated with mid-infrared luminosity, which
suggests that outflows are ultimately driven by the radiative output of the
quasar. As the outflow velocity increases, some emission lines characteristic
of shocks in quasi-neutral medium increase as well, which we take as further
evidence of quasar-driven winds propagating into the interstellar medium of the
host galaxy. None of the kinematic components show correlations with the
stellar velocity dispersions of the host galaxies, so there is no evidence that
any of the gas in the narrow-line region of quasars is in dynamical equilibrium
with the host galaxy. Quasar feedback appears to operate above the threshold
luminosity of L_bol=3x10^45 erg/sec.

the odd-parity modes is presented. Expanding the Horndeski action to second
order in perturbations and eliminating auxiliary variables, we derive the
quadratic action for even-parity perturbations written solely in terms of two
dynamical variables. The two perturbations can be interpreted as the
gravitational and scalar waves. Correspondingly, we obtain two conditions to
evade ghosts and two conditions for the absence of gradient instabilities. Only
one in each pair of conditions yields a new stability criterion, as the
conditions derived from the stability of the gravitational-wave degree of
freedom coincide with those in the odd-parity sector. Similarly, the
propagation speed of one of the two modes is the same as that for the
odd-parity mode, while the other differs in general from them. Our result is
applicable to all the theories of gravitation with an extra single scalar
degree of freedom such as the Brans-Dicke theory, $f(R)$ models, and Galileon

only enhances nonlinear response of neuronal networks, but also improves the
synchronization of the response to the signal. We reveal this phenomenon in
neuronal networks that are in a dynamical state near a saddle-node bifurcation
corresponding to appearance of sustained network oscillations. In this state,
even a weak periodic signal can evoke sharp nonlinear oscillations of neuronal
activity. These sharp network oscillations have a deterministic form and
amplitude determined by nonlinear dynamical equations. The signal-to-noise
ratio reaches a maximum at an optimum level of sensory noise, manifesting
stochastic resonance (SR) at the population level. We demonstrate SR by use of
simulations and numerical integration of rate equations in a cortical model
with stochastic neurons. Using this model, we mimic the experiments of Gluckman
et al. [B. J. Gluckman et al, Phys. Rev. Lett., v. 77, 4098 (1996)] that have
given evidence of SR in mammalian brain. We also study neuronal networks in
which neurons are grouped in modules and every module works in the regime of
SR. We find that even a few modules can strongly enhance the reliability of
signal detection in comparison with the case when a modular organization is

increased by one order of magnitude, as the Dirac point is moved from Brillouin
zone boundary to Brillouin zone center and the real-space distribution of Dirac
states are made twice more delocalized. These intriguing changes are explained
by an orbital filtering effect of edge H atoms, which removes certain
components of $p$ orbits of edge Bi atoms that reshapes the topological edge
states. In addition, the spin texture of the Dirac states is also modified,
which is described by introducing an effective Hamiltonian. Our findings not

GeV, of the order of the weak scale $M_{W}$, is calculable as a finite value in
the scnenario of gauge-Higgs unification. In the scenario formulated on a flat
5-dimensional space-time, the Higgs mass is calculable, being protected under
the quantum correction by gauge invariance, though the predicted Higgs mass is
generally too small compared with $M_{W}$. In the 6-dimensional SU(3) model,
however, a suitable orbifolding is known to lead to a mass of the order of
$M_{W}$: $M_{H} = 2M_{W}$ at the tree level, which has some similarity to the
corresponding prediction by the MSSM, $M_{H}$ leq (cos beta) $M_{Z}$. We
demonstrate first by a general argument and secondly by explicit calculations
that, even though the quantum correction to the quartic self-coupling of the
Higgs field is UV-divergent, its deviation from that of $g^{2}$ is calculable,
and therefore two observables, $M_{H}^{2}$ and Delta equiv
$(M_{H}/2M_{W})^{2}-1$, are both calculable in the gauge-Higgs unification

the acceleration noise and readout dynamic range limitations of traditional
electrostatic accelerometers. It has the potential of achieving acceleration
noise performance of drag-free systems over a restricted frequency band without
the need for external drag-free control or spacecraft propulsion. Like
traditional accelerometers, the drift mode accelerometer contains a
high-density test mass surrounded by an electrode housing, which can control
and sense all six degrees of freedom of the test mass. Unlike traditional
accelerometers, the suspension system is operated with a low duty cycle so that
the limiting suspension force noise only acts over brief, known time intervals,
which can be neglected in the data analysis. The readout is performed using a
laser interferometer which is immune to the dynamic range limitations of even
the best voltage references typically used to determine the inertial
acceleration of electrostatic accelerometers. The drift mode accelerometer is
related to the like-named operational mode of the LISA Pathfinder spacecraft,
which will be used to estimate the acceleration noise associated with the LISA
Pathfinder front end electronics. This paper describes operation of such a
device, develops models for its performance with respect to satellite geodesy
and gravitational wave astrophysics applications, and discusses methods for
testing its performance using torsion pendula in the laboratory and the LISA
Pathfinder mission in space.

Kondo insulators (TKIs) have also been theoretically predicted. The latter has
ignited revival interest in the properties of Kondo insulators. Currently, the
feasibility of topological nature in SmB$_6$ has been intensively analyzed by
several complementary probes. Here by starting with a minimal-orbital Anderson
lattice model, we explore the local electronic structure in a Kondo insulator.
We show that the two strong topological regimes sandwiching the weak
topological regime give rise to a single Dirac cone, which is located near the
center or corner of the surface Brillouin zone. We further find that, when a
single impurity is placed on the surface, low-energy resonance states are
induced in the weak scattering limit for the strong TKI regimes and the
resonance level moves monotonically across the hybridization gap with the
strength of impurity scattering potential; while low energy states can only be
induced in the unitary scattering limit for the weak TKI regime, where the
resonance level moves universally toward the center of the hybridization gap.
These impurity induced low-energy quasiparticles will lead to characteristic
signatures in scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, which has recently
found success in probing into exotic properties in heavy fermion systems.

state information (CSI) for frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems for backward compatibility. It is
theoretically well known that the codebook size for CSI quantization should be
increased as the number of transmit antennas becomes larger, and 3GPP long term
evolution (LTE) and LTE-Advanced codebooks also follow this trend. Thus, in
massive MIMO, it is hard to apply the conventional approach of using
pre-defined vector-quantized codebooks for CSI quantization mainly because of
codeword search complexity. In this paper, we propose a trellis-extended
codebook (TEC) that can be easily harmonized with current wireless standards
such as LTE or LTE-Advanced by extending standardized codebooks designed for 2,
4, or 8 antennas with trellis structures. TEC exploits a Viterbi decoder and
convolutional encoder in channel coding as the CSI quantizer and the CSI
reconstructer, respectively. By quantizing multiple channel entries
simultaneously using standardized codebooks in a state transition of trellis
search, TEC can achieve fractional bits per channel entry quantization to have
a practical feedback overhead. Thus, TEC can solve both the complexity and the
feedback overhead issues of CSI quantization in massive MIMO systems. We also
develop trellis-extended successive phase adjustment (TE-SPA) which works as a
differential codebook of TEC. This is similar to the dual codebook concept of
LTE-Advanced. TE-SPA can reduce CSI quantization error even with lower feedback
overhead in temporally correlated channels. Numerical results verify the
effectiveness of the proposed schemes in FDD massive MIMO systems.

Earlier works considered only random failures. In practical situations, an

  We study cascading failures in smart grids, where an attacker selectively
compromises the nodes with probabilities proportional to their degrees; high
degree nodes are compromised with higher probability. We mathematically analyze
the sizes of the giant components of the networks under targeted attacks, and
compare the results with the corresponding sizes under random attacks. We show
that networks disintegrate faster for targeted attacks compared to random

disintegrates one or both of the networks, whereas both the networks contain

T-parity after the discovery of Higgs boson. We analyze the relic abundance of
dark matter, focusing on the effects of coannihilaitons with T-odd fermions.
After determining the parameter space that predicts the correct relic abundance
measured by WMAP and Planck collaborations, we evaluate the elastic scattering
cross section between dark matter and nucleon. In comparison with experimental
results, we find that the lower mass of dark matter is constrained mildly by
LUX 2013 while the future XENON experiment has potential to explore most of the
parameter space for both T-odd lepton and T-odd quark coannihilation scenarios.
We also study the collider signatures of T-odd fermion pair production at the
LHC. Even though the production cross sections are large, it turns out very
challenging to search for these T-odd fermions directly at the collider because
the visible charged leptons or jets are very soft. Furthermore, we show that,
with an extra hard jet radiated out from the initial state, the T-odd quark
pair production can contribute significantly to mono-jet plus missing energy
search at the LHC.

approximations of a class of systems with piece-wise continuous functions. By
using techniques from the theory of differential inclusions, the underlying
piece-wise functions can be locally or globally approximated. The approximation
results can be used to model piece-wise continuous-time dynamical systems of
integer or fractional-order. In this way, by overcoming the lack of numerical
methods for diffrential equations of fractional-order with discontinuous
right-hand side, unattainable procedures for systems modeled by this kind of
equations, such as chaos control, synchronization, anticontrol and many others,
can be easily implemented. Several examples are presented and three comparative
applications are studied.

Gravitational lensing based on 1/r^n fall-off metric, as a one-parameter model

(n=2) in the weak field, has been recently studied. Only for n=1 case, however,
it has been explicitly shown that effects of relativistic lens images by the

relativistic images by the strong field can be neglected for n>1 in the
Tangherlini spacetime which is one of the simplest models for our purpose. We
calculate the divergent part of the deflection angle for arbitrary n and the
regular part for n=1, 2 and 4 in the strong field limit, the deflection angle
for arbitrary n under the weak gravitational approximation. We also compare the
radius of the Einstein ring with the radii of the relativistic Einstein rings
for arbitrary n. We conclude that the images in the strong gravitational field
have little effect on the total light curve and that the time-symmetric
demagnification parts in the light curve will appear even after taking account
of the images in the strong gravitational field for n>1.

that long-period charge correlations become dominant when NNN terms are
included, in the charge-frustrated region. The calculated optical excitation
spectra show that the charge transfer excitations in the long-period CO extend
to a lower energy range compared to those in the short-period CO states

  renormalization (semi)group: A pedagogical introduction","30 Pages, 19 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While analyzing second order thermodynamical phase transitions, Lev Landau
(the famous Russian physicist) introduced a very vital concept, the concept of
an ""order parameter"". This not only amalgamated the previous fragmentary
theoretical understanding of phase transitions (an arsenal of mean-field
theories) but also it put forward the important theory of ""spontaneous symmetry
breaking"". Today, order parameter concept is a paradigm both in condensed
matter physics and in high energy physics, and Landau theory is a pinnacle of
all mean-field theories. Mean field theories are good qualitative descriptors
of the phase transition behavior. But all mean-field theories (including
Landau's theory) fail at the critical point (the problem of large correlation
length). The problems with large correlation length in quantum many-body
systems are the hardest problems known in theoretical physics (both in
condensed matter and in particle physics). It was Ken Wilson's physical
insights and his powerful mathematical skills that opened a way to the solution
of such hard problems.
  This manuscript is a perspective on these issues. Starting with simple
examples of phase transitions (like ice/water; diamond/graphite etc.) we
address the following important questions: Why does non-analyticity (sharp
phase transitions) arise when thermodynamical functions (i.e., free energies
etc) are good analytic functions? How does Landau's program unify all the
previous mean-field theories? Why do all the mean-field theories fail near the
critical point? How does Wilson's program go beyond all the mean-field
theories? What is the origin emergence and universality?

experimentally known critical exponents. The traditional argument which explain
this failure of mean-field theories near a critical point is the Ginsburg
criterion in which diverging fluctuations of the order parameter is the root
cause. We argue, contrary to the above mentioned traditional view, that
diverging fluctuations in real physical systems near a critical point are
genuine consequence of the breakdown of the property of statistical
independence, and are faithfully reproduced by the mean-field theory. By
looking at the problem from the point of view of ""statistical independence"" the
divergence of fluctuations in real physical systems near criticality becomes
immediately apparent as a connection can be established between diverging
correlation length and diverging fluctuations. To address the question of why
mean-field theories, much successful qualitatively, fail to reproduce the known
values of critical indices we argue, using the essential ideas of the Wilsonian
renormalization group, that mean-field theories fail to capture the long length
scale averages of an order parameter near a critical point.

made the creation of strongly correlated, and even topologically ordered,
states of photons a real possibility. Many of these states are gapped and
exhibit anyon excitations, which could be used for a robust form of quantum
information processing. However, while numerous qubit array proposals exist to
engineer the Hamiltonian for these systems, the question of how to stabilize
the many-body ground state of these photonic quantum simulators against photon
losses remains largely unanswered. We here propose a simple mechanism which
achieves this goal for abelian and non-abelian fractional quantum Hall states
of light. Our construction uses a uniform two-photon drive field to couple the
qubits of the primary lattice with an auxiliary ``shadow"" lattice, composed of
qubits with a much faster loss rate than the qubits of the primary quantum
simulator itself. This coupling causes hole states created by photon losses to
be rapidly refilled, and the system's many-body gap prevents further photons
from being added once the strongly correlated ground state is reached. The
fractional quantum Hall state (with a small, transient population of quasihole
excitations) is thus the most stable state of the system, and all other
configurations will relax toward it over time. The physics described here could
be implemented in a circuit QED architecture, and the device parameters needed
for our scheme to succeed are in reach of current technology. We also propose a
simple 6 qubit device, which could easily be built in the near future, that can
act as a proof of principle for our scheme.

tightly correlated to the total hydrogen column density which is made up of
atomic (HI) and molecular hydrogen (H$_{2})$. Above a certain column density
threshold, atomic hydrogen turns molecular. We analyse gas and dust properties
of intermediate-velocity clouds (IVCs) in the lower galactic halo to explore
their transition from the atomic to the molecular phase. Driven by
observations, we investigate the physical processes that transform a purely
atomic IVC into a molecular one. Data from the Effelsberg-Bonn HI-Survey
(EBHIS) are correlated to FIR wavebands of the Planck satellite and IRIS.
Modified black-body emission spectra are fitted to deduce dust optical depths
and grain temperatures. We remove the contribution of atomic hydrogen to the
FIR intensity to estimate molecular hydrogen column densities. Two IVCs show
different FIR properties, despite their similarity in HI, such as narrow
spectral lines and large column densities. One FIR bright IVC is associated
with H$_{2}$, confirmed by $^{12}$CO $(1\rightarrow0)$ emission; the other IVC
is FIR dim and shows no FIR excess, which indicates the absence of molecular
hydrogen. We propose that the FIR dim and bright IVCs probe the transition
between the atomic and molecular gas phase. Triggered by dynamical processes,
this transition happens during the descent of IVCs onto the galactic disk. The
most natural driver is ram pressure exerted onto the cloud by the increasing
halo density. Because of the enhanced pressure, the formation timescale of
H$_{2}$ is reduced, allowing the formation of large amounts of H$_{2}$ within a
few Myr.

(large and low-recoil) and independent of any effective Hamiltonian
computation, between the observables $P_i$ and $P_i^{CP}$ of the angular
distribution of the 4-body decay $B \to K^*(\to K\pi) l^+l^-$. These relations
emerge out of the symmetries of the angular distribution. We discuss the
implications of these relations under the (testable) hypotheses of no scalar or
tensor contributions and no New Physics weak phases in the Wilson coefficients.
Under these hypotheses there is a direct relation among the observables
$P_{1}$,$P_2$ and $P_{4,5}^\prime$. This can be used as an independent
consistency test of the measurements of the angular observables. Alternatively,
these relations can be applied directly in the fit to data, reducing the number
of free parameters in the fit. This opens up the possibility to perform a full
angular fit of the observables with existing datasets. An important consequence
of the found relations is that a priori two different measurements, namely the
measured position of the zero ($q_0^2$) of the forward-backward asymmetry
$A_{FB}$ and the value of $P_5^\prime$ evaluated at this same point, are
related by $P_4^2(q_0^{2})+P_5^2(q_0^{2})=1$. Under the hypotheses of real
Wilson coefficients and $P_4^\prime$ being SM-like, we show that the higher the
position of $q_0^{2}$ the smaller should be the value of $P_5^\prime$ evaluated
at the same point. A precise determination of the position of the zero of
$A_{FB}$ together with a measurement of $P_4^\prime$ (and $P_1$) at this
position can be used as an independent experimental test of the anomaly in
$P_5^\prime$. We also point out the existence of upper and lower bounds for
$P_1$, namely $P_5^{\prime 2}-1 \leq P_1 \leq 1-P_4^{\prime 2}$, which
constraints the physical region of the observables.

the same order, spectral densities in the bulk are well approximated by a
Gaussian function which is typical behaviour for many-body models with
short-range interactions. The main part of the paper is devoted to the
investigation of a different characteristic case when spectral densities have
peaks related with strong degeneracies of unperturbed states in certain limits
of coupling constants. In the strict limit $N\to\infty$, peaks overlap and
disappear but for values of $N$ accessible in numerical calculations they often
strongly influence spectral densities and other quantities as well. A simple
method is developed which permits to find general approximation formulae for
multi-peak structure of spectral density in good agreement with numerics.

and harmonic frequencies. In this paper, we present a robust and
computationally efficient algorithm for removing power line interference from
neural recordings. The algorithm includes four steps. First, an adaptive notch
filter is used to estimate the fundamental frequency of the interference.
Subsequently, based on the estimated frequency, harmonics are generated by
using discrete-time oscillators, and then the amplitude and phase of each
harmonic are estimated through using a modified recursive least squares
algorithm. Finally, the estimated interference is subtracted from the recorded
data. The algorithm does not require any reference signal, and can track the
frequency, phase, and amplitude of each harmonic. When benchmarked with other
popular approaches, our algorithm performs better in terms of noise immunity,
convergence speed, and output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While minimally
affecting the signal bands of interest, the algorithm consistently yields fast
convergence and substantial interference rejection in different conditions of
interference strengths (input SNR from -30 dB to 30 dB), power line frequencies
(45-65 Hz), and phase and amplitude drifts. In addition, the algorithm features
a straightforward parameter adjustment since the parameters are independent of
the input SNR, input signal power, and the sampling rate. The proposed
algorithm features a highly robust operation, fast adaptation to interference
variations, significant SNR improvement, low computational complexity and
memory requirement, and straightforward parameter adjustment. These features
render the algorithm suitable for wearable and implantable sensor applications,
where reliable and real-time cancellation of the interference is desired.

cosmologies filled with a tilted $\gamma$-fluid undergoing velocity diffusion
on a scalar field. We determine the future attractors and investigate the
late-time behaviour of the models. We find that at late times the normalized
energy density $\Omega$ tends to zero, while the scalar potential $\Phi$
approaches 1 and dominates the evolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that in
presence of diffusion fluids with $\gamma<3/2$, which includes physically
important cases of dust $(\gamma=1)$ and radiation $(\gamma=4/3)$, are
asymptotically non-tilted; the velocity of the fluid with $\gamma=3/2$ tends to
a constant value $0<\bar{V}<1$; and stiffer fluids evolve towards a state of
extreme tilt. Finally, we show that diffusion significantly reduces the decay
rates of energy density for dust and fluids stiffer than dust $(\gamma \geq
1)$; for example, at $\gamma=4/3$ (radiation) we obtain $\rho/H^2 \propto
e^{-3H_0 t}$ at late times, while $\rho/H^2 \propto e^{-4H_0 t}$ when diffusion
is absent.

structural balance in signed social networks. Certain social networks contain,
in addition to the usual 'friend' links, 'enemy' links. These networks are
called signed social networks. A classical and major concept for signed social
networks is that of structural balance, i.e., the tendency of triangles to be
'balanced' towards including an even number of negative edges, such as
friend-friend-friend and friend-enemy-enemy triangles. In this article, we
introduce several new signed network analysis methods that exploit structural
balance for measuring partial balance, for finding communities of people based
on balance, for drawing signed social networks, and for solving the problem of
link prediction. Notably, the introduced methods are based on the signed graph
Laplacian and on the concept of signed resistance distances. We evaluate our
methods on a collection of four signed social network datasets.

we have proposed a gravitational tempering method based on a result of Monte
Carlo (MC) simulations using the HS model; after a colloidal crystal is grown
in a relatively strong gravitational field, the defects can be reduced by
decreasing the gravity strength and maintain for a period of time. Here, we
demonstrate this method using MC simulations with a programed gravitation. The
dramatic disappearance of defect structures is observed. Gravitational
tempering can complement gravitational annealing; some defect structures that
accidentally remain after gravitational annealing (keeping the colloidal
crystal under gravity of a considerable constant strength) can be erased.

establish a potentially interesting relationship between observed terminal
polydispersity in Lennard-Jones polydisperse spheres and prediction of the same
in the integral equation based theoretical analysis of liquid-solid transition.
As we increase polydispersity, solid becomes inherently unstable because of the
strain built up due to the size disparity. This aspect is studied here by
calculating the inherent structure (IS) calculation. With polydispersity at
constant volume fraction we find initially a sharp rise of the average IS
energy of the crystalline solid until transition polydispersity, followed by a
cross over to a weaker dependence of IS energy on polydispersity in the
amorphous state. This cross over from FCC to amorphous state predicted by IS
analysis agrees remarkably well with the solid-liquid phase diagram (with
extension into the metastable phase) generated by non-linear integral equation
theories of freezing. Two other well-known criteria of freezing/melting
transitions, the Hansen-Verlet rule of freezing and the Lindemann criterion of
melting are both shown to be remarkably in good agreement with the above two
estimates. Together they seem to indicate a small range of metastability in the
liquid-solid transition in polydisperse solids.

signals simultaneously transmitted by multiple users. In this paper, we assume
the transmitters do not have channel state information (CSI). The relay in the
PNC system, however, has CSI. The relay makes use of a belief propagation (BP)
algorithm to decode the multipath-distorted signals received from multiple
users into a network-coded packet. We refer to our multipath decoding algorithm
as MP-PNC. Our simulation results show that, benchmarked against synchronous
PNC over a one-path channel, the bit error rate (BER) performance penalty of
MP-PNC under a two-tap ITU channel model can be kept within 0.5dB. Moreover, it
outperforms a MUD-XOR algorithm by 3dB -- MUD-XOR decodes the individual
information from both users explicitly before performing the XOR network-coding
mapping. Although the framework of fading-channel PNC presented in this paper

three point QCD sum rules. First, we calculate the corresponding strong

calculate the corresponding decay widths and branching ratios. Making use of
the existing experimental data on the ratio of the decay width in the

  pages 235-286",,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Finding satisfying assignments for the variables involved in a set of
constraints can be cast as a (bounded) model generation problem: search for
(bounded) models of a theory in some logic. The state-of-the-art approach for
bounded model generation for rich knowledge representation languages, like ASP,
FO(.) and Zinc, is ground-and-solve: reduce the theory to a ground or
propositional one and apply a search algorithm to the resulting theory.
  An important bottleneck is the blowup of the size of the theory caused by the
reduction phase. Lazily grounding the theory during search is a way to overcome
this bottleneck. We present a theoretical framework and an implementation in
the context of the FO(.) knowledge representation language. Instead of
grounding all parts of a theory, justifications are derived for some parts of
it. Given a partial assignment for the grounded part of the theory and valid
justifications for the formulas of the non-grounded part, the justifications
provide a recipe to construct a complete assignment that satisfies the
non-grounded part. When a justification for a particular formula becomes
invalid during search, a new one is derived; if that fails, the formula is
split in a part to be grounded and a part that can be justified.
  The theoretical framework captures existing approaches for tackling the
grounding bottleneck such as lazy clause generation and grounding-on-the-fly,
and presents a generalization of the 2-watched literal scheme. We present an
algorithm for lazy model expansion and integrate it in a model generator for
FO(ID), a language extending first-order logic with inductive definitions. The
algorithm is implemented as part of the state-of-the-art FO(ID) Knowledge-Base
System IDP. Experimental results illustrate the power and generality of the
approach.

a wall at the top and bottom is considered. By bringing the mixture into its
miscibility gap so that no spinodal decomposition occurs in the bulk, a slight
energetic bias of the walls towards each one of the constituents ensures the
nucleation of thin boundary layers that grow until the constituents have moved
into one of the two layers. These layers are separated by an interfacial region
where the composition changes rapidly. Conditions that ensure the separation
into two layers with a thin interfacial region are investigated based on a
phase-field model. Using matched asymptotic expansions a corresponding
sharp-interface problem for the location of the interface is established.
  It is then argued that this newly created two-layer system is not at its
energetic minimum but destabilizes into a controlled self-replicating pattern
of trapezoidal vertical stripes by minimizing the interfacial energy between
the phases while conserving their area. A quantitative analysis of this
mechanism is carried out via a thin-film model for the free interfaces, which
is derived asymptotically from the sharp-interface model.

two clear younger cold fronts on opposite sides of the cluster. The scenario
appears qualitatively consistent with simulations of gas sloshing due to minor
mergers which raise cold, low entropy gas from the core to higher radius,
resulting in a swirling distribution of opposing cold fronts at increasing
radii. However the scale of the observed sloshing is much larger than that
which has been simulated at present, and is similar to the large scale sloshing

Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) Godunov-type finite volume method with

construction locally and globally conservative. The scheme is based on a
one-step predictor-corrector methodology in space-time and uses three main
building blocks: First, a high order piecewise polynomial WENO reconstruction,
to obtain a high order data representation in space from the known cell
averages of the underlying finite volume scheme. Second, a high order
space-time Galerkin predictor step based on a weak formulation of the governing
PDE on moving control volumes. Third, a high order one-step finite volume
scheme, based directly on the integral formulation of the conservation law in
space-time. The algorithm being entirely based on space-time control volumes
naturally allows for hanging nodes also in time, hence in this framework the
implementation of a consistent and conservative time-accurate LTS becomes very
natural and simple. The method is validated on some classical shock tube
problems for the Euler equations of compressible gasdynamics and the
magnetohydrodynamics equations (MHD). The performance of the new scheme is
compared with a classical high order ALE finite volume scheme based on global
time stepping. To the knowledge of the author, this is the first high order

3(H_I H)^2 /32 \pi^2 $ in the matter-dominated (MD) period, where $H_I$ and $H$
are the Hubble parameters during inflation and at each moment. Its equation of
state, $w=\rho/p$, changes from a negative value to $w=1/3$ in the
radiation-dominated period, and from $1/3$ to $w=0$ in the MD period. We then
consider possible effects of a Planckian universe, which may have existed
before inflation, by assuming there was another inflation with the Hubble
parameter $H_P (> H_I)$. In this case, modes with wavelengths longer than the
current horizon radius are mainly amplified, and the energy density of a
quantum field grows with time as $\rho \sim (a/a_0)(H_P H)^2/32$ in the MD
period, where $a$ and $a_0$ are the scale factors at each time and at present.
Hence, if $H_P$ is of the order of the Planck scale $M_P$, $\rho$ becomes
comparable to the critical density $3(M_P H)^2$ at the present time. The
contribution to $\rho$ from the long wavelength fluctuations generated before
the ordinary inflation has $w=-1/3$ in the free field approximation. We mention

instrument mounted on the Gemini South telescope, delivers a uniform, near
diffraction limited images at near infrared wavelengths (0.95 microns- 2.5
microns) over a field of view of 120 arc seconds. GeMS is the first sodium
layer based multi laser guide star adaptive optics system used in astronomy. It
uses five laser guide stars distributed on a 60 arc seconds square
constellation to measure for atmospheric distortions and two deformable mirrors
to compensate for it. In this paper, the second devoted to describe the GeMS
project, we present the commissioning, overall performance and operational
scheme of GeMS. Performance of each sub-system is derived from the
commissioning results. The typical image quality, expressed in full with half
maximum, Strehl ratios and variations over the field delivered by the system
are then described. A discussion of the main contributor to performance
limitation is carried-out. Finally, overheads and future system upgrades are
described.

n-dimensional Euclidean spaces with large deformations. Given a set of feature
correspondences, our algorithm searches for an optimal folding-free mapping
that satisfies the prescribed landmark constraints. The standard conformality
distortion defined for mappings between 2-dimensional spaces is first
generalized to the $n$-dimensional conformality distortion $K(f)$ for a mapping
$f$ between $n$-dimensional Euclidean spaces $(n \geq 3)$. We then propose a
variational model involving $K(f)$ to tackle the landmark-matching problem in
higher dimensional spaces. The generalized conformality term $K(f)$ enforces
the bijectivity of the optimized mapping and minimizes its local geometric
distortions even with large deformations. Another challenge is the high
computational cost of the proposed model. To tackle this, we have also proposed
a numerical method to solve the optimization problem more efficiently.
Alternating direction method with multiplier (ADMM) is applied to split the
optimization problem into two subproblems. Preconditioned conjugate gradient
method with multi-grid preconditioner is applied to solve one of the
sub-problems, while a fixed-point iteration is proposed to solve another
subproblem. Experiments have been carried out on both synthetic examples and
lung CT images to compute the diffeomorphic landmark-matching transformation
with different landmark constraints. Results show the efficacy of our proposed
model to obtain a folding-free landmark-matching transformation between
$n$-dimensional spaces with large deformations.

considerably. This work considers a Bayesian approach for selecting the number
of clusters and the best clustering variables. The main idea is to reformulate
the problem of group and variable selection as a probabilistically driven
search over a large discrete space using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods. This approach results in estimates of degree of relevance of each
variable for clustering along with posterior probability for the number of
clusters. Bayes factors can then be easily calculated, and a suitable model
chosen in a principled manner. Both selection tasks are carried out
simultaneously using an MCMC approach based on a collapsed Gibbs sampling
method, whereby several model parameters are integrated from the model,
substantially improving computational performance. Approaches for estimating
posterior marginal probabilities of class membership, variable inclusion and
number of groups are proposed, and post-hoc procedures for parameter and
uncertainty estimation are outlined. The approach is tested on simulated and
real data.

optomechanical system. Unlike standard sideband cooling, this scheme applies to
the so-called unresolved sideband regime, where the resonance frequency of the
mechanical mode is much smaller than the cavity linewidth. Ground state cooling
becomes possible when assuming the presence of an additional, auxiliary
mechanical mode and exploiting the effect of optomechanically induced
transparency. We first consider a system where one optical cavity interacts
with two mechanical modes, and show that ground state cooling of the unresolved
mechanical mode is possible when the auxiliary mode is in the resolved sideband
regime. We then present a modified setup involving two cavity modes, where both
mechanical modes are allowed to be in the unresolved sideband regime.

the one hand, long range magnetic order disappears as doping approaches 2% from

the other hand, cuprates become insulating at low temperature when the doping
approaches 2% from above, thus restricting angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES). In fact, ARPES data for samples with doping lower than 3%
are rare and missing the quasiparticle peaks in the energy distribution curves

the resistivity of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ as a function of temperature, at

both experiments. By preparing a series of LSCO single crystals with $\sim

It is shown
that using several topological tools a theory can be designed that implements
the quantization of a single Weyl doublet anomaly free while keeping the
non-abelian character of the particle in the theory. This opens the perspective
for non-Abelian statistics of deconfined particle like objects in 3+1
dimensions and for applications in Quantum Computing. Moreover, if this
loophole cannot be closed, old arguments related to anomaly cancelations must
be reviewed.

$\wedge^k_{\alpha,p,q}(\R)$ in the context of Dunkl harmonic analysis on $\R$,
for all real $\alpha$. It also introduces a generalized Dunkl-Lipschitz spaces
${\cal T}\wedge^k_{\alpha,p,q}(\R^2_+)$ of $k$-temperature on $\R^2_+$.
  Some properties and continuous embedding of these spaces and the isomorphism
of ${\cal T}\wedge^k_{\alpha,p,q}(\R^2_+)$ and $\wedge^k_{\alpha,p,q}(\R)$ are
established.

quantum theory, in this paper first it's studied the rise of the wave
properties of matter from the theory of stochastic electrodynamics (SED), in
which de Broglie's idea of a guiding wave that follows the particle and
determine its trajectory is taken back. In the frame of the theory (SED) this
wave is of electromagnetic character and is a traveling wave that propagates
within the zero point field (ZPF) which according the SED is a classic
electromagnetic field that permeates all universe. The wave rise from the
interaction between the background field and the particle that moves with
certain velocity. Then, I expose the results of numerical simulations in which
the behavior of the ZPF in a two slit diffraction experiment is calculated and
a series of macroscopic experiments that shows behaviors similar to the ones
described by the SED. Both, simulations and experiments give us a better
physical understanding of the guiding wave and of the wave properties of
quantum particles

approximation polynomials of the differentiable function $f$ on $[-1,1]$.
Especially, when $P_n$ is the best approximation of $f$, he estimates the
differences $\|f^{(k)}-P_n^{(k)}\|_{L_\infty([-1,1])}$, $k=0,1,2,...$. In this
paper, we give the analogies for them with respect to the differentiable
functions on $\mathbb{R}$, and we apply the result to the monotone
approximation.

Taloba","An Effective Evolutionary Clustering Algorithm: Hepatitis C Case Study",,,,,"cs.NE cs.CE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  Clustering analysis plays an important role in scientific research and
commercial application. K-means algorithm is a widely used partition method in
clustering. However, it is known that the K-means algorithm may get stuck at
suboptimal solutions, depending on the choice of the initial cluster centers.
In this article, we propose a technique to handle large scale data, which can
select initial clustering center purposefully using Genetic algorithms (GAs),
reduce the sensitivity to isolated point, avoid dissevering big cluster, and
overcome deflexion of data in some degree that caused by the disproportion in
data partitioning owing to adoption of multi-sampling. We applied our method to
some public datasets these show the advantages of the proposed approach for
example Hepatitis C dataset that has been taken from the machine learning
warehouse of University of California. Our aim is to evaluate hepatitis
dataset. In order to evaluate this dataset we did some preprocessing operation,
the reason to preprocessing is to summarize the data in the best and suitable
way for our algorithm. Missing values of the instances are adjusted using local
mean method.
