of templates between them (migration) are key elements of a modern scenario for
prebiotic evolution. Here we use the diffusion approximation of population
genetics to study analytically the steady-state properties of such prebiotic
scenario. The coexistence of distinct template types inside a protocell is
achieved by a selective pressure at the protocell level (group selection)
favoring protocells with a mixed template composition. In the degenerate case,
where the templates have the same replication rate, we find that a vanishingly
small migration rate suffices to eliminate the segregation effect of random
drift and so to promote coexistence. In the non-degenerate case, a small
migration rate greatly boosts coexistence as compared with the situation where
there is no migration. However, increase of the migration rate beyond a
critical value leads to the complete dominance of the more efficient template
type (homogeneous regime). In this case, we find a continuous phase transition
separating the homogeneous and the coexistence regimes, with the order
parameter vanishing linearly with the distance to the transition point.

coherent control over quantum systems with an ever increasing number of
particles. Within this endeavor, the harnessing of many-body entanglement
against the effects of the environment is a pressing issue. Besides being an
important concept from a fundamental standpoint, entanglement is recognized as
a crucial resource for performance enhancements over classical methods.
Understanding and controlling many-body entanglement in open systems may have
implications in quantum computing, quantum simulations, secure quantum
communication, quantum metrology, our understanding of the quantum-to-classical
transition, and other important questions of quantum foundations.
  Here we present an overview of recent theoretical and experimental efforts to
underpin the dynamics of entanglement in open quantum systems. Entanglement is
taken as a dynamic quantity, and we survey how it evolves due to the
interaction of the entangled system with its surroundings. We analyze several
scenarios, corresponding to different families of states and environments,
which render a diversity of dynamical behaviors.
  Contrary to single-particle quantities, that typically vanish only
asymptotically in time, entanglement may disappear at a finite time. Moreover,
important classes of entanglement show an exponential decay with the system
size when subject to local noise, posing yet another threat to the already
challenging scaling of quantum technologies. Results for the local and global
noise cases are summarized. Robustness-enhancement techniques, scaling laws,
statistical and geometrical aspects of multipartite-entanglement decay are also
reviewed; all in order to give a broad picture of entanglement dynamics in open
quantum systems addressed to both theorists and experimentalists inside and
outside the field of quantum information.

become detectable through consequent modifications in the energy dependence of
the electron's momentum and lifetime. Here we introduce a
theoretical/experimental approach aimed at identifying the relevant
fluctuations of iron-based superconductors by measuring effects of their
self-energy. We use quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging techniques in
LiFeAs to reveal strongly momentum-space anisotropic self-energy signatures
that are focused along the Fe-Fe (interband scattering) direction, where the
spin fluctuations of LiFeAs are concentrated. These effects coincide in energy
with perturbations to the density-of-states N(\omega) usually associated with
the Cooper pairing interaction. We show that all the measured phenomena
comprise the predicted QPI `fingerprint' of a self-energy due to
antiferromagnetic spin-fluctuations, thereby distinguishing them as the
predominant electron-boson interaction.

$6\times10^7$ M$_{\odot}$, with a median HI mass of $1\times10^7$ M$_{\odot}$.
The TRGB distances are up to 73% farther than flow-model estimates in the
ALFALFA catalog. Because of the relatively large uncertainties of flow model
distances, we are biased towards selecting galaxies from the ALFALFA catalog
where the flow model underestimates the true distances. The measured distances
allow for an assessment of the native environments around the sample members.
Five of the galaxies are part of the NGC 672 and NGC 784 groups, which together
constitute a single structure. One galaxy is part of a larger linear ensemble
of 9 systems that stretches 1.6 Mpc from end to end. Two galaxies reside in
regions with 1-4 neighbors, and four galaxies are truly isolated with no known
system identified within a radius of 1 Mpc.

being easily deployed in a practical setup. Motivated by current deployments of
LTE-Advanced, the use of multi-polarized antennas can be an efficient solution
to address the space constraint. Furthermore, the dual-structured precoding, in
which a preprocessing based on the spatial correlation and a subsequent linear
precoding based on the short-term channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT) are concatenated, can reduce the feedback overhead efficiently. By
grouping and preprocessing spatially correlated mobile stations (MSs), the
dimension of the precoding signal space is reduced and the corresponding
short-term CSIT dimension is reduced. In this paper, to reduce the feedback
overhead further, we propose a dual-structured multi-user linear precoding, in
which the subgrouping method based on co-polarization is additionally applied
to the spatially grouped MSs in the preprocessing stage. Furthermore, under
imperfect CSIT, the proposed scheme is asymptotically analyzed based on random
matrix theory. By investigating the behavior of the asymptotic performance, we
also propose a new dual-structured precoding in which the precoding mode is
switched between two dual-structured precoding strategies with 1) the
preprocessing based only on the spatial correlation and 2) the preprocessing
based on both the spatial correlation and polarization. Finally, we extend it
to 3D dual-structured precoding.

The most important weaknesses of the approach is that it gives rise to many
different consistent sets, and it has been argued that a complete
interpretation should be accompanied with a natural mechanism leading to a
(possibly) unique preferred consistent set. The existence of multiple
consistent sets becomes more problematic because it allows the existence of
contrary inferences (Kent 1997). We analyse the conceptual difficulties that
arise from the existence of multiple consistent sets and provide a suggestion
for a natural set selection criterion. This criterion does not lead to a unique
physical consistent set, however it evades the existence of consistent sets
with contrary inferences. The criterion is based on the concept of preclusion
and the requirement that probability one propositions and their inferences
should be noncontextual. The allowed consistent sets turn-out to be compatible
with coevents which are the ontology of an alternative, histories based,
formulation.

encode the (local) decision making among candidate goal assignments, under
which a group of connected agents chooses the assignment that results in the
shortest total distance to the goals. An additional family of Lyapunov-like
barrier functions is activated in the case when the optimal assignment may lead
to colliding trajectories, maintaining thus system safety while preserving the
convergence guarantees. The proposed switching strategies give rise to feedback
control policies that are computationally efficient and scalable with the
number of agents, and therefore suitable for applications including
first-response deployment of robotic networks under limited information
sharing. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated via simulation
results and experiments with six ground robots.

is ruling the evolution of the early universe, by providing the necessary dark
energy which remains the dominant energy density. SM running couplings not only
allow us to extrapolate SM physics up to the Planck scale, but equally
important they are triggering the Higgs mechanism. This is possible by the fact
that the bare mass term in the Higgs potential changes sign at about mu_0 =
1.4x10^16 GeV and in the symmetric phase is enhanced by quadratic terms in the
Planck mass. Such a huge Higgs mass term is able to play a key role in
triggering inflation in the early universe. In this article we extend our
previous investigation by working out the details of a Higgs inflation
scenario. We show how different terms contributing to the Higgs Lagrangian are
affecting inflation. Given the SM and its extrapolation to scales mu>mu_0 we
find a calculable cosmological constant V(0) which is weakly scale dependent
and actually remains large during inflation. This is different to the Higgs
fluctuation field dependent Delta V(phi), which decays exponentially during
inflation, and actually would not provide a sufficient amount of inflation. The
fluctuation field has a different effective mass which shifts the bare Higgs
transition point to a lower value mu'_0 = 7.7x10^14 GeV. The vacuum energy V(0)
being proportional to M_Pl^4 has a coefficient which vanishes near the Higgs
transition point, such that the bare and the renormalized cosmological constant
match at this point. The role of the Higgs in reheating and baryogenesis is
emphasized.

dynamical activity near current sheets. To gain insight into the complex
scenario of coronal charged particle acceleration, we investigate the
properties of acceleration with a test-particle approach using
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. These are obtained from
direct solutions of the reduced MHD equations, well suited for a plasma
embedded in a strong axial magnetic field, relevant to the inner heliosphere. A
multi-box, multi-scale technique is used to solve the equations of motion for

in the system, namely from the ion inertial scale of the order of a meter up to
macroscopic scales of the order of $10\,$km ($1/100$th of the outer scale of
the system). This new technique is useful to identify the mechanisms that,
acting at different scales, are responsible for acceleration to high energies
of a small fraction of the particles in the coronal plasma. We report results
that describe acceleration at different stages over a broad range of time,

correctly computes most of the bits of $A$, but which potentially does not halt
on all inputs. The motivation for this concept is derived from complexity
theory, where it has been noticed that frequently, it is more important to know
how difficult a type of problem is in the general case than how difficult it is
in the worst case. When we study this concept from a recursion theoretic point
of view, to create a transitive relationship, we are forced to consider oracles
that sometimes fail to give answers when asked questions. Unfortunately, this
makes working in the generic degrees quite difficult. Indeed, we show that
generic reduction is $\mathbf\Pi^1_1-$complete. To help avoid this difficulty,
we work with the generic degrees of density-1 reals. We demonstrate how an
understanding of these degrees leads to a greater understanding of the overall
structure of the generic degrees, and we also use these density-1 sets to
provide a new a characterization of the hyperartithmetical Turing degrees.

global solution is hard to attain, statisticians always use the better if there
are two solutions for chosen, where the word ""better"" is understood in the
sense of optimization. This seems reasonable in that the better solution is
more likely to be the global solution, whose statistical properties of interest
usually have been well established. From the statistical perspective, we use
the better solution because we intuitively believe the principle, called better
solution principle (BSP) in this paper, that a better solution to a statistical
optimization problem also has better statistical properties of interest. BSP
displays some concordance between optimization and statistics, and is expected
to widely hold. Since theoretical study on BSP seems to be neglected by
statisticians, this paper aims to establish a framework for discussing BSP in
various statistical optimization problems. We demonstrate several simple but
effective comparison theorems as the key results of this paper, and apply them
to verify BSP in commonly encountered statistical optimization problems,
including maximum likelihood estimation, best subsample selection, and best
subset regression. It can be seen that BSP for these problems holds under
reasonable conditions, i.e., a better solution indeed has better statistical
properties of interest. In addition, guided by the BSP theory, we develop a new
best subsample selection method that performs well when there are clustered
outliers.

spatially flat, matter-dominated universe. The first type is a `$\Lambda(t)$
type' similar to $\Lambda(t)$CDM (varying-lambda cold dark matter) models in
which both the Friedmann equation and the acceleration equation include an
extra driving term. The second type is a `BV type' similar to bulk viscous
models in which the acceleration equation includes an extra driving term
whereas the Friedmann equation does not. In order to examine the two types
systematically, we consider an extended entropic-force model that includes a
Hubble parameter ($H$) term and a constant term in entropic-force terms. The
$H$ term is derived from a volume entropy whereas the constant term is derived
from an entropy proportional to the square of an area entropy. Based on the
extended entropic-force model, we examine four models obtained from combining
the $H$ and constant terms with the $\Lambda(t)$ and BV types. The four models
agree well with the observed supernova data and describe the background
evolution of the late universe properly. However, the evolution of first-order
density perturbations is different in each of the four models, especially for
low redshift, assuming that an effective sound speed is negligible. The
$\Lambda(t)$ type is found to be consistent with the observed growth rate of
clustering, in contrast with the BV type examined in this study. A unified
formulation is proposed as well, in order to examine density perturbations of
the two types systematically.

to an integrated luminosity of 9.45 fb$^{-1}$ from Fermilab Tevatron
proton-antiproton collisions at a center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV, is used.
Assuming the electroweak production of top quarks of mass 172.5 GeV/$c^2$ in
the $s$-channel, a cross section of $1.12_{-0.57}^{+0.61}$ (stat+syst) pb, with
a significance of 1.9 standard deviations, is measured. This measurement is
combined with a previous result obtained from events with an imbalance in total
transverse momentum, $b$-tagged jets, and exactly one identified lepton,
yielding a cross section of $1.36_{-0.32}^{+0.37}$ (stat+syst) pb, with a
significance of 4.2 standard deviations.

  Mutual-Information Privacy",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates the relation between three different notions of
privacy: identifiability, differential privacy and mutual-information privacy.
Under a unified privacy-distortion framework, where the distortion is defined
to be the Hamming distance of the input and output databases, we establish some
fundamental connections between these three privacy notions. Given a distortion
level $D$, define $\epsilon_{\mathrm{i}}^*(D)$ to be the smallest (best)
identifiability level, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{d}}^*(D)$ to be the smallest
differential privacy level. We characterize $\epsilon_{\mathrm{i}}^*(D)$ and
$\epsilon_{\mathrm{d}}^*(D)$, and prove that
$\epsilon_{\mathrm{i}}^*(D)-\epsilon_X\le\epsilon_{\mathrm{d}}^*(D)\le\epsilon_{\mathrm{i}}^*(D)$
for $D$ in some range, where $\epsilon_X$ is a constant depending on the
distribution of the original database $X$, and diminishes to zero when the
distribution of $X$ is uniform. Furthermore, we show that identifiability and
mutual-information privacy are consistent in the sense that given distortion
level $D$, the mechanism that optimizes the mutual-information privacy also
minimizes the identifiability level.

to calculate the mean-square Euclidean displacements in the short-time regime.
Our findings show that from an extrinsic point of view the geometry of the
space affects the Brownian motion in such a way that the particle's diffusion
is decelerated, contrasting with the intrinsic point of view where dynamics is
controlled by the sign of the Gaussian curvature [J. Stat. Mech. P08006

$\left<\delta{\bf R}\right>$ and $\left<\delta{\bf R}^{2}\right>$ on spheres

case, surprisingly, Brownian motion corresponds to the usual diffusion in flat
geometries, albeit minimal surfaces have non-zero Gaussian curvature. Finally,
the two-dimensional case is emphasized due to its close relation to surface
self-diffusion in fluid membranes.

have been recently discovered in the data obtained with the Kepler spacecraft.
Though most of these stars are thought to have a rotation period shorter than
10 days on the basis of photometric variabilities, the two targets of the
present paper are estimated to have a rotation period of 21.8 d, and 25.3 d.
Our spectroscopic results clarified that these stars have stellar parameters
similar to those of the Sun in terms of the effective temperature, surface
gravity, and metallicity. The projected rotational velocities derived by us are
consistent with the photometric rotation period, indicating a fairy high
inclination angle. The average strength of the magnetic field on the surface of
these stars are estimated to be 1-20 G, by using the absorption line of Ca II

homomorphism from $G$ to $H$. We deal with regular covers in which this locally
bijective homomorphism is prescribed by an action of a subgroup of ${\rm
Aut}(G)$. Regular covers have many applications in constructions and studies of
big objects all over mathematics and computer science.
  We study computational aspects of regular covers that have not been addressed
before. The decision problem RegularCover asks for two given graphs $G$ and $H$
whether $G$ regularly covers $H$. When $|H|=1$, this problem becomes Cayley
graph recognition for which the complexity is still unresolved. Another special
case arises for $|G| = |H|$ when it becomes the graph isomorphism problem.
Therefore, we restrict ourselves to graph classes with polynomially solvable
graph isomorphism.
  Inspired by Negami, we apply the structural results used by Babai in the
1970's to study automorphism groups of graphs. Our main result is the following
FPT meta-algorithm: Let $\cal C$ be a class of graphs such that the structure
of automorphism groups of 3-connected graphs in $\cal C$ is simple. Then we can
solve RegularCover for $\cal C$-inputs $G$ in time $O^*(2^{e(H)/2})$ where
$e(H)$ denotes the number of the edges of $H$. As one example of $\cal C$, this
meta-algorithm applies to planar graphs. In comparison, testing general graph
covers is known to be NP-complete for planar inputs $G$ even for small fixed
graphs $H$ such as $K_4$ or $K_5$. Most of our results also apply to general
graphs, in particular the complete structural understanding of regular covers

determined exclusively within the folding model by the difference between the

information of high value to human or electronic observers. However, not all
the information contained in a pair of continuous trajectories is important and
thus the need for qualitative descriptions of interaction trajectories arises.
The Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC) (Van de Weghe, 2004) is a promising
development towards this goal. Numerous variants of QTC have been proposed in
the past and QTC has been applied towards analyzing various interaction
domains. However, an inherent limitation of those QTC variations that deal with
lateral movements is that they are limited to two-dimensional motion;
therefore, complex three-dimensional interactions, such as those occurring
between flying planes or birds, cannot be captured. Towards that purpose, in
this paper QTC3Dis presented: a novel qualitative trajectory calculus that can
deal with full three-dimensional interactions. QTC3D is based on
transformations of the Frenet-Serret frames accompanying the trajectories of
the moving objects. Apart from the theoretical exposition, including definition
and properties, as well as computational aspects, we also present an
application of QTC3D towards modeling bird flight. Thus, the power of QTC is
now extended to the full dimensionality of physical space, enabling succinct
yet rich representations of spatial interactions between agents.

enhanced by map-awareness, i.e., by the knowledge of the map of the environment
in which localization signals are acquired. In fact, this knowledge can be
exploited to cancel out, at least to some extent, the signal degradation due to
propagation through physical obstructions, i.e., to the so called
non-line-of-sight bias. This result can be achieved by developing novel
localization techniques that rely on proper map-aware statistical modelling of
the measurements they process. In this manuscript a unified statistical model
for the measurements acquired in map-aware localization systems based on
time-of-arrival and received signal strength techniques is developed and its
experimental validation is illustrated. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed
map-aware model is assessed and compared with that offered by its map-unaware

of the Generalized Extreme Value distribution. Our technique is suitable for

spectroscopic techniques, and complementing this with density functional theory
calculations, we find that Fe-doping in bulk ZnO induces isovalent (and
isostructural) cation substitution (Fe2+ -> Zn2+). In contrast to this,
Fe-doping near the surface produces both isovalent and heterovalent
substitution (Fe3+ -> Zn2+). The calculations performed herein suggest that the
most likely defect structure is the single or double substitution of Zn with
Fe, although, if additional oxygen is available, then Fe substitution with
interstitial oxygen is even more energetically favourable. Furthermore, it is
found that ferromagnetic states are energetically unfavourable, and
ferromagnetic ordering is likely to be realized only through the formation of a
secondary phase (i.e. ZnFe2O4), or codoping with Cu.

radial adiabatic pulsations of polytropes. These series include a
time-dependent function, unknown yet. If a polytrope is uniform this function
is obtainable; it is governed by the well-known equation of Bhatnagar and
Kothari. In the present work it is shown that the pulsations of a polytrope
with a near-equilibrium stratification are described by the same equation.
These pulsations are nonlinear and their periods do not equal to the periods of
the standard model. The periods of the vanishingly small pulsations are
obtained; using them, the period-mass-radius relation is deduced. This relation
is used to estimate masses of 11 chosen Cepheids with firmly known radii; all
the masses found are between 5 and 11 solar masses that correlate well with the
results of the stellar evolution theory.

complexity of different types of dropout, and our theoretical results disclose
that for shallow neural networks (with one or none hidden layer) dropout is
able to reduce the Rademacher complexity in polynomial, whereas for deep neural
networks it can amazingly lead to an exponential reduction of the Rademacher
complexity.
