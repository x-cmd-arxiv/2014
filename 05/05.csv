spin-orbit-coupled Fermi gases in the presence of Zeeman field. By solving the
Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations, we obtain the phase diagram at given chemical
potential and order parameter. We show that the system undergoes a phase
transition from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superfluid to topological superfluid
as increasing the intensity of Zeeman field. By comparing to the two-component
system, we find, besides the topological phase transition from the trivial
superfluid to nontrivial topological superfluid, the system can always be in a
nontrivial topological superfluid, and there are two Majorana zero energy
regions while increasing the magnetic field. We find the three-component
spin-orbit-coupled Fermi gases in certain parameter range is more optimizing
for experimental realization due to the smaller magnetic field needed. We
therefore propose a promising candidate for realizing topological superfluid.

We find that the CMB spectrum is only affected at very low multipoles. Cosmic
variance allows for significant warm dark matter at late times. This implies
that in MaVaNs cosmology $\sigma_8$ as determined by the CMB may not be a good
determinant of structure evolution at late times, potentially reducing the
tension between $\sigma$$_{8}$ as reported by Planck Collaboration

galaxy (NLSy1), 1H 0323+342, detected by Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope.
Multi-band light curves show many orphan X-ray and optical flares having no
corresponding {\gamma}-ray counterparts. Such anomalous variability behavior
can be due to different locations of the emission region from the central
source. During a large flare, {\gamma}-ray flux doubling time scale as small as
$\sim$ 3 hours is noticed. We built spectral energy distribution (SED) during
different activity states and modeled them using an one-zone leptonic model.
The shape of the optical/UV component of the SEDs is dominated by accretion
disk emission in all the activity states. In the X-ray band, significant
thermal emission from the hot corona is inferred during quiescent and first
flaring states, however, during subsequent flares, non-thermal jet component
dominates. The {\gamma}-ray emission in all the states can be well explained by
inverse-Compton scattering of accretion disk photons reprocessed by the broad
line region. The source showed violent intra-night optical variability,
coinciding with one of the high {\gamma}-ray activity states. An analysis of
the overall X-ray spectrum fitted with an absorbed power-law plus relativistic
reflection component hints for the presence of Fe K-{\alpha} line and returns a
high black hole spin value of a=0.96 $\pm$ 0.14. We argue that 1H 0323+342
possesses dual characteristics, akin to flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) as
well as radio-quiet NLSy1s, though at a low jet power regime compared to
powerful FSRQs.

scales, whereas the KSW frequency remains sub-cyclotron. At $\beta \sim 1$, the
plasma and magnetic pressure perturbations of both modes are in anti-phase, so
that there is nearly no total pressure perturbations. However, these modes
exhibit also several opposite properties. At high $% \beta $, the electric
polarization ratios of KAWs and KSWs are opposite at the ion gyroradius scale,

two-way relay channels, where there are $K$ source nodes, each equipped with
$M$ antennas, one relay node, equipped with $N$ antennas, and each source node
exchanges independent messages with an arbitrary set of other source nodes via
the relay. By allowing an arbitrary information exchange pattern, the
considered channel model is a unified one. It includes several existing channel
models as special cases: $K$-user MIMO Y channel, multi-pair MIMO two-way relay
channel, generalized MIMO two-way X relay channel, and $L$-cluster MIMO
multiway relay channel. Previous studies mainly considered the achievability of
the DoF cut-set bound $2N$ at the antenna configuration $N < 2M$ by applying
signal alignment. This work aims to investigate the achievability of the DoF
cut-set bound $KM$ for the case $N\geq 2M$. To this end, we first derive
tighter DoF upper bounds for three special cases of the considered channel
model. Then, we propose a new transmission framework, generalized signal
alignment, to approach these bounds. The notion of GSA is to form network-coded
symbols by aligning every pair of signals to be exchanged in a compressed
subspace at the relay. A necessary and sufficient condition to construct the
relay compression matrix is given. We show that using GSA, the new DoF upper
bound is achievable when i) $\frac{N}{M} \in \big(0, 2+\frac{4}{K(K-1)}\big]
\cup \big[K-2, +\infty\big)$ for the $K$-user MIMO Y channel; ii) $\frac{N}{M}

MIMO two-way relay channel; iii) $\frac{N}{M} \in \big(0, 2+\frac{8}{K^2}\big]
\cup \big[K-2, +\infty\big)$ for the generalized MIMO two-way X relay channel.
We also provide the antenna configuration regions for the general multi-user
MIMO two-way relay channel to achieve the total DoF $KM$.

that numbers of particles with different spin direction do not conserve. Hence
the continuity equations contain sources of particles. These sources are caused
by the interactions of spins with magnetic field. Terms of similar nature arise
in the Euler equation. We have that z-projection of the spin density is no
longer an independent variable. It is proportional to difference between
concentrations of electrons with spin-up and electrons with spin-down. In terms

reminiscent of impedance matching in circuit theory. It is well known that the
maximum power transfer in a circuit is achieved not for the maximum or minimum
load impedance but for the load impedance that matches the source impedance.
Similarly, the maximum DoF in the rank- constrained 2 X 2 X 2 MIMO interference
network is achieved not for the maximum or minimum ranks of the destination
hop, but when the ranks of the destination hop match the ranks of the source
hop. In fact, for mismatched settings of interest, the outer bounds identify a
DoF loss penalty that is precisely equal to the rank-mismatch between the two
hops. For symmetric settings, we also provide achievability results to show

best possible, i.e., they hold for all channels that satisfy the

variables such as commodity prices, population dynamics or even institutions,
are not exogenously specified but instead are seen as the results of
interactions. It is highlighted in the chapter that the understanding of

  The chapter reviews different approaches for modeling agents' behavior,
taking into account either explicit spatial (lattice based) structures or
networks. Some emphasis is placed on recent ABM as applied to the description
of the dynamics of the geographical distribution of economic activities, - out
of equilibrium. The Eurace@Unibi Model, an agent-based macroeconomic model with

accuracy at SBP-SAT grid interfaces is lower compared to that of the interior
stencils, we strive at using the interior stencils across block-boundaries
whenever possible. We devise a stable treatment of SBP-FD junction points, i.e.
points where interfaces with different boundary treatment meet. This leads to
stable discretizations for more flexible grid configurations within the SBP-SAT
framework, with a reduced number of SBP-SAT interfaces. Both first and second
derivatives are considered in the analysis. Even though the stencil order is
locally reduced close to numerical interfaces and corner points, numerical
simulations show that the locally reduced accuracy does not severely reduce the
accuracy of the time propagated numerical solution. Moreover, we explain how to
organize the grid and how to automatically adapt the mesh, aiming at problems
of many variables. Examples of adaptive grids are demonstrated for the

Graph Pricing is at most 1/2 + $\epsilon$.

has a domain size $T + 1$ for every $T \geq 1$. Generalized Max-Dicut(1) is

Generalized Max-Dicut on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to Graph Pricing, and
both our results are achieved through this reduction. Besides its connection to
Graph Pricing, the hardness of Generalized Max-Dicut is interesting in its own

algorithms perform better than LP-based or combinatorial algorithms --- for
this arity two CSP, a simple combinatorial algorithm does the best.

condition for stability, asymptotic stability, or global asymptotic stability
of an equilibrium point of an autonomous system $\dot{\mathbf{x}} =
f(\mathbf{x})$. In variants of Lyapunov theorems, the condition for a Lyapunov
candidate $V$ (continuously differentiable and positive definite function) to
be a Lyapunov function is that its time derivative along system trajectories
must be negative semi-definite or negative definite. Numerically checking
positive definiteness of $V$ is very difficult; checking negative definiteness
of $\dot{V}(\cdot)=\langle \nabla V(\cdot), f(\cdot) \rangle$ is even more
difficult, because it involves dynamics of the system.
  We give a necessary condition independent of the system dynamics, for every
Lyapunov function corresponding to the globally asymptotically stable
equilibrium point of $\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f(\mathbf{x})$. This necessary
condition is numerically easier to check than checking positive definiteness of
a function. Therefore, it can be used as a first level test to check whether a
given continuously differentiable function is a Lyapunov function candidate or
not. We also propose a method, which we call a generalized steepest descent
method, to check this condition numerically. Generalized steepest descent
method can be used for ruling out Lyapunov candidates corresponding to the
globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point of $\dot{\mathbf{x}} =

definiteness of a function, which is a necessary condition for a Lyapunov

M. Tulczyjew discovered an approach which brings the two
formalisms under a common geometric roof: the dynamics of a particle with
configuration space $X$ is determined by a Lagrangian submanifold $D$ of
$TT^*X$ (the total tangent space of $T^*X$), and the description of $D$ by its
Hamiltonian $H$: $T^*X\to \mathbb R$ (resp. its Lagrangian $L$: $TX\to\mathbb
R$) yields the Hamilton (resp. Euler-Lagrange) equation.
  It is reported here that Tulczyjew's approach also works for the dynamics of
(charged) particles in gauge fields, in which the role of the total cotangent
space $T^*X$ is played by Sternberg phase spaces. In particular, it is shown
that, for a particle in a gauge field, the equation of motion can be locally

to web applications have made the process of crawling a very challenging one.

addressed different issues and challenges that web crawlers face. Different

Performing an exhaustive crawl is a challenging question. Additionally
capturing the model of a modern web application and extracting data from it

three classes are pure cooperators, pure defectors, and fence-sitters. Here,
fence-sitters are the individuals who change their strategies at least once in

number of rounds that the individuals' payoffs are aggregated. We observe that
the payoff memory can control the fence-sitters' effects and the level of
cooperation efficiently. Our results indicate that the fence-sitters' role is
nontrivial in the complex topologies, which protects cooperation in an indirect

systems preserve fossil record of the early stages of galaxy formation. The
observed distribution of GC colors within massive early-type galaxies in the
ACS Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS) reveals a multi-modal shape, which likely
corresponds to a multi-modal metallicity distribution. We present a simple
model for the formation and disruption of GCs that aims to match the ACSVCS
data. This model tests the hypothesis that GCs are formed during major mergers
of gas-rich galaxies and inherit the metallicity of their hosts. To trace
merger events, we use halo merger trees extracted from a large cosmological
N-body simulation. We select 20 halos in the mass range of $2\times 10^{12}$ to
$7\times 10^{13}M_\odot$ and match them to 19 Virgo galaxies with K-band
luminosity between $3\times 10^{10}$ and $3\times 10^{11}L_\odot$. To set the
[Fe/H] abundances, we use an empirical galaxy mass-metallicity relation. We
find that a minimal merger ratio of 1:3 best matches the observed cluster
metallicity distribution. A characteristic bimodal shape appears because
metal-rich GCs are produced by late mergers between massive halos, while
metal-poor GCs are produced by collective merger activities of less massive
hosts at early times. The model outcome is robust to alternative prescriptions
for cluster formation rate throughout cosmic time, but a gradual evolution of
the mass-metallicity relation with redshift appears to be necessary to match
the observed cluster metallicities. We also affirm the age-metallicity
relation, predicted by an earlier model, in which metal-rich clusters are
systematically several billion years younger than their metal-poor
counterparts.

spatial resonance which reduces the reciprocal space dynamics to an effective
one-dimensional two-leg ladder case, the ac perturbation resonantly couples
certain groups of localized eigenstates of the undriven AA model and turns them

dynamics can be used to break the degeneracy between $f(R)$ gravity theories by
investigating the future dynamics of spatially homogeneous and isotropic dust
flat models in two $f(R)$ gravity theories, namely the well known $f(R) = R +
\alpha R^{n}$ gravity and another by A. Aviles et al., whose motivation comes
from the cosmographic approach to $f(R)$ gravity. To this end we perform a
detailed numerical study of the future dynamic of these flat model in these
theories taking into account the recent constraints on the cosmological
parameters made by the Planck team. We show that besides being powerful for
discriminating between $f(R)$ gravity theories, the future dynamics technique
can also be used to determine the fate of the Universe in the framework of
these $f(R)$ gravity theories. Moreover, there emerges from our numerical
analysis that if we do not invoke a dark energy component with
equation-of-state parameter $\omega < -1$ one still has dust flat FLRW solution
with a big rip, if gravity deviates from general relativity via $f(R) = R +

the most likely defect-prone software components, especially for new or

prediction performance of different defect predictors built with five
well-known classifiers using training data simplified at different levels of
granularity and with two popular filters. The results indicate that when using
the multi-granularity simplification method with an appropriate filter, the
prediction models based on Naive Bayes can achieve fairly good performance and
outperform the benchmark method.

$s_{a}$-potential parameters $\lambda_{a}=s_{a}\Lambda$ induced by a finite

makes sense in the framework of field theory. It may be compared to the
dimensional regularization of the perturbative field theory, in which the
running momentum scale is a pure scale of reference and not a momentum cutoff.
It is built from the Wilson historic first exact RG equation in which the
field-renormalization step is realized via an operator which is redundant and
exactly marginal at a fixed point, the properties of which are conserved by the
Legendre transformation and which modifies the usual removal of the overall UV
cutoff $\Lambda_{0}$ by associating it with the removal of an overall IR cutoff
$\mu $. Because the final equations do not refer to any true cutoff (even for
the scale-dependent $\Gamma $), it reinforces the idea that one may get rid of
the achronistic procedure of ""regularizing"" the theory via an explicit ""cutoff
function"", procedure which is often seen as an inconvenience to treat modern
problems in field theory.

higher temperatures at a rate of $\rm 45 \pm 7\,K\, yr^{-1}$. The heating rate
is consistent with a final mass of $\rm 0.626 ^{+0.003}_{-0.005} \, M_{\odot}$

2-260 revealed variations on a timescale of hours or days. The variability may
be caused by pulsations of the star. The temperature evolution of the central
star can be traced using spectroscopic observations of the surrounding
planetary nebula spanning a timescale of roughly a decade. This allows us to
precisely determine the stellar mass, since the pace of the temperature
evolution depends critically on the core mass. The kinematical age of the
nebula is consistent with the age obtained from the evolutionary track. The
final mass of the central star is close to the mass distribution peak for
central stars of planetary nebulae found in other studies. The object belongs
to a group of young central stars of planetary nebulae showing photometric
variability.

cross-sectional analysis, with the given temporal registration, and
consequently may lose the mean structure and artificially inflate observed
variances. We introduce a quantity that provides both a cost function for
temporal registration and a proper distance for comparison of trajectories.
This distance is used to define statistical summaries, such as sample means and
covariances, of synchronized trajectories and ""Gaussian-type"" models to capture
their variability at discrete times. It is invariant to identical time-warpings
(or temporal reparameterizations) of trajectories. This is based on a novel
mathematical representation of trajectories, termed transported square-root
vector field (TSRVF), and the $\mathbb{L}^2$ norm on the space of TSRVFs. We
illustrate this framework using three representative
manifolds---$\mathbb{S}^2$, $\mathrm {SE}(2)$ and shape space of planar
contours---involving both simulated and real data. In particular, we
demonstrate: (1) improvements in mean structures and significant reductions in
cross-sectional variances using real data sets, (2) statistical modeling for
capturing variability in aligned trajectories, and (3) evaluating random
trajectories under these models. Experimental results concern bird migration,

Finance, economics, hydrology and many other disciplines. In univariate extreme
value theory, we model the data by a suitable distribution from the general
max-domain of attraction (MAD) characterized by its tail index; there are three
broad classes of tails -- the Pareto type, the Weibull type and the Gumbel
type. The simplest and most common estimator of the tail index is the Hill
estimator that works only for Pareto type tails and has a high bias; it is also
highly non-robust in presence of outliers with respect to the assumed model.
There have been some recent attempts to produce asymptotically unbiased or
robust alternative to the Hill estimator; however all the robust alternatives
work for any one type of tail. This paper proposes a new general estimator of
the tail index that is both robust and has smaller bias under all the three
tail types compared to the existing robust estimators. This essentially
produces a robust generalization of the estimator proposed by Matthys and
Beirlant (2003) under the same model approximation through a suitable
exponential regression framework using the density power divergence. The
robustness properties of the estimator are derived in the paper along with an
extensive simulation study. A method for bias correction is also proposed with

this hysteresis using asymmetric forcing conditions --- rotating the impellers
at different speeds. For very high Reynolds numbers, we study the sensitivity
of the hysteresis cycle --- using complementary Particle Image Velocimetry
(PIV) and global mechanical measurements --- to the forcing nature, imposing
either the torque or the speed of the impellers. New mean states, displaying
multiple quasi-steady states and negative differential responses, are
experimentally observed in torque control. A simple analogy with electrical
circuits is performed to understand the link between multi-stability and
negative responses. The system is compared to other, similar ""bulk"" systems, to
understand some relevant ingredients of negative differential responses, and
studied in the framework of thermodynamics of long-range interacting systems.
The experimental results are eventually compared to the related problem of

branching, mutation and competition. Each individual is characterized by its
trait and the traits of its ancestors. Birth- and death-events happen at

The present model is an extension of the model used in [M\'el\'eard and Tran,

under additional assumptions, the diffusive limit is shown to converge to a
nonlinear historical superprocess. The main goal of the present article is to
verify a compact containment condition in the more general setup of Polish
trait-spaces and general mutation kernels that allow for a dependence on the
parent's trait. As a by-product, a result on the paths of individuals is
obtained. An application to evolving genealogies on marked metric measure
spaces is mentioned where genealogical distance, counted in terms of the number
of births without mutation, can be regarded as a trait. Because of the use of
exponential times in the modeling of birth- and death-events the analysis of
the modulus of continuity of the trait-history of a particle plays a major role
in obtaining appropriate bounds.

a similar behavior: a nearly constant non-zero emission at long baselines,
which suggests the presence of an unresolved component and an increase of the
fluxes at short baselines, related to the presence of an extended envelope. Our
data analysis leads to unusually low values of the spectral index $\alpha_{\rm
1.1-3mm}$, which may indicate that mm-sized dust grains have already formed
both in the envelopes and in the disk-like structures at such early stages. To
explore the possible scenarios for the interpretation of the sources we perform
a radiative transfer modeling using a Monte Carlo code, in order to take into
account possible deviations from the Rayleigh-Jeans and optically thin regimes.
Comparison between the model outputs and the observations indicates that dust
grains may form aggregates up to millimeter size already in the inner regions
of the envelopes of Class I YSOs. Moreover, we conclude that the embedded
disk-like structures in our two Class Is are probably very compact, in
particular in the case of WL12, with outer radii down to tens of AU.

due to the dynamic light scattering by irregular director fluctuations of the

chemistry of cold dense interstellar clouds with a full gas-grain reaction
network. The chemistry is treated by a unified microscopic-macroscopic Monte
Carlo approach that includes photon penetration and bulk diffusion. To
determine the significance of these two processes, we simulate the chemistry
with three different models. In Model 1, we use an exponential treatment to
follow how photons penetrate and photodissociate ice species throughout the
grain mantle. Moreover, the products of photodissociation are allowed to
diffuse via bulk diffusion and react within the ice mantle. Model 2 is similar
to Model 1 but with a slower bulk diffusion rate. A reference Model 0, which
only allows photodissociation reactions to occur on the top two layers, is also
simulated. Photodesorption is assumed to occur from the top two layers in all
three models. We found that the abundances of major stable species in grain
mantles do not differ much among these three models, and the results of our
simulation for the abundances of these species agree well with observations.
Likewise, the abundances of gas-phase species in the three models do not vary.
However, the abundances of radicals in grain mantles can differ by up to two
orders of magnitude depending upon the degree of photon penetration and the
bulk diffusion of photodissociation products. We also found that complex
molecules can be formed at temperatures as low as 10 K in all three models.

ambipolar, unlike tokamaks, in which the flux-surface averaged radial electric
current vanishes for any value of the radial electric field. Only
quasisymmetric stellarators are intrinsically ambipolar, but exact
quasisymmetry is impossible to achieve in non-axisymmetric toroidal
configurations. By calculating the violation of intrinsic ambipolarity due to
deviations from quasisymmetry, one can derive criteria to assess when a
stellarator can be considered quasisymmetric in practice, i.e. when the flow
damping is weak enough. Let us denote by $\alpha$ a small parameter that
controls the size of a perturbation to an exactly quasisymmetric magnetic
field. Recently, it has been shown that if the gradient of the perturbation is
sufficiently small, the flux-surface averaged radial electric current scales as
$\alpha^2$ for any value of the collisionality. It was also argued that when
the gradient of the perturbation is large, the quadratic scaling is replaced by
a more unfavorable one. In this paper, perturbations with large gradients are
rigorously treated. In particular, it is proven that for low collisionality a
perturbation with large gradient yields, at best, an $O(|\alpha|)$ deviation
from quasisymmetry. Heuristic estimations in the literature incorrectly
predicted an $O(|\alpha|^{3/2})$ deviation.

Assuming LTE, we perform a $\chi^2$ minimization of the high spectral
resolution HIFI observations of the CH transitions at ~532 and ~536 GHz in
order to derive column densities in the envelope and in the foreground cloud.
We obtain column densities of (7.7$\pm$0.2)$\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ and

provide a trigger signal, veto information against cosmic rays, and absolute
event timing. In this work, we discuss additional opportunities offered by
detectors with enhanced sensitivity to scintillation light, that is with light
collection efficiencies of about $10^{-3}$. We focus on two key detector
performance indicators for neutrino oscillation physics: calorimetric neutrino
energy reconstruction and neutrino/antineutrino separation in a non-magnetized
detector. Our results are based on detailed simulations, with neutrino
interactions modelled according to the GENIE event generator, while the charge
and light responses of a large LAr ideal detector are described by the Geant4
and NEST simulation tools. A neutrino energy resolution as good as 3.3\% RMS
for 4 GeV electron neutrino charged-current interactions can in principle be
obtained in a large detector of this type, by using both charge and light
information. By exploiting muon capture in argon and scintillation light
information to veto muon decay electrons, we also obtain muon neutrino
identification efficiencies of about 50\%, and muon antineutrino
misidentification rates at the few percent level, for few-GeV neutrino
interactions that are fully contained. We argue that the construction of large
LAr detectors with sufficiently high light collection efficiencies is in

perturbation experiments often only provide indirect information of network
structure. Here we propose hidden Markov nested effects models (HM-NEMs) to
model the evolving network by a Markov chain on a state space of signalling
networks, which are derived from nested effects models (NEMs) of indirect

a Gibbs sampler is developed, in which sampling network structure is
facilitated by a novel structural Metropolis--Hastings algorithm. We
demonstrate the potential of HM-NEMs by simulations on synthetic time-series

biological case studies, in one capturing dynamic crosstalk during the
progression of neutrophil polarisation, and in the other inferring an evolving
network underlying early differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.

  Results",,,,,"math.DS math-ph math.MP nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a general mechanism to establish the existence of diffusing orbits
in a large class of nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems. Our approach relies
on successive applications of the `outer dynamics' along homoclinic orbits to a
normally hyperbolic invariant manifold. The information on the outer dynamics
is encoded by a geometrically defined map, referred to as the `scattering map'.
  We find pseudo-orbits of the scattering map that keep advancing in some
privileged direction. Then we use the recurrence property of the `inner
dynamics', restricted to the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold, to return
to those pseudo-orbits. Finally, we apply topological methods to show the
existence of true orbits that follow the successive applications of the two
dynamics.
  This method differs, in several crucial aspects, from earlier works. Unlike
the well known `two-dynamics' approach, the method we present relies on the
outer dynamics alone. There are virtually no assumptions on the inner dynamics,
as its invariant objects (e.g., primary and secondary tori, lower dimensional
hyperbolic tori and their stable/unstable manifolds, Aubry-Mather sets) are not
used at all.
  The method applies to unperturbed Hamiltonians of arbitrary degrees of
freedom that are not necessarily convex. In addition, this mechanism is easy to
verify (analytically or numerically) in concrete examples, as well as to
establish diffusion in generic systems.
  We include several applications, such as bridging large gaps in a priori
unstable models in any dimension, and establishing diffusion in cases when the
inner dynamics is a non-twist map.

issue in knowledge discovering field. As the data distributions are obscure and
uncertain in high dimensional space, most existing solutions try to solve the
issue taking into account the two intuitive points: first, outliers are
extremely far away from other points in high dimensional space; second,
outliers are detected obviously different in projected-dimensional subspaces.
However, for a complicated case that outliers are hidden inside the normal
points in all dimensions, existing detection methods fail to find such inner
outliers. In this paper, we propose a method with twice dimension-projections,
which integrates primary subspace outlier detection and secondary
point-projection between subspaces, and sums up the multiple weight values for
each point. The points are computed with local density ratio separately in
twice-projected dimensions. After the process, outliers are those points
scoring the largest values of weight. The proposed method succeeds to find all
inner outliers on the synthetic test datasets with the dimension varying from
100 to 10000. The experimental results also show that the proposed algorithm
can work in low dimensional space and can achieve perfect performance in high

is regarded as a feasible approach in very high dimensional space. However, the
outliers found in subspaces are only part of the true outliers in high

sometimes neglected in the projected dimensional subspace. In this paper, we
propose a robust subspace method for detecting such inner outliers in a given
dataset, which uses two dimensional-projections: detecting outliers in
subspaces with local density ratio in the first projected dimensions; finding
outliers by comparing neighbor's positions in the second projected dimensions.
Each point's weight is calculated by summing up all related values got in the
two steps projected dimensions, and then the points scoring the largest weight
values are taken as outliers. By taking a series of experiments with the number
of dimensions from 10 to 10000, the results show that our proposed method
achieves high precision in the case of extremely high dimensional space, and
works well in low dimensional space.

353 GHz, which is the most sensitive Planck channel for dust polarization. We
construct and analyse large-scale maps of dust polarization fraction and
polarization direction, while taking account of noise bias and possible
systematic effects. We find that the maximum observed dust polarization
fraction is high (pmax > 18%), in particular in some of the intermediate dust
column density (AV < 1mag) regions. There is a systematic decrease in the dust
polarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret the
features of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignment
predictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. We also
characterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angle
dispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes,
the polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated by
filamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field sky
projection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust column
density. The polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with the
dispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likely
due to fluctuations in the 3D magnetic field orientation along the line of
sight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.We also compare the dust
emission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the Planck LFI,
with low-frequency radio data, and with Faraday rotation measurements of
extragalactic sources. The two polarized components are globally similar in
structure along the plane and notably in the Fan and North Polar Spur regions.
A detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust and
cosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirms
that much of the variation observed in the Planck data is due to the 3D
structure of the magnetic field.

nearby fields is presented, focusing on the statistics of polarization
fractions $p$ and angles $\psi$. The polarization fractions and column
densities in these nearby fields are representative of the range of values
obtained over the whole sky. We find that: (i) the largest polarization
fractions are reached in the most diffuse fields; (ii) the maximum polarization
fraction $p_\mathrm{max}$ decreases with column density $N_\mathrm{H}$ in the
more opaque fields with $N_\mathrm{H} > 10^{21}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$; and (iii)
the polarization fraction along a given line of sight is correlated with the
local spatial coherence of the polarization angle. These observations are
compared to polarized emission maps computed in simulations of anisotropic
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence in which we assume a uniform intrinsic
polarization fraction of the dust grains. We find that an estimate of this
parameter may be recovered from the maximum polarization fraction
$p_\mathrm{max}$ in diffuse regions where the magnetic field is ordered on
large scales and perpendicular to the line of sight. This emphasizes the impact
of anisotropies of the magnetic field on the emerging polarization signal. The
decrease of the polarization fraction with column density in nearby molecular
clouds is well reproduced in the simulations, indicating that it is essentially
due to the turbulent structure of the magnetic field: an accumulation of
variously polarized structures along the line of sight leads to such an
anti-correlation. In the simulations, polarization fractions are also found to
anti-correlate with the angle dispersion function $\mathcal{S}$. [abridged]

submillimetre polarized emission from Galactic dust, bringing new constraints
on the properties of dust. The dust grains that emit the radiation seen by
Planck in the submillimetre also extinguish and polarize starlight in the
visible. Comparison of the polarization of the emission and of the interstellar
polarization on selected lines of sight probed by stars provides unique new
diagnostics of the emission and light scattering properties of dust. Using
ancillary catalogues of interstellar polarization and extinction of starlight,
we obtain the degree of polarization, $p_V$ , and the optical depth in the V
band to the star, $\tau_V$. Toward these stars we measure the submillimetre
polarized intensity, $P_S$, and total intensity, $I_S$, in the Planck 353 GHz
channel. For those lines of sight through the diffuse interstellar medium with
comparable values of the estimated column density and polarization directions
close to orthogonal, we correlate properties in the submillimetre and visible
to find two ratios, $R_{S/V} = (P_S/I_S)/(p_V/\tau_V)$ and $R_{P/p} = P_S/p_V$
, the latter focusing directly on the polarization properties of the aligned
grain population alone. We find $R_{S/V}$ = 4.2, with statistical and
systematic uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, and $R_{P/p}$ = 5.4 MJy
sr$^{-1}$, with uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3 MJy sr$^{-1}$, respectively. Our
estimate of $R_{S/V}$ is compatible with predictions based on a range of
polarizing dust models that have been developed for the diffuse interstellar
medium. However, our estimate of $R_{P/p}$ is not compatible with predictions,
which are too low by a factor of about 2.5. This more discriminating
diagnostic, $R_{P/p}$, indicates that changes to the optical properties in the
models of the aligned grain population are required.

frequencies with unprecedented sensitivity. We make use of the Planck 353 GHz
I, Q, and U Stokes maps as dust templates, and cross-correlate them with the
Planck and WMAP data at 12 frequencies from 23 to 353 GHz, over circular
patches with 10 degree radius. The cross-correlation analysis is performed for
both intensity and polarization data in a consistent manner. We use a mask that
focuses our analysis on the diffuse interstellar medium at intermediate
Galactic latitudes. We determine the spectral indices of dust emission in
intensity and polarization between 100 and 353 GHz, for each sky-patch. The
mean values, $1.59\pm0.02$ for polarization and $1.51\pm0.01$ for intensity,
for a mean dust temperature of 19.6 K, are close, but significantly different
($3.6\,\sigma$). We determine the mean spectral energy distribution (SED) of
the microwave emission, correlated with the 353 GHz dust templates, by
averaging the results of the correlation over all sky-patches. We find that the
mean SED increases for decreasing frequencies at $\nu < 60$ GHz, for both
intensity and polarization. The rise of the polarization SED towards low
frequencies may be accounted for by a synchrotron component correlated with
dust, with no need for any polarization of the anomalous microwave emission. We
use a spectral model to separate the synchrotron and dust polarization and to
characterize the spectral dependence of the dust polarization fraction. The
polarization fraction ($p$) of the dust emission decreases by $(21\pm6)$ % from
353 to 70 GHz. The decrease of $p$ could indicate differences in polarization
efficiency among components of interstellar dust (e.g., carbon versus silicate
grains). Our observational results provide inputs to quantify and optimize the
separation between Galactic and cosmological polarization.

is that our Galois-connection provides a pair of computable, interpreting

field spectroscopy (IFS) observations of the SQ from the PPAK IFS Nearby

The nature of the gas emission is analysed using 2D maps of
continuum-subtracted, pure emission-line intensities, stacked spectra,
diagnostic diagrams, and photoionization model predictions. In the case of NGC
7319, we study the galaxy-wide high-velocity outflow emission by comparing the
emission properties with theoretical shock and AGN models. We conclude that the
excitation mechanism of the gas in this galaxy is a mixture of AGN
photoionization and shocks with a photoionizing precursor. The emission spectra
from the large scale shock front in the interacting pair NGC 7318A/B is
analysed, confirming the presence of several kinematic components. Comparison
with predictions from theoretical shock models suggests that the gas emission
is consistent with shocks without a photoionizing precursor, low pre-shock
density, and velocities in the range of 200 - 400 km s-1. The gas oxygen
abundance for NGC 7318B is determined using an updated O3N2 calibration.
Although NGC 7317 shows no significant gas emission, an ionizing cluster is
found southwest of this galaxy, probably the result of tidal interaction. As a
by-product, we analyse the gas emission of the foreground galaxy NGC 7320.

plumes. In a forward approach, the model is able to simulate the plume dynamics
from prescribed input flow conditions and generate the corresponding synthetic
thermal infrared (TIR) image, allowing a comparison with field-based
observations. An inversion procedure is then developed to retrieve ash plume
properties from TIR images.
  The adopted fluid-dynamic model is based on a one-dimensional, stationary
description of a self-similar (top-hat) turbulent plume, for which an
asymptotic analytical solution is obtained. The electromagnetic
emission/absorption model is based on the Schwarzschild's equation and on Mie's
theory for disperse particles, assuming that particles are coarser than the
radiation wavelength and neglecting scattering. [...]
  Application of the inversion procedure to an ash plume at Santiaguito volcano
(Guatemala) has allowed us to retrieve the main plume input parameters, namely
the initial radius $b_0$, velocity $U_0$, temperature $T_0$, gas mass ratio
$n_0$, entrainment coefficient $k$ and their related uncertainty. Moreover,
coupling with the electromagnetic model, we have been able to obtain a reliable
estimate of the equivalent Sauter diameter $d_s$ of the total particle size
distribution.
  The presented method is general and, in principle, can be applied to the
spatial distribution of particle concentration and temperature obtained by any
fluid-dynamic model, either integral or multidimensional, stationary or
time-dependent, single or multiphase. The method discussed here is fast and
robust, thus indicating potential for applications to real-time estimation of
ash mass flux and particle size distribution, which is crucial for model-based

Polyanskiy-Poor-Verd\'{u}. We evaluate our bounds for the binary symmetric and

consider two questions related to the practical construction of UMP codes.
First, we study a ""header"" construction that prefixes the message class into a
header followed by data protection using a standard homogeneous code. We show
that, in general, this construction is not optimal at finite block lengths. We
further demonstrate that our main UMP achievability bound can be obtained using

polarization mapping reveals that Sgr B2 and Sgr C, situated at the two sides
of the CMZ, present the highest polarization degrees (66.5 and 47.8 per cent
respectively), both associated with a polarization position angle psi = 90deg
(normal to the scattering plane). The CND shows a lower polarization degree,
1.0 per cent with psi = -20.5deg, tracing the inclination of the CND with
respect to the Galactic plane. The CMZ polarization is spatially variable. We
also consider a range of spatial locations for Sgr A* and the reprocessing
media, and investigate how the modeled three-dimensional geometry influences
the resulting GC polarization. The two reflection nebulae are found to always
produce high polarization degrees (>> 10 per cent). We show that a 500 ks
observation with a broadband polarimeter could constrain the location and the
morphology of the scattering material with respect to the emitting source,

transportation has been increasing and driving has become an important part of
daily life. Driving is a multi-sensory experience as drivers rely on their
senses to provide them with important information. In a vehicular context human
senses are all too often limited and obstructed. Today, road accidents
constitute the eighth leading cause of death. The escalation of technology has
propelled new ways in which driver's senses may be augmented. The enclosed
aspect of a car, allied with the configuration of the controls and displays
directed towards the driver, offer significant advantages for augmented reality
(AR) systems when considering the amount of immersion it can provide to the
user. In addition, the inherent mobility and virtually unlimited power autonomy
transform cars into perfect mobile computing platforms. However, automobiles
currently present limited network connectivity and thus the created augmented
objects are merely providing information captured by in-vehicle sensors,
cameras and other databases. By combining the new paradigm of Vehicular Ad Hoc
Networking (VANET) with AR human machine interfaces, we show that it is
possible to design novel cooperative Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS),
that base the creation of AR content on the information collected from
neighbouring vehicles or roadside infrastructures. As such we implement
prototypes of both visual and acoustic AR systems, which can significantly
improve the driving experience. We believe our results contribute to the
formulation of a vision where the vehicle is perceived as an extension of the
body which permeates the human senses to the world outside the vessel, where
the car is used as a better, multi-sensory immersive version of a mobile phone

especially in high dimensions. The main advantage of this algorithm is that it
simultaneously updates all components of a high dimensional parameter by some
appropriate deterministic transformation of a single random variable, thereby
reducing time complexity and enhancing the acceptance rate. The optimal scaling
of the additive TMCMC approach has already been studied for the Gaussian
proposal density by Dey and Bhattacharya(2013). In this paper, we discuss
diffusion-based optimal scaling behavior for non-Gaussian proposal densities -
in particular, uniform, Student's t and Cauchy proposals. We also consider
diffusion based optimal scaling for non-Gaussian proposals when the target
density is discontinuous. In the case of the Random Walk metropolis (RWM)
algorithm these non-regular situations have been studied by Neal and Roberts
(2011) in terms of expected squared jumping distance (ESJD), but the diffusion
based approach has not been considered. Although we could not formally prove
our diffusion result for the Cauchy proposal, simulation based results led us
to a conjecture that the diffusion result still holds for the Cauchy case. We
compare our diffusion based TMCMC approach with that of ESJD based RWM approach
for the very challenging Cauchy proposal case, showing that our former approach
clearly outperforms the latter.

suppressed and the minigap begins to develop. In the diffusive limit, the
minigap is fully restored and all signatures of the bound state are eliminated.
We find that an interfacial potential barrier does not change the functional
form of the density of states peak but does shift this peak away from zero
energy.

  update: final formatting edits for journal submission, condensed figures",,,,"stat.ME stat.AP stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many have suggested a bootstrap procedure for estimating the sampling
variability of principal component analysis (PCA) results. However, when the
number of measurements per subject ($p$) is much larger than the number of
subjects ($n$), the challenge of calculating and storing the leading principal
components from each bootstrap sample can be computationally infeasible. To
address this, we outline methods for fast, exact calculation of bootstrap
principal components, eigenvalues, and scores. Our methods leverage the fact
that all bootstrap samples occupy the same $n$-dimensional subspace as the
original sample. As a result, all bootstrap principal components are limited to
the same $n$-dimensional subspace and can be efficiently represented by their
low dimensional coordinates in that subspace. Several uncertainty metrics can
be computed solely based on the bootstrap distribution of these low dimensional
coordinates, without calculating or storing the $p$-dimensional bootstrap
components. Fast bootstrap PCA is applied to a dataset of sleep
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings ($p=900$, $n=392$), and to a dataset of
brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) ($p\approx$ 3 million, $n=352$). For the
brain MRI dataset, our method allows for standard errors for the first 3
principal components based on 1000 bootstrap samples to be calculated on a
standard laptop in 47 minutes, as opposed to approximately 4 days with standard
methods.

binary system consisting of two B-type stars residing in an eccentric orbit.
The more massive primary component is a Beta Cep-type pulsating variable star.
Our analysis is based on a time-series of some 1000 high-resolution spectra
collected with the CORALIE spectrograph in 2006, 2007, and 2008. We use two
different approaches to determine the orbital parameters of the star; the
spectral disentangling technique is used to separate the spectral contributions
of the individual components in the composite spectra. The non-LTE based
spectrum analysis of the disentangled spectra reveals two stars of similar
spectral type and atmospheric chemical composition. Combined with the orbital
inclination angle estimate found in the literature, our orbital elements allow
a mass estimate of 14.7 +/- 4.5 and 9.5 +/- 2.9 solar mass for the primary and
secondary component, respectively. The primary component is found to pulsate in
three independent modes, of which two are identified as fundamental and second
overtone radial modes, while the third is an l = 1 non-radial mode. Seismic
modelling of the pulsating component refines stellar parameters to 13.5
+0.5/-1.4 and 8.7 +0.6/-1.2 solar mass, and delivers radii of 8.95 +0.43/-0.66

differs greatly from that in the local universe. In contrast to the local
universe, core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are the only source of
thermally-condensed dust. Because of the low initial dust-to-gas mass ratio,
grain destruction rates are low, so that CCSNe are net producers of
interstellar dust. Galaxies with large initial gas mass or high mass infall
rate will therefore have a more rapid net rate of dust production comported to
galaxies with lower gas mass, even at the same star formation rate. The dust
composition is dominated by silicates, which exhibit a strong rise in the UV
opacity near the Lyman break. This ""silicate-UV break"" may be confused with the
Lyman break, resulting in a misidentification of a galaxies' photometric
redshift. In this paper we demonstrate these effects by analyzing the spectral
energy distribution (SED) of MACS1149-JD, a lensed galaxy at z=9.6. A potential
2mm counterpart of MACS1149-JD has been identified with GISMO. While additional
observations are required to corroborate this identification, we use this

hypothesis that the noise, with finite second order statistics, can be
represented in a given deterministic basis by random coefficients. An extended
underdetermined design matrix is then considered and an estimator of the
extended parameters is proposed with minimum $l_1$ norm. It is proved that if
the noise variance is larger than a threshold, which depends on the unknown
parameters and on the extended design matrix, then the proposed estimator of
the original parameters dominates the least-squares estimator in the sense of
the mean square error. A small simulation illustrates the behavior of the
proposed estimator. Moreover it is shown experimentally that the proposed

estimate can be used. Furthermore the noise basis can eventually be used to
introduce some prior information in the estimation process. These points are

only an amount of memory cells (memprocessors) that grows polynomially with the

optimization deals with finding the values of input parameters of a complex

simulation of fuzzy logic traffic controller for controlling flow of traffic in
isolated intersections. This controller is based on the waiting time and queue
length of vehicles at present green phase and vehicles queue lengths at the
other phases. The controller controls the traffic light timings and phase
difference to ascertain sebaceous flow of traffic with least waiting time and
queue length. In this paper, the isolated intersection model used consists of
two alleyways in each approach. Every outlook has different value of queue
length and waiting time, systematically, at the intersection. The maximum value
of waiting time and vehicle queue length has to be selected by using proximity
sensors as inputs to controller for the ameliorate control traffic flow at the
intersection. An intelligent traffic model and fuzzy logic traffic controller
are developed to evaluate the performance of traffic controller under different
pre-defined conditions for oleaginous flow of traffic. Additionally, this fuzzy

detect all of anomaly data which appear differently in high dimensional space.
To cope with this problem, we propose a new k-nearest section-based method
(k-NS) in a section-based space. Our proposed approach not only detects
outliers in low dimensional space with section-density ratio but also detects
outliers in high dimensional space with the ratio of k-nearest section against
average value. After taking a series of experiments with the dimension from 10
to 10000, the experiment results show that our proposed method achieves 100%
precision and 100% recall result in the case of extremely high dimensional
space, and better improvement in low dimensional space compared to our
previously proposed method.

galaxy) is a Guaranteed Time Observation survey being performed at the VST (the
ESO VLT Survey Telescope). STEP will image an area of 74 deg$^2$ covering the
main body of the Small Magellanic Cloud (32 deg$^2$), the Bridge that connects
it to the Large Magellanic Cloud (30 deg$^2$) and a small part of the
Magellanic Stream (2 deg$^2$). Our $g,r,i,H_{\alpha}$ photometry is able to
resolve individual stars down to magnitudes well below the main-sequence
turnoff of the oldest populations. In this first paper we describe the
observing strategy, the photometric techniques, and the upcoming data products
of the survey. We also present preliminary results for the first two fields for
which data acquisition is completed, including some detailed analysis of the
two stellar clusters IC\,1624 and NGC\,419.

a photometric analysis of 67 ISFOs in a sample of 14 interacting systems is
presented. The majority of the ISFOs have relative polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon (PAH) band strengths similar to those of nearby spiral and
starburst galaxies. In contrast to what is observed in blue compact dwarfs
(BCDs) and local giant HII regions in the Milky Way (NGC 3603) and the
Magellanic Clouds (30 Doradus and N 66), the relative PAH band strengths in
ISFOs correspond to models with a significant PAH ion fraction (<50%) and
bright emission from large PAHs (~100 carbon atoms). The [NeIII]/[NeII] and
[SIV]/[SIII] line flux ratios indicate moderate levels of excitation with an
interstellar radiation field that is harder than the majority of the Spitzer
Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey and starburst galaxies, but softer than BCDs
and local giant HII regions. The ISFO neon line flux ratios are consistent with
a burst of star formation < 6 million years ago. Most of the ISFOs have
~million solar masses of warm molecular hydrogen with a likely origin in
photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). Infrared Array Camera photometry shows the
ISFOs to be bright at 8 um, with one third having [4.5] - [8.0] > 3.7, i.e.,
enhanced non-stellar emission, most likely due to PAHs, relative to normal
spirals, dwarf irregulars and BCD galaxies. The relative strength of the 8 um
emission compared to that at 3.6 um or 24 um separates ISFOs from dwarf
galaxies in Spitzer two color diagrams. The infrared power in two thirds of the
ISFOs is dominated by emission from grains in a diffuse interstellar medium.
One in six ISFOs have significant emission from PDRs, contributing ~30 % - 60 %
of the total power. ISFOs are young knots of intense star formation.

of a music playback device, a common portable speaker with four small
loudspeakers in close proximity to one microphone. The user controls the device
through voice, where the speech-to-music ratio can be as low as -30 dB during
music playback. We propose a speech enhancement front-end that relies on known
robust methods for echo cancellation, double-talk detection, and noise
suppression, as well as a novel adaptive quasi-binary mask that is well suited
for speech recognition. The optimization of the system is then formulated as a
large scale nonlinear programming problem where the recognition rate is
maximized and the optimal values for the system parameters are found through a
genetic algorithm. We validate our methodology by testing over the TIMIT
database for different music playback levels and noise types. Finally, we show
that the proposed front-end allows a natural interaction with the device for
limited-vocabulary voice commands.

beginning with smaller digits appear more frequently than those with larger

services, total literature and individual magazines distributed, new

flavors. This model is based on global chiral symmetry and dilatation
invariance and includes, besides scalar and pseudoscalar mesons, vector and
axial-vector mesons. Most of the parameters of the model have been determined
in previous work by fitting properties of mesons with three quark flavors. Only
three new parameters, all related to the current charm quark mass, appear when
introducing charmed mesons. Surprisingly, within the accuracy expected from our
approach, the masses of open charmed mesons turn out to be in quantitative
agreement with experimental data. On the other hand, with the exception of
$J/\psi$, the masses of charmonia are underpredicted by about 10\%. It is
remarkable that our approach correctly predicts (within errors) the mass
splitting between spin-0 and spin-1 negative-parity open charm states. This
indicates that, although the charm quark mass breaks chiral symmetry quite
strongly explicitly, this symmetry still seems to have some influence on the
properties of charmed mesons.

generations has emerged in that framework. This idea is worked out in detail
here by accommodating the fermion masses and mixings to microscopic parameters.
The top quark mass can be given in terms of the Fermi scale and of certain
exchange couplings of isospin vectors obeying a tetrahedral symmetry. The
observed hierarchy in the family spectrum is attributed to a natural hierarchy
in the microscopic couplings. The neutrinos will be shown to vibrate within the
potential valleys of the system, thus retaining very tiny masses. This is
related to a Goldstone effect inside the internal dynamics. A discussion of the
quark and lepton mixing matrices is also included. The mixing angles of the
PMNS matrix are calculated for an example set of parameters, and a value for
the CP violating phase is given.
