has been developed and constructed for use with TRIUMF's Ion Trap for Atomic
and Nuclear science (TITAN). This device consists of an open-access
electron-beam ion-trap (EBIT), which is surrounded radially by seven low-energy
planar Si(Li) detectors. The environment of the EBIT allows for the detection
of low-energy photons by providing backing-free storage of the radioactive
ions, while guiding charged decay particles away from the trap centre via the
strong (up to 6 T) magnetic field. In addition to excellent ion confinement and
storage, the EBIT also provides a venue for performing decay spectroscopy on
highly-charged radioactive ions. Recent technical advancements have been able
to provide a significant increase in sensitivity for low-energy photon
detection, towards the goal of measuring weak electron-capture branching ratios
of the intermediate nuclei in the two-neutrino double beta ($2\nu\beta\beta$)
decay process. The design, development, and commissioning of this apparatus are
presented together with the main physics objectives. The future of the device
and experimental technique are discussed.

hyperparameters, and training set that were used. Previous results are
particularly important for meta-learning, which, in a broad sense, is the
process of learning from previous machine learning results such that the
learning process is improved. While other experiment databases do exist, one of
our focuses is on easy access to the data. We provide meta-learning data sets
that are ready to be downloaded for meta-learning experiments. In addition,
queries to the underlying database can be made if specific information is
desired. We also differ from previous experiment databases in that our
databases is designed at the instance level, where an instance is an example in
a data set. We store the predictions of a learning algorithm trained on a
specific training set for each instance in the test set. Data set level
information can then be obtained by aggregating the results from the instances.
The instance level information can be used for many tasks such as determining
the diversity of a classifier or algorithmically determining the optimal subset

close to the instability threshold, sulci appear as I-shaped lines aligned
orthogonally with their neighbors; at higher compressions they are Y-shaped and

phase transition (QPT) from a strong coupling, Fermi liquid phase to a

is to establish what can be shown exactly about such `local moment' (LM)
phases; of which the permanent (zero-field) local magnetization is a hallmark,
and an order parameter for the QPT. A description of the zero-field LM phase is
shown to require two distinct self-energies, which reflect the broken symmetry
nature of the phase and together determine the single self-energy of standard
field theory. Distinct Friedel sum rules for each phase are obtained, via a
Luttinger theorem embodied in the vanishing of appropriate Luttinger integrals.
By contrast, the standard Luttinger integral is non-zero in the LM phase, but
found to have universal magnitude. A range of spin susceptibilites are also
considered; including that corresponding to the local order parameter, whose
exact form is shown to be RPA-like, and to diverge as the QPT is approached.
Particular attention is given to the pseudogap Anderson model, including the
basic physical picture of the transition, the low-energy behavior of
single-particle dynamics, the quantum critical point itself, and the rather
subtle effect of an applied local field. A two-level impurity model which
undergoes a QPT (`singlet-triplet') to an underscreened LM phase is also
considered, for which we derive on general grounds some key results for the
zero-bias conductance in both phases.

for close to three decades. A significant fraction of this work focuses on
lower bounds for basic communication problems such as wake-up (symmetry
breaking among an unknown set of nodes) and broadcast (message dissemination
through an unknown network topology). In this paper, we introduce a new
technique for proving this type of bound, based on reduction from a
probabilistic hitting game, that simplifies and strengthens much of this
existing work. In more detail, in this single paper we prove new expected time
and high probability lower bounds for wake-up and global broadcast in single
and multichannel versions of the radio network model both with and without
collision detection. In doing so, we are able to reproduce results that
previously spanned a half-dozen papers published over a period of twenty-five
years. In addition to simplifying these existing results, our technique, in
many places, also improves the state of the art: of the eight bounds we prove,
four strictly strengthen the best known previous result (in terms of time
complexity and/or generality of the algorithm class for which it holds), and
three provide the first known non-trivial bound for the case in question. The
fact that the same technique can easily generate this diverse collection of
lower bounds indicates a surprising unity underlying communication tasks in the

problem definition and model assumptions, communication in this setting reduces
to finding efficient strategies for a simple game.

deprojected length of the bar of 2.5 kpc. The bar's strength, as derived from
the curvature of the dust lanes in the J-Ks image, is typical of weak bars.
From the deprojected length of the bar, we establish the corotation radius
(R_CR=3 kpc) and bar pattern speed (Omega_b = 61.3 km /s kpc), which provides
the connection between the high-frequency structures in the disk and the
orbital resonances induced by the bar. The nuclear ring is located at the inner
Lindblad resonance. The second ring does not have a resonant origin, but it
could be a merger remnant or a transient structure formed during an
intermediate stage of the bar formation. The inferred bar pattern speed places
the outer Lindblad resonance within the optical disk at 4.9 kpc, in the same
radial range as the peak in the HI surface density. The disk of NGC253 has a
down-bending profile with a break at R~9.3 kpc, which corresponds to about 3
times the scale length of the inner disk. We discuss the evidence for a
threshold in star formation efficiency as a possible explanation of the steep
gradient in the surface brightness profile at large radii. The NIR photometry
unveils the dynamical response of the NGC253 stellar disk to its central bar.
The formation of the bar may be related to the merger event that determined the
truncation of stars and gas at large radii and the perturbation of the disk's
outer edge.

core nucleated accretion and gas capture. The core begins as a seed body of
about 350 kilometers in radius and orbits in a swarm of planetesimals whose
initial radii range from 15 meters to 50 kilometers. The evolution of the swarm
accounts for growth and fragmentation, viscous and gravitational stirring, and
for drag-assisted migration and velocity damping. During this evolution, less

substantially enhances the size-dependent cross-section of the planet for
accretion of planetesimals. The calculation of dust opacity in the planet's
envelope accounts for coagulation and sedimentation of dust particles released
as planetesimals are ablated. The calculation is carried out at an orbital

Superposition T-matrix code, JaSTA (Java Superposition T-matrix App), to study
the light scattering properties of aggregate structures. It has been developed
using Netbeans 7.1.2, which is a java integrated development environment (IDE).
The JaSTA uses double precession superposition codes for multi-sphere clusters
in random orientation developed by Mackowski and Mischenko (1996). It consists
of a graphical user interface (GUI) in the front hand and a database of related
data in the back hand. Both the interactive GUI and database package directly
enable a user to model by self-monitoring respective input parameters (namely,
wavelength, complex refractive indices, grain size, etc.) to study the related
optical properties of cosmic dust (namely, extinction, polarization, etc.)
instantly, i.e., with zero computational time. This increases the efficiency of
the user. The database of JaSTA is now created for a few sets of input
parameters with a plan to create a large database in future. This application
also has an option where users can compile and run the scattering code directly
for aggregates in GUI environment. The JaSTA aims to provide convenient and
quicker data analysis of the optical properties which can be used in different
fields like planetary science, atmospheric science, nano science, etc. The
current version of this software is developed for the Linux and Windows
platform to study the light scattering properties of small aggregates which
will be extended for larger aggregates using parallel codes in future.

high-throughput short-read sequencing of cDNA. However, as ongoing advances are
rapidly yielding increasing read lengths, a technical hurdle remains in
identifying the degree to which differences in read length influence various

that, while the current long-read protocol is considerably more expensive than
short-read sequencing, there are important benefits that can only be achieved
with longer read length, including lower mapping bias and reduced ambiguity in

to their potential of achieving high performance and energy efficiency compared
to the homogeneous multicore architectures. In such systems, the real-time
scheduling problem becomes more challenging in that processors have different
speeds. A job executing on a processor with speed $x$ for $t$ time units
completes $(x \cdot t)$ units of execution. Prior research on heterogeneous
multiprocessor real-time scheduling has focused on hard real-time systems,
where, significant processing capacity may have to be sacrificed in the
worst-case to ensure that all deadlines are met. As meeting hard deadlines is
overkill for many soft real-time systems in practice, this paper shows that on
soft real-time heterogeneous multiprocessors, bounded response times can be
ensured for globally-scheduled sporadic task systems with no utilization loss.
A GEDF-based scheduling algorithm, namely GEDF-H, is presented and response
time bounds are established under both preemptive and non-preemptive GEDF-H
scheduling. Extensive experiments show that the magnitude of the derived
response time bound is reasonable, often smaller than three task periods. To

precursor arising from magnetic field amplification by cosmic rays. We estimate
the depth of such a precursor under conditions of nonresonant amplification,
which can provide magnetic field strengths comparable to those inferred for
supernova remnants. Magnetic field generation occurs as the streaming cosmic
rays induce a plasma return current, and may be quenched either by nonresonant
or resonant channels. In the case of nonresonant saturation, the cosmic rays
become magnetized and amplification saturates at higher magnetic fields. The
precursor can extend out to $10^{17} - 10^{18}$ cm and is potentially
detectable. If resonant saturation occurs, the cosmic rays are scattered by
turbulence and the precursor length will likely be much smaller.
  The dependence of precursor length on shock velocity has implications for
electron heating. In the case of resonant saturation, this dependence is
similar to that in the more familiar resonantly generated shock precursor,
which when expressed in terms of the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient
$\varkappa $ and shock velocity $v_s$ is $\varkappa /v_s$. In the nonresonantly
saturated case, the precursor length declines less quickly with increasing
$v_s$. Where precursor length proportional to $1/v_s$ gives constant electron
heating, this increased precursor length could be expected to lead to higher
electron temperatures for nonresonant amplification. This should be expected at
faster supernova remnant shocks than studied by previous works. Existing
results and new data analysis of SN 1006 and Cas A suggest some observational
support for this idea.

optical lattice in the presence of incoherent light scattering. Deriving and
solving a master equation to describe this process microscopically for many
particles, we observe contrasting behaviour in terms of the robustness against
this type of heating for different many-body states. In particular, we find
that the magnetic correlations exhibited by a two-component gas in the Mott
insulating phase should be particularly robust against decoherence from light
scattering, because the decoherence in the lowest band is suppressed by a
larger factor than the timescales for effective superexchange interactions that
drive coherent dynamics. Furthermore, the derived formalism naturally
generalizes to analogous states with SU(N) symmetry. In contrast, for typical
atomic and laser parameters, two-particle correlation functions describing
bound dimers for strong attractive interactions exhibit superradiant effects
due to the indistinguishability of off-resonant photons scattered by atoms in
different internal states. This leads to rapid decay of correlations describing
off-diagonal long-range order for these states. Our predictions should be
directly measurable in ongoing experiments, providing a basis for
characterising and controlling heating processes in quantum simulation with

an elliptic shape freely moving in two dimensional shear flow by direct
numerical simulation. An elliptic shape cylinder in shear flow, when initially
being placed at the middle between two walls, either keeps rotating or has a
stationary inclination angle depending on the particle Reynolds number $Re=G_r
r_a^2/\nu$, where $G_r$ is the shear rate, $r_a$ is the semi-long axis of the
elliptic cylinder and $\nu$ is the kinetic viscosity of the fluid. The critical
particle Reynolds number $Re_{cr}$ for the transition from a rotating motion to
a stationary orientation depends on the aspect ratio $AR=r_b/r_a$ and the
confined ratio $K=2r_a/H$ where $r_b$ is the semi-short axis of the elliptic
cylinder and $H$ is the distance between two walls. Although the increasing of
either parameters makes an increase in $Re_{cr}$, the dynamic mechanism is
distinct. The $AR$ variation causes the change of geometry shape; however, the
$K$ variation influences the wall effect. The stationary inclination angle of
non-rotating slender elliptic cylinder with smaller confined ratio seems to
depend only on the value of $Re-Re_{cr}$. An expected equilibrium position of
the cylinder mass center in shear flow is the centerline between two walls, but
when placing the particle away from the centerline initially, it migrates
either toward an equilibrium height away from the middle between two walls or
back to the middle depending on the confined ratio and particle Reynolds
number.

parameters at a point on the shock surface. The parameters are the gas

directions of the streamline and normal to it, and of the shock surface and

expressed through the flow nonisobaric factor along the streamline, the
streamline curvature, and the flow vorticity and non-isoenthalpy factors. An
algorithm for these factors of the gas flow downstream a shock wave
determination is developed. Examples of these factors calculation for imperfect

calculated. As an illustration for flows with upstream Mach number 5 it is
shown that the flow vorticity factor is the most influenced by the

models that are parametrized by sufficient statistics based on structural
(i.e., graph-theoretic) properties. The ergm package for the R statistical
computing system is a collection of tools for the analysis of network data
within an ERGM framework. Many different network properties can be employed as
sufficient statistics for ERGMs by using the model terms defined in the ergm
package; this functionality can be expanded by the creation of packages that
code for additional network statistics. Here, our focus is on the addition of
statistics based on graphlets. Graphlets are small, connected, and
non-isomorphic induced subgraphs that describe the topological structure of a
network. We introduce an R package called ergm.graphlets that enables the use
of graphlet properties of a network within the ergm package of R. The
ergm.graphlets package provides a complete list of model terms that allows to
incorporate statistics of any 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-node graphlet into ERGMs. The
new model terms of ergm.graphlets package enable both ERG modelling of global
structural properties and investigation of relationships between nodal
attributes (i.e., covariates) and local topologies around nodes.

pattern in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and has interpreted the
measurement as evidence for primordial gravitational waves. Motivated by the
profound importance of the discovery of gravitational waves from the early
Universe, we examine to what extent a combination of Galactic foregrounds and
lensed E-modes could be responsible for the signal. We reanalyze the BICEP2
results and show that the 100x150 GHz and 150x150 GHz data are consistent with
a cosmology with r=0.2 and negligible foregrounds, but also with a cosmology
with r=0 and a significant dust polarization signal. We give independent
estimates of the dust polarization signal in the BICEP2 region using four
different approaches. While these approaches are consistent with each other,
the expected amplitude of the dust polarization power spectrum remains
uncertain by about a factor of three. The lower end of the prediction leaves
room for a primordial contribution, but at the higher end the dust in
combination with the standard CMB lensing signal could account for the BICEP2
observations, without requiring the existence of primordial gravitational
waves. By measuring the cross-correlations between the pre-Planck templates
used in the BICEP2 analysis and between different versions of a data-based
template, we emphasize that cross-correlations between models are very
sensitive to noise in the polarization angles and that measured
cross-correlations are likely underestimates of the contribution of foregrounds
to the map. These results suggest that BICEP1 and BICEP2 data alone cannot
distinguish between foregrounds and a primordial gravitational wave signal, and
that future Keck Array observations at 100 GHz and Planck observations at
higher frequencies will be crucial to determine whether the signal is of
primordial origin. (abridged)

also shown advantageous convergence properties and remarkable robustness. The
detection process is considered similar to a combinational optimization
problem. The algorithm uses the combination of three edge points as parameters
to determine circles candidates in the scene yielding a reduction of the search
space. The objective function determines if some circle candidates are actually
present in the image. This paper focuses particularly on one DE-based algorithm
known as the Discrete Differential Evolution (DDE), which eventually has shown
better results than the original DE in particular for solving combinatorial
problems. In the DDE, suitable conversion routines are incorporated into the
DE, aiming to operate from integer values to real values and then getting
integer values back, following the crossover operation. The final algorithm is
a fast circle detector that locates circles with sub-pixel accuracy even

several synthetic and natural images with varying range of complexity validate
the efficiency of the proposed technique considering accuracy, speed, and

young population is present mainly in the western half of the MBR, which,

a continuous stream of stars connecting both galaxies along Dec ~ -73.5 deg.
The young population distribution is clumped, with one of the major densities
close to the SMC, and the other, fairly isolated and located approximately
mid-way between the Clouds, which we call the OGLE island. These overdensities
are well matched by HI surface density contours, although the newly found young

density contour. We observe a continuity of red clump stars between the

stars are present mainly in the southern and central parts of the Magellanic
Bridge, below its gaseous part, and their presence is reflected by a strong
deviation from the radial density profiles of the two galaxies. This may
indicate either a tidal stream of stars, or that the stellar halos of the two
galaxies overlap. On the other hand, we do not observe such an overlap within

model systematically overestimates their collapse times. If one imposes that
halo collapse takes place at z_id, this model requires starting from a
significantly lower linear density contrast than what is measured in the

discrepancy by testing two key assumptions of the model. First, we show that
the tides felt by collapsing haloes due to the surrounding large-scale
structure evolve non-linearly. Although this effect becomes increasingly
important for low-mass haloes, accounting for it in the ellipsoidal collapse
model only marginally improves the agreement with N-body simulations. Second,
we track the time evolution of the physical volume occupied by forming haloes

redshift, z_c>z_id, contrary to the basic assumption of extended
Press-Schechter theory based on excursion sets. We discuss the implications of
this result for understanding the origin of the mass-dependence and scatter in
the linear threshold for halo formation. Finally, we show that, when tuned for
collapse at z_c, a modified version of the ellipsoidal collapse model that also

the environment of the first stars to explore the first episodes of chemical
enrichment that occurred during the dark ages. Based on these calculations, we
propose a novel explanation for the increased prevalence of carbon-enhanced
metal-poor (CEMP) stars with decreasing Fe abundance: The observed chemistry
for the most metal-poor Galactic halo stars is the result of an intimate link
between the explosions of the first stars and their host minihalo's ability to
retain its gas. Specifically, high-energy supernovae produce a near solar ratio
of C/Fe, but are effective in evacuating the gas from their host minihalo,
thereby suppressing the formation of a second generation of stars. On the other
hand, minihalos that host low-energy supernovae are able to retain their gas
and form a second stellar generation but, as a result, the second stars are
born with a supersolar ratio of C/Fe. Our models are able to accurately
reproduce the observed distributions of [C/Fe] and [Fe/H], as well as the
fraction of CEMP stars relative to non-CEMP stars as a function of [Fe/H]
without any free parameters. We propose that the present lack of chemical
evidence for very massive stars (>140 Msun), that ended their lives as a highly
energetic pair-instability supernova, does not imply that such stars were rare
or did not exist; the chemical products of these very massive first stars may
have escaped from their host minihalo, and were never incorporated into
subsequent generations of stars. Finally, our models suggest that the most
Fe-poor stars currently known may have seen the enrichment from a small
multiple of metal-free stars, and need not have been exclusively enriched by a
solitary first star. These calculations support the idea that some of the

present-day annihilation of DM in the galactic center produces boosted stable
particles in the dark sector. These stable particles are typically a
subdominant DM component, but because they are produced with a large Lorentz
boost in this process, they can be detected in large volume terrestrial
experiments via neutral-current-like interactions with electrons or nuclei.
This novel DM signal thus combines the production mechanism associated with
indirect detection experiments (i.e. galactic DM annihilation) with the
detection mechanism associated with direct detection experiments (i.e. DM
scattering off terrestrial targets). Such processes are generically present in
multi-component DM scenarios or those with non-minimal DM stabilization
symmetries. As a proof of concept, we present a model of two-component thermal
relic DM, where the dominant heavy DM species has no tree-level interactions
with the standard model and thus largely evades direct and indirect DM bounds.
Instead, its thermal relic abundance is set by annihilation into a subdominant
lighter DM species, and the latter can be detected in the boosted channel via
the same annihilation process occurring today. Especially for dark sector
masses in the 10 MeV-10 GeV range, the most promising signals are electron
scattering events pointing toward the galactic center. These can be detected in
experiments designed for neutrino physics or proton decay, in particular
Super-K and its upgrade Hyper-K, as well as the PINGU/MICA extensions of
IceCube. This boosted DM phenomenon highlights the distinctive signatures
possible from non-minimal dark sectors.

post-inflationary history with a late-time matter domination period prior to
BBN. Such a cosmology could arise naturally in the well-motivated moduli
scenario in the context of supersymmetry (SUSY) -- in particular in models of
Split-SUSY. Sub-horizon dark matter perturbations grow linearly during the
matter dominated phase before reheating and can lead to an enhancement in the
growth of substructure on small scales, even in the presence of dark matter
annihilations. This suggests that a new scale (the horizon size at reheating)
could be important for determining the primordial matter power spectrum.
However, we find that in many non-thermal models free-streaming effects or
kinetic decoupling after reheating can completely erase the enhancement leading
to small-scale structures. In particular, in the moduli scenario with wino or
higgsino dark matter we find that the dark matter particles produced from
moduli decays would thermalize with radiation and kinetically decouple below
the reheating temperature. Thus, the growth of dark matter perturbations is not
sustained, and the predictions for the matter power spectrum are similar to a
standard thermal history. We comment on possible exceptions, but these appear
difficult to realize within standard moduli scenarios. We conclude that
although enhanced structure does not provide a new probe for investigating the
cosmic dark ages within these models, it does suggest that non-thermal
histories offer a robust alternative to a strictly thermal post-inflationary
history.

role in the generation of the primordial curvature perturbation $\zeta$. Such
models are interesting because the involved vector fields naturally seed
statistical anisotropy in the primordial fluctuations which could eventually
leave a measurable imprint on the cosmic microwave background fluctuations. In
this article, we estimate the scale and shape dependent effects on the
non-Gaussianity (NG) parameters due to the scale dependent statistical
anisotropy in the distribution of the fluctuations. For concreteness, we use a
power spectrum (PS) of the fluctuations of the quadrupolar form:
$P_\zeta(\vec{k})\equiv P_\zeta(k)[1+g_\zeta(k)(\hat{n} \cdot \hat{k})^2 ]$,
where $g_{\zeta}(k)$ is the only quantity which parametrizes the level of
statistical anisotropy and $\hat{n}$ is a unitary vector which points towards
the preferred direction. Then, we evaluate the contribution of the running of
$g_{\zeta}(k)$ on the NG parameters by means of the $\delta N$ formalism. We
focus specifically on the details for the $f_{\rm NL}$ NG parameter, associated
with the bispectrum $B_\zeta$, but the structure of higher order NG parameters
is straightforward to generalize. Although the level of statistical anisotropy
in the PS is severely constrained by recent observations, the importance of
statistical anisotropy signals in higher order correlators remains to be
determined, this being the main task that we address here. The precise
measurement of the shape and scale dependence (or running) of statistical
parameters such as the NG parameters and the statistical anisotropy level could
provide relevant elements for model building and for the determination of the
presence (or nonpresence) of inflationary vector fields and their role in the
inflationary mechanism.

rates obtained from UV Balmer excess modelling, optical photospheric line
veiling, and from the correlations with several emission lines spanning from

dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that last more than $10^4$ orbits

region where asymmetric features are observed, our simulation results suggest
that the disk viscous $\alpha$ needs to be low $\sim 10^{-5 }$ - $10^{-4}$ to
sustain vortices to thousands and up to $10^{4}$ orbits in certain cases. The
chance of finding a vortex feature in a disk then decreases with smaller planet
orbital radius. For $\alpha \sim 10^{-3}$ or larger, even planets with masses

is dominated by Pop III stars, the IGM quickly heats above the CMB at z > 12
due to heating from supernovae. In addition, Lyman-alpha photons from haloes
hosting Pop III stars couple the spin temperature to that of the gas, resulting
in a deep absorption signal. If the SFR is dominated by Pop II stars, the IGM
slowly heats and exceeds the CMB temperature at z ~ 10. However, the larger and

sensors is based on photo-detectors which produce photo-currents proportional
to the cosine of the incidence angle (cosine detectors), we propose an
alternative scheme where the vectorial photoelectric effect is exploited to
achieve a higher sensitivity of the sensed photo-current to the incidence

detectors in a space environment. Besides long operational lifetimes without
significant degradation, metal cathode detectors are insensitive to earth

measurements in low earth orbits. Sensitivity curves are calculated and
trade-offs performed with the aim of optimizing the sensitivity whilst also
providing currents sufficient for detection. Simple applications and detector

coupling: in the limit of a large spin or a large R-charge, the anomalous
dimension of the gauge theory operator dual to a semiclassical rotating string
is proportional to the string proper length. This conjecture is motivated by a
generalization to strings of the rule for computing anomalous dimensions of
massive particles and supergravity fields in the anti-de Sitter space. We show
that this proportionality holds for a rotating closed string in global AdS
space, representing a high spin operator made of fields in the adjoint
representation. It is also valid for closed strings rotating in $S^5$
(representing operators with large R-charge), for closed strings with multiple
AdS spin, and for giant magnons. Based on this conjecture, we calculate the
anomalous dimension $\delta$ of operators made of fields in the fundamental
representation, associated with high spin mesons, and which are represented by
rotating open strings attached to probe D7-branes. The result is a logarithmic
dependence upon the spin, $\delta\sim \sqrt{\lambda}\ln S$, similar to the
closed string case. We show that the operator properties --- anomalous
dimension and spin --- are obtained from measurements made by a local observer
in the anti-de Sitter space. For the open string case, this ensures that these
quantities are independent of the mass scale introduced by the D7-branes (the
quark mass), as expected on physical grounds. In contrast, properties of the
gauge theory states, like the energy, correspond to measurements by a gauge
theory observer and depend upon the mass scale --- once again, as expected.

represented by nonlinear stochastic differential equations. It is well-known
that the optimal control policy for this problem can be obtained as a function
of a value function that satisfies a nonlinear partial differential equation,
namely, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. This nonlinear PDE must be solved
backwards in time, and this computation is intractable for large scale systems.
Under certain assumptions, and after applying a logarithmic transformation, an
alternative characterization of the optimal policy can be given in terms of a
path integral. Path Integral (PI) based control methods have recently been
shown to provide elegant solutions to a broad class of stochastic optimal
control problems. One of the implementation challenges with this formalism is
the computation of the expectation of a cost functional over the trajectories
of the unforced dynamics. Computing such expectation over trajectories that are
sampled uniformly may induce numerical instabilities due to the exponentiation
of the cost. Therefore, sampling of low-cost trajectories is essential for the
practical implementation of PI-based methods. In this paper, we use incremental
sampling-based algorithms to sample useful trajectories from the unforced
system dynamics, and make a novel connection between Rapidly-exploring Random
Trees (RRTs) and information-theoretic stochastic optimal control. We show the
results from the numerical implementation of the proposed approach to several

particular a comparison between the organic content of meteorites and that in
identified organics in the dense interstellar medium (ISM). Based on this
accounting identified organics created by the chemistry of star formation could
contain at most ~15% of the organic carbon content in primitive meteorites and
significantly less for cometary organics, which represent the putative
contributors to starting materials for the Earth. In the ISM ~30% of the
elemental carbon is found in CO, either in the gas or ices, with a typical
abundance of ~10^-4 (relative to H2). Recent observations of the TW Hya disk
find that the gas phase abundance of CO is reduced by an order of magnitude
compared to this value. We explore a solution where the volatile CO is
destroyed via a gas phase processes, providing an additional source of carbon
for organic material to be incorporated into planetesimals and cometesimals.
This chemical processing mechanism requires warm grains (> 20 K), partially
ionized gas, and sufficiently small <10 micron grains, i.e. a larger total
grain surface area, such that freeze-out is efficient. Under these conditions
static (non-turbulent) chemical models predict that a large fraction of the

variety of organics that are present as ice coatings on the surfaces of warm
pre-planetesimal dust grains.

standard afterglow scenario, which indicates a forward shock origin. The
combination of data extending from the NIR to GeV energies suggest that the
emission is produced by a broken power-law spectrum consistent with synchrotron
radiation. The afterglow is well modelled using a stratified wind-like
environment with a density profile k~1.2, suggesting a massive star progenitor
(i.e. Wolf-Rayet). The analysis of the reverse and forward shock emission
reveals an initial Lorentz factor of ~120-340, a jet half-opening angle of
~2deg-5deg, and a baryon load of ~10^-5-10^-6 Msun consistent with the
expectations of the fireball model when the emission is highly relativistic.
Long-lasting soft gamma-ray emission from other INTEGRAL GRBs with high peak
fluxes, such as GRB 041219A, was not detected, suggesting that a combination of
high Lorentz factor, emission above 100 MeV, and possibly a powerful reverse
shock are required. Similar long-lasting soft gamma-ray emission has recently
been observed from the nearby and extremely bright Fermi/LAT burst GRB 130427A.

(a) a single host galaxy absorber at z=6.327 with log(N_HI)=18.62+/-0.08; (b)
pure intergalactic medium (IGM) absorption from z=6.0 to z=6.328 with a
constant neutral hydrogen fraction of x_HI=0.056+0.011-0.027; and (c) a hybrid
model with a host absorber located within an ionized bubble of radius 10
comoving Mpc in an IGM with x_HI=0.12+/-0.05 (x_HI<0.21 at the 2-sigma level).
Regardless of the model, the sharpness of the dropoff in transmission is
inconsistent with a substantial neutral fraction in the IGM at this redshift.
No narrow absorption lines from the host galaxy are detected, indicating a host
metallicity of [Z/H]<~ -0.8. Even if we assume that all of the hydrogen
absorption is due to the host galaxy, the column is unusually low for a GRB
sightline, similar to two out of the other three highest-redshift bursts with

ionizing photons from normal star-forming galaxies increases at z>~6.

ionizing photon mean free paths of $\simeq$50 comoving Mpc at z$\simeq$3.4,
thus requiring that a substantial volume of the helium in the Universe was
already doubly ionized at early times; this stands in conflict with current
models of HeII reionization driven by luminous quasars. Along 10 sightlines we
measure the coeval HI Ly\alpha\ effective optical depths, allowing us to study
the density dependence of \tau$_\mathsf{eff,HeII}$ at z$\sim$3. We establish
that the dependence of \tau$_\mathsf{eff,HeII}$ on increasing
\tau$_\mathsf{eff,HI}$ is significantly shallower than expected from simple
models of an IGM reionized in HeII. This requires higher HeII photoionization
rates in overdense regions or underdense regions being not in photoionization
equilibrium. Moreover, there are very large fluctuations in
\tau$_\mathsf{eff,HeII}$ at all $\tau_\mathsf{eff,HI}$, which greatly exceed
the expectations from these simple models. These data present a distinct
challenge to scenarios of HeII reionization - an IGM where HeII appears to be
predominantly ionized at z$\simeq$3.4, and with a radiation field strength that
may be correlated with the density field, but exhibits large fluctuations at
all densities.

reveals the presence of high dispersion rotating disks. The internal dynamical

0.5 Gyr (assuming a Milky Way-like CO conversion factor). These properties are
unlike those expected for low- redshift galaxies of comparable specific star

galaxies break the degeneracy between gas fraction and redshift, and we show
that the depletion time per specific star formation rate for galaxies is
closely tied to gas fraction, independent of redshift. We also show that the
gas dynamics of two of our local targets corresponds to those expected from

($\Gs$) and particle-particle ($\Gd$) interactions, a multi-fermion channel

considered. The chiral and diquark condensates are found in the mean-field
approximation for different values of the coupling constants. The parameter
values where the BCS-BEC crossover can take place are found, and the EoS is
used to identify the stability region where the BEC regime has positive
pressure. We discuss how the particle density and the repulsive diquark-diquark

profile of the pressure versus the density for various values of $\lambda$ and

compensate each other, allowing for a feasible region of densities where the
crossover can occur with positive pressure. These results, although mainly
qualitative, should serve as a preliminary step in the microscopic analysis

structure (LSS) surveys are likely to exceed statistical uncertainties of
current and future LSS data sets, potentially limiting the extraction of
cosmological information. Here we present a general framework (PCA
marginalization) to consistently incorporate systematic effects into a
likelihood analysis. This technique naturally accounts for degeneracies between
nuisance parameters and can substantially reduce the dimension of the parameter
space that needs to be sampled. As a practical application, we apply PCA
marginalization to account for baryonic physics as an uncertainty in cosmic
shear tomography. Specifically, we use CosmoLike to run simulated likelihood
analyses on three independent sets of numerical simulations, each covering a
wide range of baryonic scenarios differing in cooling, star formation, and
feedback mechanisms. We simulate a Stage III (Dark Energy Survey) and Stage IV
(Large Synoptic Survey Telescope/Euclid) survey and find a substantial bias in
cosmological constraints if baryonic physics is not accounted for. We then show
that PCA marginalization (employing at most 3 to 4 nuisance parameters) removes
this bias. Our study demonstrates that it is possible to obtain robust, precise
constraints on the dark energy equation of state even in the presence of large
levels of systematic uncertainty in astrophysical processes. We conclude that

the innermost region of such disks (a zone critical to planet formation) is
challenging for traditional observational techniques (such as near-IR imaging
and coronagraphy) due to the relatively long wavelengths involved and the area
occulted by the coronagraphic mask. Here we introduce a new instrument --
VAMPIRES -- which combines non-redundant aperture-masking interferometry with
differential polarimetry to directly image this previously inaccessible
innermost region. By using the polarisation of light scattered by dust in the
disk to provide precise differential calibration of interferometric
visibilities and closure phases, VAMPIRES allows direct imaging at and beyond
the telescope diffraction limit. Integrated into the SCExAO system at the
Subaru telescope, VAMPIRES operates at visible wavelengths (where polarisation
is high) while allowing simultaneous infrared observations conducted by HICIAO.
Here we describe the instrumental design and unique observing technique and
present the results of the first on-sky commissioning observations, validating
the excellent visibility and closure phase precision which are then used to
project expected science performance metrics.

-- direct imaging -- can access a parameter space that complements these
methods, and paves the way for future technologies capable of detailed
characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres and surfaces. However achieving
the required levels of performance with direct imaging, particularly from
ground-based telescopes which must contend with the Earth's turbulent
atmosphere, requires considerable sophistication in the instrument and
detection strategy. Here we demonstrate a new generation of photonic
pupil-remapping devices which build upon the interferometric framework
developed for the {\it Dragonfly} instrument: a high contrast waveguide-based
device which recovers robust complex visibility observables. New generation
Dragonfly devices overcome problems caused by interference from unguided light
and low throughput, promising unprecedented on-sky performance. Closure phase
measurement scatter of only $\sim 0.2^\circ$ has been achieved, with waveguide
throughputs of $> 70\%$. This translates to a maximum contrast-ratio
sensitivity (between the host star and its orbiting planet) at $1 \lambda/D$
(1$\sigma$ detection) of $5.3 \times 10^{-4}$ (when a conventional
adaptive-optics (AO) system is used) or $1.8 \times 10^{-4}$ (for typical
`extreme-AO' performance), improving even further when random error is
minimised by averaging over multiple exposures. This is an order of magnitude

eccentricity-related interaction terms. In the limit of small orbital
eccentricities, our analytic model gives explicit equations for these effects

a detection of the conjunction effect in real data is of crucial importance for
the physical characterization of planetary systems from transit timing

relation for the three kinematic components
($\sigma_R,\sigma_{\phi},\sigma_z$), the radial dependence of the velocity
dispersions, the Solar peculiar motion ($U_{\odot},V_{\odot}, W_{\odot} $), the
circular speed $\Theta_0$ at the Sun and the fall of mean azimuthal motion with
height above the mid-plane. We confirm that the Besan\c{c}on-style Gaussian
model accurately fits the GCS data, but fails to match the details of the more
spatially extended RAVE survey. In particular, the Shu distribution function
(DF) handles non-circular orbits more accurately and provides a better fit to
the kinematic data. The Gaussian distribution function not only fits the data
poorly but systematically underestimates the fall of velocity dispersion with
radius. We find that correlations exist between a number of parameters, which
highlights the importance of doing joint fits. The large size of the RAVE
survey, allows us to get precise values for most parameters. However, large
systematic uncertainties remain, especially in $V_{\odot}$ and $\Theta_0$. We
find that, for an extended sample of stars, $\Theta_0$ is underestimated by as
much as $10\%$ if the vertical dependence of the mean azimuthal motion is
neglected. Using a simple model for vertical dependence of kinematics, we find
that it is possible to match the Sgr A* proper motion without any need for
$V_{\odot}$ being larger than that estimated locally by surveys like GCS.

steady unipolar induction in the Kerr black hole magnetosphere filled with a
collisionless plasma screening the electric field (the D field) along the
magnetic field (the B field), i.e., D dot B = 0. We extend the formulations and
arguments made by Komissarov, and generally show that the origin of the
electromotive force is ascribed to the ergosphere. It is explicitly shown that
open magnetic field lines penetrating the ergosphere have a region where the D
field is stronger than the B field in the ergosphere, and it keeps driving the
poloidal currents and generating the electromotive force and the outward
Poynting flux. The range of the possible value of the so-called angular

factor of ${\cal N} = 4$ $U(N+1)$ super Yang--Mills theory, spontaneously
broken to $U(N) \times U(1)$ by being on the Coulomb branch, with the massive
fields integrated out. Thus, it might be the exact effective action (a highly

$SL(2,Z)$ multiplet of BPS soliton solutions of the D3-brane action and show
that in the $N=1$ case they correspond to the electrically charged states that
have been integrated out as well as magnetic monopoles and dyons. Their charges
are uniformly spread on a spherical surface, a soliton bubble, which can be
interpreted as a phase boundary. This picture is consistent with previous
results in the string theory and field theory literature.

scheduling of elastic and inelastic adaptive real-time traffic in fourth
generation Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems. The users are assigned to
resource blocks. A transmission may use multiple resource blocks scheduled over
frequency and time. In our model, we use logarithmic and sigmoidal-like utility
functions to represent the users applications running on different user
equipments (UE)s. We present an optimal problem with utility proportional
fairness policy, where the fairness among users is in utility percentage (i.e
user satisfaction with the service) of the corresponding applications. Our
objective is to allocate the resources to the users with priority given to the
adaptive real-time application users. In addition, a minimum resource
allocation for users with elastic and inelastic traffic should be guaranteed.
Every user subscribing for the mobile service should have a minimum
quality-of-service (QoS) with a priority criterion. We prove that our
scheduling policy exists and achieves the maximum. Therefore the optimal
solution is tractable. We present a centralized scheduling algorithm to
allocate evolved NodeB (eNodeB) resources optimally with a priority criterion.
Finally, we present simulation results for the performance of our scheduling
algorithm and compare our results with conventional proportional fairness
approaches. The results show that the user satisfaction is higher with our

structure factor. Our results show the existence of damped but well-defined
dispersive spin excitations in the whole doping phase diagram. In particular,
the low-energy spin excitations in the superconducting-state have an
hour-glass-shaped dispersion, with commensurate resonance that appears in the
superconducting-state only, while the low-energy incommensurate spin
fluctuations can persist into the normal-state. The high-energy spin
excitations in the superconducting-state on the other hand retain roughly
constant energy as a function of doping, with spectral weights and dispersion
relations comparable to those in the corresponding normal-state. The theory
also shows that the unusual magnetic correlations in cuprate superconductors
can be ascribed purely to the spin self-energy effects which arise directly
from the charge carrier-spin interaction in the kinetic energy of the system.

mechanics. However, it is not rigorously applicable when plastic unloading
appears during crack propagation. One difficulty is that the energy density
with plastic unloading in J integral cannot be defined unambiguously. In this
paper, we alternatively start from the analysis on the power balance, and
propose a surface-forming energy release rate (ERR), which represents the
energy directly dissipated on the surface-forming during the crack propagation
and excludes the loading-mode-dependent plastic dissipation. Therefore the
surface-forming ERR based fracture criterion has wider applicability, including
elastic-plastic crack propagation problems. Several formulae have been derived
for calculating the surface-forming ERR. From the most concise formula, it is
interesting to note that the surface-forming ERR can be computed only by the
stress and deformation of the current moment, and the definition of the energy
density or work density is avoided. When an infinitesimal contour is chosen,
the expression can be further simplified. For any fracture behaviors, the
surface-forming ERR is proven to be path-independent, and the path-independence
of its constituent term, so-called integral, is also investigated. The physical
meanings and applicability of the proposed surface-forming ERR, traditional
ERR, Js integral and J integral are compared and discussed.

The process of gravitational fragmentation in the L1482 molecular

  Methods. We present and compare molecular line emission observations of the
J=2--1 and J=3--2 transitions of 12CO in this molecular complex, using the
KOSMA 3-meter telescope. These observations are complemented with archival data
observations and analyses of the 13CO J=1--0 emission obtained at the Purple
Mountain Observatory 13.7-meter radio telescope at Delingha Station in QingHai
Province of west China, as well as infrared emission maps from the Herschel
Space Telescope online archive, obtained with the SPIRE and PACS cameras.
Comparison of these complementary datasets allow for a comprehensive
multi-wavelength analysis of the L1482 molecular filament.
  Results. We have identified 23 clumps along the molecular filament L1482 in
the California molecular cloud. All these molecular clumps show supersonic
non-thermal gas motions. While surprisingly similar in mass and size to the
much better known Orion molecular cloud, the formation rate of high-mass stars
appears to be suppressed in the California molecular cloud relative to that in
the Orion molecular cloud based on the mass-radius threshold derived from the
static Bonnor Ebert sphere. Our analysis suggests that these molecular
filaments are thermally supercritical and molecular clumps may form by
gravitational fragmentation along the filament. Instead of being static, these
molecular clumps are most likely in processes of dynamic evolution.

constructing the boundary representation (brep) of the volume swept by a given
smooth solid moving along a one parameter family $h$ of rigid motions. Our
extension allows the input solid to have sharp features, i.e., to be of class
G0 wherein, the unit outward normal to the solid may be discontinuous. In the
earlier framework, the solid to be swept was restricted to be G1, and thus this
is a significant and useful extension of that work. This naturally requires a
precise description of the geometry of the surface generated by the sweep of a
sharp edge supported by two intersecting smooth faces. We uncover the geometry
along with the related issues like parametrization, self-intersection and
singularities via a novel mathematical analysis. Correct trimming of such a
surface is achieved by a delicate analysis of the interplay between the cone of
normals at a sharp point and its trajectory under $h$. The overall topology is
explicated by a key lifting theorem which allows us to compute the adjacency
relations amongst entities in the swept volume by relating them to
corresponding adjacencies in the input solid. Moreover, global issues related
to body-check such as orientation are efficiently resolved. Many examples from
a pilot implementation illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our

reionization at z<8 (z<6) through a significant population of faint,
unobserved, galaxies for an assumed escape fraction of 20% (5%). This predicted
population is consistent with extrapolation of the faint end of observed UV
luminosity functions. We find that heating from a global UV/X-ray background

system coupled with anharmonic Jahn-Teller vibration by employing a numerical
renormalization group technique. When a temperature $T$ is decreased, we
encounter a plateau of $\log 3$ entropy due to quasi-triple degeneracy of local
low-energy states, composed of vibronic ground states and the first excited
state with an excitation energy of $\Delta E$. Around at $T$$\approx$$\Delta
E$, we observe an entropy change from $\log 3$ to $\log 2$. This $\log 2$
entropy originates from the rotational degree of freedom of the vibronic state
and it is eventually released due to the screening by orbital moments of
conduction electrons, leading to the Kondo effect of a Jahn-Teller ion. The
Kondo temperature is explained by the effective $s$-$d$ model with anisotropic
exchange interactions.

The pre-collapse magnetic field is strongly amplified by compression in the
infall. Initial fields of the order of 1010 G translate into proto-neutron star
fields similar to the ones observed in pulsars, while stronger initial fields
yield magnetar-like final field strengths. After core bounce, the field is
advected through the hydrodynamically unstable neutrino-heating layer, where
non-radial flows due to convection and the standing accretion shock instability
amplify the field further. Consequently, the resulting amplification factor of
order five is the result of the number of small-eddy turnovers taking place
within the time scale of advection through the post-shock layer. Due to this
limit, most of our models do not reach equipartition between kinetic and
magnetic energy and, consequently, evolve similarly to the non-magnetic case,
exploding after about 800 ms when a single or few high-entropy bubbles persist
over several dynamical time scales. In the model with the strongest initial
field we studied, \$10^{12}\$ G, for which equipartition between flow and field
is achieved, the magnetic tension favours a much earlier development of such
long-lived high-entropy bubbles and enforces a fairly ordered large-scale flow
pattern. Consequently, this model, after exhibiting very regular shock
oscillations, explodes much earlier than non-magnetic ones.

  arXiv:1403.1328",,"10.1093/mnras/stu1708",,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigated the influence of small scale magnetic energy ($E_M$) and
magnetic helicity ($H_M$) on the growth rate ($\gamma$) of large scale magnetic
field ($\overline{{\bf B}}$). $H_M$ that plays a key role in MHD dynamo is a
topological concept describing the structural properties of magnetic fields.
So, it is not possible to differentiate the intrinsic properties of $H_M$ from
the influence of $E_M$, and vice versa. However, to understand MHD dynamo the
features of helical and nonhelical magnetic field should be made clear. For
this, we made a detour: we gave each simulation set its own initial condition
($IC$, same $E_M$(0) and specific $H_M$(0) at $k_f=5$), and then drove the
system with positive helical kinetic energy($k_f=5$). According to the
simulation results, $E_M$(0), whether or not helical, increases the growth rate
of $\overline{{\bf B}}$. The positive $H_M$(0) boosts the increased growth
rate, but the negative $H_M$(0) decreases it. To explain these results two
coupled equations of $H_M$ and $E_M$ were derived and solved using a simple
approximate method. The equations imply that helical magnetic field generates
the whole (helical and nonhelical) magnetic field but quenches itself.
Nonhelical magnetic field also generates the whole magnetic field but quenches
itself. The initially given $E_M$(0) modifies the electromotive force ($\langle
{\bf v}{\bf \times} {\bf b}\rangle$, $EMF$) and generates new terms. The
effects of these terms depend on the magnetic diffusivity $\eta$, position of
initial conditions $k_f$, and time. But the influence disappears as time passes
($\sim e^{-\eta k_f^2 t}$), so the saturated magnetic fields are independent of
the initial conditions.

transition was observed between 1 T and 3 T, with the VL orientation changing
by 45{\deg}. Below 1 T, the VL structure was strongly affected by pinning and
the diffraction pattern had a fourfold symmetry. We suggest that this (and

applications. Its scripts manage and utilize numerical simulations including

processes. It has been suggested that electrons in Bubbles may be accelerated
by shocks produced by tidal disruption of star accreting onto the central black

we show can be efficiently prepared. The quantum speedup is possible because
the performance of the QVA depends on the fanout (number of possible

general much less than $Q$. The QVA constructs a superposition of states which
correspond to all legal paths through the decoding lattice, with phase a

efficient way of scheduling and routing flows on the network, as well as
determining the transmission speed for every flow. We consider two general
versions of the problem. For the version of only flow scheduling where routes
of flows are pre-given, we show that it can be solved polynomially and we
develop an optimal combinatorial algorithm for it. For the version of joint
flow scheduling and routing, we prove that it is strongly NP-hard and cannot
have a Fully Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) unless P=NP. Based on
a relaxation and randomized rounding technique, we provide an efficient
approximation algorithm which can guarantee a provable performance ratio with

uncertainties are then compared with those due to the adoption of different
climate models. We computed stellar evolutionary tracks from the pre-main
sequence phase to the helium flash at the red-giant branch tip for stars with
masses in the range [0.70 - 1.10] Msun, metallicity Z in the range [0.005 -
0.04], and various initial helium contents. We evaluated several
characteristics of the HZ, such as the distance from the host star at which the
habitability is longest, the duration of this habitability, the width of the
zone for which the habitability lasts one half of the maximum, and the
boundaries of the continuously habitable zone (CHZ) for which the habitability
lasts at least 4 Gyr. We developed analytical models, accurate to the percent
level or lower, which allowed to obtain these characteristics in dependence on
the mass and the chemical composition of the host star. The metallicity of the
host star plays a relevant role in determining the HZ. The initial helium
content accounts for a variation of the CHZ boundaries as large as 30% and 10%
in the inner and outer border. The computed analytical models allow the first
systematic study of the variability of the CHZ boundaries that is caused by the
uncertainty in the estimated values of mass and metallicity of the host star.
An uncertainty range of about 30% in the inner boundary and 15% in the outer
one were found. We also verified that these uncertainties are larger than that
due to relying on recently revised climatic models, which leads to a CHZ
boundaries shift within 5% with respect to those of our reference scenario. We
made an on-line tool available that provides both HZ characteristics and
interpolated stellar tracks.

with an entrance membrane window, which is moving periodically and
synchronously with the operation cycle of the spallation source, as explained
in the text below. This proposal profits from the fact that all characteristic
parameters of the problem, such as the pulse duration of the ESS spallation
source, the typical thickness of solid deuterium source that could be easily
realized, the typical time of generation of UCNs in solid deuterium, the length
and diameter of the extraction neutron guide and the time diagram of the
membrane motion that is still realistic, they all fit nicely to optimum desired

that the Milky Way and M31 haloes have lower dimensions and lower stellar
masses than those of other 13 nearby luminous galaxies. However, the

phylogeny model allowing persistent characters, that is characters can be
gained and lost at most once. We define a natural generalization of the P-PP
problem obtained by requiring that for some pairs (character, species), neither
the species nor any of its ancestors can have the character. In other words,
some characters cannot be persistent for some species. This new problem is
called Constrained P-PP (CP-PP).
  Based on a graph formulation of the CP-PP problem, we are able to provide a
polynomial time solution for the CP-PP problem for matrices having an empty

the number of characters. A preliminary experimental analysis of the algorithm
shows that it performs efficiently and it may analyze real haplotype data not

  We study an isothermal system of semi-degenerate self-gravitating fermions in
General Relativity (GR). The most general solutions present mass density
profiles with a central degenerate compact core governed by quantum statistics
followed by an extended plateau, and ending in a power law behaviour $r^{-2}$.
By fixing the fermion mass $m$ in the keV regime, the different solutions
depending on the free parameters of the model: the degeneracy and temperature
parameters at the center, are systematically constructed along the
one-parameter sequences of equilibrium configurations up to the critical point,
which is represented by the maximum in a central density ($\rho_0$) Vs. core
mass ($M_c$) diagram. We show that for fully degenerate cores, the
Oppenheimer-Volkoff (OV) mass limit $M_{c}^{cr}\propto M_{pl}^3/m^2$ is
obtained, while instead for low degenerate cores, the critical core mass
increases showing the temperature effects in a non linear way. The main result
of this work is that when applying this theory to model the distribution of
dark matter in big elliptical galaxies from miliparsec distance-scales up to
$10^2$ Kpc, we do not find any critical core-halo configuration of
self-gravitating fermions, able to explain both the most super-massive dark
object at their center together with the DM halo simultaneously.

singular values, in which a single, univariate nonlinearity is applied to each
of the empirical singular values. We adopt an asymptotic framework, in which
the matrix size is much larger than the rank of the signal matrix to be
recovered, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the low-rank piece stays constant.
For a variety of loss functions, including Mean Square Error (MSE - square
Frobenius norm), the nuclear norm loss and the operator norm loss, we show that
in this framework there is a well-defined asymptotic loss that we evaluate
precisely in each case. In fact, each of the loss functions we study admits a
unique admissible shrinkage nonlinearity dominating all other nonlinearities.
We provide a general method for evaluating these optimal nonlinearities, and
demonstrate our framework by working out simple, explicit formulas for the
optimal nonlinearities in the Frobenius, nuclear and operator norm cases. For
example, for a square low-rank n-by-n matrix observed in white noise with level
$\sigma$, the optimal nonlinearity for MSE loss simply shrinks each data
singular value $y$ to $\sqrt{y^2-4n\sigma^2 }$ (or to 0 if
$y<2\sqrt{n}\sigma$). This optimal nonlinearity guarantees an asymptotic MSE of
$2nr\sigma^2$, which compares favorably with optimally tuned hard thresholding
and optimally tuned soft thresholding, providing guarantees of $3nr\sigma^2$
and $6nr\sigma^2$, respectively. Our general method also allows one to evaluate
optimal shrinkers numerically to arbitrary precision. As an example, we compute

BH wandering in a galactic halo will provide a direct means to investigate in

ISM pressure in the host galaxy that is several orders of magnitude larger than
in quiescent systems. This pressure increase can confine and compress molecular
gas, thus accelerating star formation. In this paper, we model the effects of
increased ambient ISM pressure on spherically symmetric turbulent molecular
clouds. We find that large external pressure confines the cloud and drives a
shockwave into it, which, together with instabilities behind the shock front,
significantly accelerates the fragmentation rate. The compressed clouds
therefore convert a larger fraction of their mass into stars over the cloud
lifetime, and produce clusters that are initially more compact. Neither cloud
rotation nor shear against the ISM affect this result significantly, unless the
shear velocity is higher than the sound speed in the confining ISM. We conclude
that external pressure is an important element in the star formation process,
provided that it dominates over the internal pressure of the cloud.

intracluster medium of the only low redshift galaxy cluster to contain a highly
luminous quasar, H1821+643. The cluster is a highly massive, strong cool core
cluster. We find that the ICM entropy around the quasar is significantly lower
than that of other similarly massive strong cool core clusters within the
central 80 kpc, and that the entropy lies significantly below the extrapolated
baseline entropy profile from hierarchical structure formation. By comparing
the scaled temperature profile with those of other strong cool core clusters of
similar total mass, we see that the entropy deficiency is due to the central
temperature being significantly lower. This suggests that the presence of the
quasar in the core of H1821+643 has had a dramatic cooling effect on the
intracluster medium around it. We find that, if the quasar was brighter in the
past, Compton cooling by radiation from the quasar may have caused the low
entropy and temperature levels in the ICM around the quasar. Curiously, the
gradients of the steep central temperature and entropy decline are in
reasonable agreement with the profiles expected for a constant pressure cooling
flow. It is possible that the system has been locked into a Compton cooled
feedback cycle which prevents energy release from the black hole heating the
gas sufficiently to switch it off, leading to the formation of a huge (~3x10^10

the $N$-particle RS model while a generic top is related to the spin
generalization of the RS model. The simple relation between quantum
$R$-matrices and classical Lax operators is exploited in two ways. In the
elliptic case we use the Belavin's quantum $R$-matrix to describe the
relativistic classical tops. Also by the passage to the noncommutative torus we
study the large $N$ limit corresponding to the relativistic version of the
nonlocal 2d elliptic hydrodynamics. Conversely, in the rational case we obtain
a new ${\rm gl}_N$ quantum rational non-dynamical $R$-matrix via the

of the RS Lax operator and the classical Symplectic Hecke (gauge)
transformation. In particular case of ${\rm gl}_2$ the quantum rational

calculated and found to be in good agreement with experimental data. The
compressibility of Zr and Hf germanates is found to be anisotropic as the
a-axis is less compressible over c-axis due to the presence of Ge-O bonds along
a-axis which is further confirmed from the ordering of the elastic constants
that follows C$_{11}$ $>$ C$_{33}$. The electronic structure of the compounds
has been calculated through recently developed Tran Blaha-modified Becke
Johnson potential. The calculated electronic structure shows that the compounds
are insulators with a gap of 5.39 eV for ZrGeO$_4$ and 6.25 eV for HfGeO$_4$
respectively. Optical anisotropy of these compounds are revealed from the
computed optical properties such as complex dielectric function, refractive
index, and absorption coefficient. In addition, it is observed that Ti doped
ZrGeO$_4$ and HfGeO$_4$ turns out to be a good phosphor as the pristine

that the expected reward at the stopping time is maximum. The approach we
follow, has two main components: the Dynkin's characterization of the value
function as the smallest excessive function dominating the reward; and the
Riesz representation of excessive functions in terms of the Green kernel, the
main reference being Salminen 85. In the context of one-dimensional diffusions
we give a complete characterization of the solution under some assumptions on
the reward function. If the optimal stopping problem is a ray, we provide a
simple equation to find the boundary and discuss the validity of the smooth fit
principle. We include some new examples as the optimal stopping of the skew
Brownian motion and the sticky Brownian motion. In particular, we consider
cases in which the smooth fit principle fails. In the general case, we propose
an algorithm that finds the optimal stopping region when it is a disjoint union
of intervals. We also give a simple formula for the value function. Using this
algorithm we solve some examples including polynomial rewards. For general
Markov processes with continuous sample paths (for instance multidimensional
diffusions) we provide a verification theorem and use it to solve a particular
problem. Finally we consider one-dimensional strong Markov processes with only
positive (or only negative) jumps, and provide another verification theorem for
right-sided (left-sided) problems. As applications of our results we address
the problem of pricing an American put option in a L\'evy market, and also

outer $x_2$ orbits in regions of dense molecular gas subsequently ionized by
the rapidly evolving starburst. The similar radial velocities of the 3 clusters

  Algorithms",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study a cold-start problem in recommendation systems where
we have completely new users entered the systems. There is not any interaction
or feedback of the new users with the systems previoustly, thus no ratings are
available. Trivial approaches are to select ramdom items or the most popular
ones to recommend to the new users. However, these methods perform poorly in
many case. In this research, we provide a new look of this cold-start problem
in recommendation systems. In fact, we cast this cold-start problem as a
contextual-bandit problem. No additional information on new users and new items
is needed. We consider all the past ratings of previous users as contextual
information to be integrated into the recommendation framework. To solve this
type of the cold-start problems, we propose a new efficient method which is
based on the LinUCB algorithm for contextual-bandit problems. The experiments
were conducted on three different publicly-available data sets, namely
Movielens, Netflix and Yahoo!Music. The new proposed methods were also compared
with other state-of-the-art techniques. Experiments showed that our new method
significantly improves upon all these methods.

Current studies consider specific aspects of the above policies, including, for
example, the factors associated with the choice of alternative contraceptive
methods other than sterilization, for women using contraceptives. Although
these analyses produce relevant insights, they fail to provide a global
overview of the different family planning policies, and the determinants

propose a Bayesian semiparametric model relying on a reparameterization of the

sensitivities of our survey, and could have been detected. The non-detection
for all targets then suggests that brown dwarf disks have transitioned to the

surveying single field models and finding that for $r \gtrsim 0.1$ and 8

CMB perturbations and remains sub-Planckian. Models that are sub-Planckian
after 8 e-folds must be patched together with a second epoch of inflation that
fills out the remaining $\sim 50$ e-folds. This second, post-CMB epoch is
characterized by extremely small $\epsilon_V$ and therefore an increasing

incorporating experimental observations into a mathematical model described by
linear partial differential equations (PDEs) to improve the prediction of the
state of a physical system. We augment the linear PDE with a functional that
accounts for the uncertainty in the mathematical model and is modeled as a {\em
Gaussian process}. This gives rise to a stochastic PDE which is characterized
by the Gaussian functional. We develop a {\em functional Gaussian process
regression} method to determine the posterior mean and covariance of the
Gaussian functional, thereby solving the stochastic PDE to obtain the posterior
distribution for our prediction of the physical state. Our method has the
following features which distinguish itself from other regression methods.
First, it incorporates both the mathematical model and the observations into
the regression procedure. Second, it can handle the observations given in the
form of linear functionals of the field variable. Third, the method is
non-parametric in the sense that it provides a systematic way to optimally
determine the prior covariance operator of the Gaussian functional based on the
observations. Fourth, it provides the posterior distribution quantifying the
magnitude of uncertainty in our prediction of the physical state. We present
numerical results to illustrate these features of the method and compare its
performance to that of the standard Gaussian process regression.

reprocessing of X-ray radiation from the material surrounding supermassive
black holes, and it has been found to be omnipresent in the X-ray spectra of
active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this work we study the characteristics of the
narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line in different types of AGN. Using the results of a
large Suzaku study we find that Seyfert 2s have on average lower Fe K$\alpha$
luminosities than Seyfert 1s for the same 10-50 keV continuum luminosity.
Simulating dummy Sy1s and Sy2s populations using physical torus models of X-ray
reflected emission, we find that this difference can be explained by means of
different average inclination angles with respect to the torus, as predicted by
the unified model. Alternative explanations include differences in the
intensities of Compton humps or in the photon index distributions. We show that
the ratio between the flux of the broad and narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line in the
6.35-6.45 keV range depends on the torus geometry considered, and is on average
$<25\%$ and $<15\%$ for type I and type II AGN, respectively. We find evidence
of absorption of the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line flux in Compton-thick AGN, which
suggests that part of the reflecting material is obscured. We estimate that on
average in obscured AGN the reflected radiation from neutral material is seen
through a column density which is 1/4 of that absorbing the primary X-ray
emission. This should be taken into account in synthesis models of the CXB and
when studying the luminosity function of heavily obscured AGN. We detect the
first evidence of the X-ray Baldwin effect in Seyfert 2s, with the same slope
as that found for Seyfert 1s, which suggests that the mechanism responsible for
the decrease of the equivalent width with the continuum luminosity is the same
in the two classes of objects.

approach to quantum mechanics is the origin of the Born rule: why is the
probability given by the square of the amplitude? Following Vaidman, we note
that observers are in a position of self-locating uncertainty during the period
between the branches of the wave function splitting via decoherence and the
observer registering the outcome of the measurement. In this period it is
tempting to regard each branch as equiprobable, but we argue that the
temptation should be resisted. Applying lessons from this analysis, we
demonstrate (using methods similar to those of Zurek's envariance-based
derivation) that the Born rule is the uniquely rational way of apportioning
credence in Everettian quantum mechanics. In doing so, we rely on a single key
principle: changes purely to the environment do not affect the probabilities
one ought to assign to measurement outcomes in a local subsystem. We arrive at
a method for assigning probabilities in cases that involve both classical and
quantum self-locating uncertainty. This method provides unique answers to
quantum Sleeping Beauty problems, as well as a well-defined procedure for
calculating probabilities in quantum cosmological multiverses with multiple
similar observers.

Proceeding in this way, we have evaluated the cross section for the reaction

Luby transform codes. The resulting system, named AONT-LT, is able to improve
the performance by dispersing the data over an arbitrarily large number of
storage nodes while ensuring limited complexity. The proposed solution is
particularly suitable in the case of cooperative storage systems. It is shown
that while the AONT-RS scheme requires the adoption of fragmentation for
achieving widespread distribution, thus penalizing the performance, the new
AONT-LT scheme can exploit variable length codes which allow to achieve very
good performance and scalability.

at zero temperature using the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo technique. The
dipoles are confined on two parallel planes separated by a distance $\lambda$
and are aligned perpendicular to the planes by an external field. The
interlayer pairing, which is responsible for the superfluid behavior of the
system, crosses from a weak to a strong-coupling regime by reducing the
separation distance $\lambda$. For a fixed in-plane density, equal in the two
layers, we calculate the ground-state energy, the chemical potential, the
pairing gap and the quasiparticle dispersion as a function of the interlayer
separation. At large $\lambda$ one recovers the ground-state energy of a single
layer of fermions and at small $\lambda$ the one of a single layer of composite
bosons with twice the particle mass and the dipole moment. The superfluid gap
varies instead from the exponentially small BCS result to half of the large
two-body binding energy in the BEC regime of strong interlayer pairing. Results
are compared with the predictions of the simplest mean-field theory valid in
the low-density limit and deviations are observed both in the BCS regime, where
in-plane repulsions are important, and in the BEC regime where the mean-field
approach fails to describe the physics of composite dipolar bosons.

Integral Ground State method and the fixed-phase approximation. We have
characterized the energy and the local density profile around the vortex axis
in superfluid $^4$He at several densities, ranging from below the equilibrium
density up to the overpressurized regime. For the Onsager-Feynman (OF) phase
our results are exact and represent a benchmark for other theories. The
inclusion of backflow correlations in the phase improves the description of the
vortex with respect to the OF phase by a large reduction of the core energy of
the topological excitation. At all densities the phase with backflow induces a
partial filling of the vortex core and this filling slightly increases with
density. The core size slightly decreases for increasing density and the
density profile has well defined density dependent oscillations whose wave
vector is closer to the wave vector of the main peak in the static density
response function rather than to the roton wave vector. Our results can be
applied to vortex rings of large radius $R$ and we find good agreement with the
experimental value of the energy as function of $R$ without any free parameter.
We have studied also $^4$He above the melting density in the solid phase using
the same functional form for the phase as in the liquid. We found that
off-diagonal properties of the solid are not qualitatively affected by the
velocity field induced by the vortex phase, both with and without backflow
correlations. Therefore we find evidence that a perfect $^4$He crystal is not a
marginally stable quantum solid in which rotation would be able to induce
off-diagonal long-range coherence.

resolved Stellar Nuclei (SNi) in elliptical galaxies centres. Ever growing
observational data indicate the existence of correlations between the
properties of these very dense central star aggregates and those of host
galaxies, which constitute a significant constraint for the validity of
theoretical models of their origin and formation. In the framework of the well
known 'migratory and merger' model for NSC and SN formation, in this paper we
obtain, first, by a simple argument the expected scaling of the NSC/SN mass
with both time and parent galaxy velocity dispersion in the case of dynamical
friction as dominant effect on the globular cluster system evolution. This
generalizes previous results by \cite{TrOsSp} and is in good agreement with
available observational data showing a shallow correlation between NSC/SN mass
and galactic bulge velocity dispersion. Moreover, we give statistical relevance
to predictions of this formation model, obtaining a set of parameters to
correlate with the galactic host parameters. We find that the correlations
between the masses of NSCs in the migratory model and the global properties of
the hosts reproduce quite well the observed correlations, supporting the
validity of the migratory-merger model. In particular, one important result is
the flattening or even decrease of the value of the NSC/SN mass obtained by the
merger model as function of the galaxy mass for high values of the galactic
mass, i.e. $\gtrsim 3\times 10^{11}$M$_\odot$, in agreement with some growing

to calculate energies and density profiles for larger system sizes. We study
the system properties for a wide range of interaction parameters. For the
extreme values of these parameters, different correlation limits can be
identified, where the correlations are either weak or strong. We investigate in
detail how the correlation evolve between the limits. For balanced mixtures in
the number of atoms in each species, the transition between the different
limits involves sophisticated changes in the one- and two-body correlations.
Particularly, we quantify the entanglement between the two components by means
of the von Neumann entropy. We show that the limits equally exist when the
number of atoms is increased, for balanced mixtures. Also, the changes in the
correlations along the transitions among these limits are qualitatively
similar. We also show that, for imbalanced mixtures, the same limits with
similar transitions exist. Finally, for strongly imbalanced systems, only two
limits survive, i.e., a miscible limit and a phase-separated one, resembling
those expected with a mean-field approach.

however, was behaving worse than the trivial one in terms of total complexity
(number of bits sent by all players). He conjectured that achieving total

this conjecture. Namely, we show that for a collapsing protocol for $MPJ_k^n$,
the total communication complexity is at least $n-2$ which closes the gap

freedom available in assigning these gauges is exploited here by defining them
in terms of the configuration, and interactions of the observing system with
the observed one. Impact of the method of observation on its outcome is
described in terms of the assigned gauges so defined and illustrated with
examples. A wavefunction is defined in a simply connected region essentially as
an aggregate of the gauge transformations over all trajectories; equivalently,
an aggregate of the Weyl-lengths acquired by a unit vector transported along
all trajectories from everywhere. This representation is similar to Feynman's
path integral representation differing only in that it incorporates the
assigned gauges yielding an adjusted wavefunction that includes the impact of
an observing system on the observed one. Probability density is shown to be a
uniquely defined gauge invariant quantity but at the expense of the information
about the observable effects contained in the gauge factors, assigned and
otherwise. The particle trajectories defined here are thus shown to provide
additional significant information about a system than provided by the
wavefunction together with the probability density. Present description of the
impact of method of observation on its outcome is compared with the

emission in the central r ~ 2kpc of NGC1068 with spatial resolutions ~

from a r ~ 200pc off-centered circumnuclear disk (CND), from the
2.6kpc-diameter bar region, and from the r ~ 1.3kpc starburst (SB) ring. Most
of the emission in HCO+, HCN and CS stems from the CND. Molecular line ratios
show dramatic order-of-magnitude changes inside the CND that are correlated
with the UV/X-ray illumination by the AGN, betraying ongoing feedback. The gas
kinematics from r ~ 50pc out to r ~ 400pc reveal a massive (M_mol ~ 2.7 (+0.9,
-1.2) x 10^7 Msun) outflow in all molecular tracers. The tight correlation
between the ionized gas outflow, the radio jet and the occurrence of outward
motions in the disk suggests that the outflow is AGN-driven. The outflow rate
estimated in the CND, dM/dt ~ 63 (+21, -37) Msun yr^-1, is an order of
magnitude higher than the star formation rate at these radii, confirming that
the outflow is AGN-driven. The power of the AGN is able to account for the

ability of a team. It is very easy to use, estimating a team's winning
percentage from the runs they score and allow. This data is readily available
on standings pages; no computationally intensive simulations are needed.
Normally accurate to within a few games per season, it allows teams to
determine how much a run is worth in different situations. This determination
helps solve some of the most important economic decisions a team faces: How
much is a player worth, which players should be pursued, and how much should
they be offered. We discuss the formula and these applications in detail, and
provide a theoretical justification, both for the formula as well as simpler
linear estimators of a team's winning percentage. The calculations and modeling
are discussed in detail, and when possible multiple proofs are given. We
analyze the 2012 season in detail, and see that the data for that and other
recent years support our modeling conjectures. We conclude with a discussion of
work in progress to generalize the formula and increase its predictive power
\emph{without} needing expensive simulations, though at the cost of requiring
play-by-play data.

compressive sampling (CS) in a way similar to one-time pad symmetric cipher.
This paper tackles the problem of constructing a CS-based symmetric cipher
under the key reuse circumstance, i.e., the cipher is resistant to common
attacks even a fixed measurement matrix is used multiple times. To this end, we
suggest a bi-level protected CS (BLP-CS) model which makes use of the advantage
of the non-RIP measurement matrix construction. Specifically, two kinds of
artificial basis mismatch techniques are investigated to construct key-related
sparsifying bases. It is demonstrated that the encoding process of BLP-CS is
simply a random linear projection, which is the same as the basic CS model.
However, decoding the linear measurements requires knowledge of both the
key-dependent sensing matrix and its sparsifying basis. The proposed model is
exemplified by sampling images as a joint data acquisition and protection layer
for resource-limited wireless sensors. Simulation results and numerical
analyses have justified that the new model can be applied in circumstances
where the measurement matrix can be re-used.

the emergence of income profiles out of a whole of individual economic

differential equations which involve parameters defined by probabilities.
Society is described as an ensemble of individuals divided into income classes;
the individuals exchange money through binary and ternary interactions, leaving
the total wealth unchanged. The ternary interactions represent taxation and
redistribution effects. Dynamics is investigated through computational
simulations, the focus being on the effects that different fiscal policies and
differently weighted welfare policies have on the long-run income
distributions. The model provides a tool which may contribute to the
identification of the most effective actions towards a reduction of economic
inequality. We find for instance that, under certain hypotheses, the Gini index
is more affected by a policy of reduction of the welfare and subsidies for the
rich classes than by an increase of the upper tax rate. Such a policy also has
the effect of slightly increasing the total tax revenue.

with classical solutions of the Dirac equation testify in favor of the
unidenticality of masses, energies, and momenta of neutrinos of the different

accepting its ideas about that the left-handed neutrino and the right-handed
antineutrino refer to long-lived leptons, and the right-handed neutrino and the
left-handed antineutrino are short-lived fermions, we would follow the
mathematical logic of the Dirac equation in the presence of the flavor
symmetrical mass, energy, and momentum matrices. From their point of view,
nature itself separates Minkowski space into left and right spaces concerning a
certain middle dynamical line. Thereby, it characterizes any Dirac particle
both by left and by right space-time coordinates. It is not excluded therefore
that whatever the main purposes each of earlier experiments about sterile
neutrinos, namely, about right-handed short-lived neutrinos may serve as the
source of facts confirming the existence of a mirror Minkowski space-time.
