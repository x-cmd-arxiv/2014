satellites. Examples include Ganymede's grooved terrain, Europa's gray bands,
Miranda's coronae, and several terrains on Enceladus. The conditions associated
with the formation of each of these terrains are similar: heat flows of order
tens to a hundred milliwatts per meter squared, and deformation rates of order
$10^{-16}$ to $10^{-12}$ s$^{-1}$. Our prior work shows that the conditions
associated with the formation of these terrains on Ganymede and the south pole
of Enceladus are consistent with vigorous solid-state ice convection in a shell
with a weak surface. We show that sluggish lid convection, an intermediate
regime between the isoviscous and stagnant lid regimes, can create the heat
flow and deformation rates appropriate for ridge and trough formation on a
number of satellites, regardless of the ice shell thickness. For convection to
deform their surfaces, the ice shells must have yield stresses similar in
magnitude to the daily tidal stresses. Tidal and convective stresses deform the
surface, and the spatial pattern of tidal cracking controls the locations of
ridge-and-trough terrain.

by the combined effects of electrostatic forces, gravity and surface tension.
The free boundary in our system develops sharp corners/singularities in certain
parameter regimes, and this is an impediment to using existing ""single-scale""
numerical conformal mapping methods. The difficulty is due to the phenomenon of
crowding, i.e. the tendency of nodes in the preimage plane to concentrate near
the sharp regions of the boundary, leaving the smooth regions of the boundary
poorly resolved. A natural idea is to exploit the scale separation between the
sharp regions and smooth regions to solve for each region separately, and then
stitch the solutions together. However, this is not straightforward as
conformal maps are rigid ""global"" objects, and it is not obvious how one would
patch two conformal maps together to obtain a new conformal map. We develop a
""multi-scale"" (i.e. adaptive) conformal mapping method that allows us to carry
out this program of stitching conformal maps on different scales together. We
successfully apply our method to the electromechanical model problem and
discuss how it generalizes to other situations.

  two-way coupling regime","Submitted to Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 56 pages, 15 figures",,,,"nlin.CD physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Particulate flows have been largely studied under the simplifying assumptions
of one-way coupling regime where the disperse phase do not react-back on the
carrier fluid. In the context of turbulent flows, many non trivial phenomena
such as small scales particles clustering or preferential spatial accumulation
have been explained and understood. A more complete view of multiphase flows
can be gained calling into play two-way coupling effects, i.e. by accounting
for the inter-phase momentum exchange between the carrier and the suspended
phase, certainly relevant at increasing mass loading. In such regime, partially
investigated in the past by the so-called Particle In Cell (PIC) method, much
is still to be learned about the dynamics of the disperse phase and the ensuing
alteration of the carrier flow.
  In this paper we present a new methodology rigorously designed to capture the
inter-phase momentum exchange for particles smaller than the smallest
hydrodynamical scale, e.g. the Kolmogorov scale in a turbulent flow. In fact,
the momentum coupling mechanism exploits the unsteady Stokes flow around a
small rigid sphere where the transient disturbance produced by each particle is
evaluated in a closed form. The particles are described as lumped, point masses
which would lead to the appearance of singularities. A rigorous regularization
procedure is conceived to extract the physically relevant interactions between
particles and fluid which avoids any ""ah hoc"" assumption. The approach is
suited for high efficiency implementation on massively parallel machines since
the transient disturbance produced by the particles is strongly localized in
space around the actual particle position. As will be shown, hundred thousands
particles can therefore be handled at an affordable computational cost as
demonstrated by a preliminary application to a particle laden turbulent shear
flow.

axiomatization of categories of differentiable functions. The fundamental
example is the category whose objects are Euclidean spaces and whose arrows are
smooth maps.
  Tensor differential categories provide the framework for categorical models
of differential linear logic. The coKleisli category of any tensor differential
category is always a Cartesian differential category. Cartesian differential
categories, besides arising in this manner as coKleisli categories, occur in
many different and quite independent ways. Thus, it was not obvious how to pass
from Cartesian differential categories back to tensor differential categories.
  This paper provides natural conditions under which the linear maps of a
Cartesian differential category form a tensor differential category. This is a
question of some practical importance as much of the machinery of modern
differential geometry is based on models which implicitly allow such a passage,
and thus the results and tools of the area tend to freely assume access to this
structure.
  The purpose of this paper is to make precise the connection between the two
types of differential categories. As a prelude to this, however, it is
convenient to have available a general theory which relates the behaviour of
""linear"" maps in Cartesian categories to the structure of Seely categories. The
latter were developed to provide the categorical semantics for (fragments of)
linear logic which use a ""storage"" modality. The general theory of storage,
which underlies the results mentioned above, is developed in the opening
sections of the paper and is then applied to the case of differential
categories.

However, the model tuning process can be streamlined by adaptively resampling
candidate values so that settings that are clearly sub-optimal can be
discarded. The notion of futility analysis is introduced in this context. An
example is shown that illustrates how adaptive resampling can be used to reduce
training time. Simulation studies are used to understand how the potential

frequency of 700Hz (approximately the largest known rotation rate of neutron
stars), the deviations are generally small. Nevertheless, for a very stiff
equation of state and a high mass the deviation of one of the epicyclic
frequencies from its GR value is appreciable even at a spin frequency of 700Hz.
In principle, such a deviation could become important in models of
quasi-periodic oscillations in low-mass x-ray binaries and could serve as a
test of strong gravity (if other parameters are well constraint). Even though
the present paper is concentrated mainly on orbital and epicyclic frequencies,

type of Landau-Zener transitions where the population transfer is mediated by
interaction rather than from a direct diabatic coupling. For this scenario, at
a mean-field level the dynamics is greatly influenced by quantum interferences.
In particular, regardless of how slow the Landau-Zener sweep is, for certain
parameters almost no population transfer occurs, which is in stark contrast to
the regular Landau-Zener model. For moderate system sizes, this
counterintuitive mean-field behaviour is not duplicated in the quantum case.
This can be attributed quantum fluctuations and the fact that multi-level

continuous variables. Our scheme is based on the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill
encoding scheme whereby a qubit is embedded in the infinite-dimensional space
of a quantum harmonic oscillator. The novel application of discrete-variable
device-independent quantum key distribution to this encoding enables a
continuous-variable analogue. Since the security of this protocol is based on
discrete-variables we inherit by default security against collective attacks
and, under certain memoryless assumptions, coherent attacks. We find that our
protocol is valid over the same distances as its discrete-variable counterpart,
except that we are able to take advantage of high efficiency commercially
available detectors where, for the most part, only homodyne detection is
required. This offers the potential of removing the difficulty in closing the
loopholes associated with Bell inequalities.

telescope at the Observat\'orio Pico dos Dias (LNA - Brazil) equipped with a
CCD camera and Johnson/Cousins BVRI filters, and the SOPHIE \'echelle
spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence (CNRS - France). The light
curve of V354 Mon shows periodical minima (P = 5.26 +/- 0.50 days) that vary in
depth and width at each rotational cycle. From the analysis of the photometric
and spectroscopic data, it is possible to identify correlations between the
emission line variability and the light-curve modulation of the young system,
such as the occurrence of pronounced redshifted absorption in the H_alpha line
at the epoch of minimum flux. This is evidence that during photometric minima
we see the accretion funnel projected onto the stellar photosphere in our line
of sight, implying that the hot spot coincides with the light-curve minima. We
applied models of cold and hot spots and a model of occultation by
circumstellar material to investigate the source of the observed photometric
variations. We conclude that nonuniformly distributed material in the inner
part of the circumstellar disk is the main cause of the photometric modulation,
which does not exclude the presence of hot and cold spots at the stellar
surface. It is believed that the distortion in the inner part of the disk is
created by the dynamical interaction between the stellar magnetosphere,
inclined with respect to the rotation axis, and the circumstellar disk, as also
observed in the classical T Tauri star AA Tau and predicted by
magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulations.

the treatment of bound charges, which add crucial, dynamical components to the
dielectric constant that are neglected in the conventional hydrodynamic model,
especially in the visible and UV ranges, where interband transitions are
important. The model attempts to inject into the classical electrodynamic

incorporating a thin patina of free-electrons that screens an internal,

show that bulk CDW order exists at least for hole concentrations (p) in the
CuO2 planes of 0.078 <~ p <~ 0.132. This implies that CDW order exists in close
vicinity to the quantum critical point for spin density wave (SDW) order. In
contrast to the pseudogap temperature T*, the onset temperature of CDW order
decreases with underdoping to T_CDW ~ 90K in YBa2Cu3O6.44. Together with a
weakened order parameter this suggests a competition between CDW and SDW
orders. In addition, the CDW order in YBa2Cu3O6.44 shows the same type of
competition with superconductivity as a function of temperature and magnetic
field as samples closer to p = 1/8. At low p the CDW incommensurability
continues the previously reported linear increasing trend with underdoping. In
the entire doping range the in-plane correlation length of the CDW order in
b-axis direction depends only very weakly on the hole concentration, and
appears independent of the type and correlation length of the oxygen-chain
order. The onset temperature of the CDW order is remarkably close to a
temperature T^\dagger that marks the maximum of 1/(T_1T) in planar 63^Cu
NQR/NMR experiments, potentially indicating a response of the spin dynamics to
the formation of the CDW. Our discussion of these findings includes a detailed

defined by inversion of $F$. Indeed the estimate is more accurate and it
involves the Levi form of $M$ and of additional weights, instead of $\Box_b$.
Next a general tangential estimate, ""twisted"" by a pseudodifferential operator
$\Psi$ is established. The combination of the two yields a general
""$f$-estimate"" twisted by $\Psi$. We apply the twisted estimate for $\Psi$
which is the composition of a cut-off $\eta$ with a differentiation of order
$s$ such as $R^s$ of Section 4. Under the assumption that $[\partial_b,\eta]$
and $[\partial_b,[\bar\partial_b,\eta]]$ are superlogarithmic multipliers in a
sense inspired to Kohn, we get the local regularity of the Green operator
$G=\Box_b^{-1}$. In particular, if $M$ has ""infraexponential type"" along
$S\setminus\Gamma$ where $S$ is a manifold of CR dimension $0$ and $\Gamma$ a
curve transversal to $T^{\mathbb C} M$, then we have local regularity of $G$.
This gives an immediate proof of former work by Baracco, Khanh, Zampieri and by

composed by a cut off $\eta$ and a differentiation of order $s$ such as
$\Lambda^s$ or $R^s$ and $M$ is a decoupled hypersurface which has
infraexponential type along the coordinate lines $\mathbb

is one of the contributions to the three-point functions of Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) maps in harmonic space. We show that the CIB-lensing
bispectrum has a considerable strength and that it can be detected with high
significance in the Planck high-frequency maps. We also present forecasts of
the contamination on different shapes of the primordial non-Gaussianity
$f_{nl}$ parameter produced by the CIB-lensing bispectrum and by the
extragalactic point sources bispectrum in the Planck high-resolution CMB
anisotropy maps. The local, equilateral and orthogonal shapes are considered
for 'raw' single-frequency (i.e., without applying any component separation
technique) and foreground-reduced Planck temperature maps. The CIB-lensing
correlation seems to mainly affect orthogonal shapes of the bispectrum - with
{\Delta}$f_{nl}$ = -21 and -88 for the 143 and 217 GHz bands respectively -
while point sources mostly impact equilateral shapes, with {\Delta}$f_{nl}$ =
160, 54 and 60 at 100, 143 and 217 GHz. However, the results indicate that
these contaminants do not induce any relevant bias on Planck $f_{nl}$ estimates
when foreground-reduced maps are considered: using SEVEM for the component
separation we obtain {\Delta}$f_{nl}$ = 10.5 due to the CIB-lensing and
{\Delta}$f_{nl}$ = 30.4 due to point sources, corresponding to 0.30{\sigma} and
0.45{\sigma} in terms of the Planck 2013 $f_{nl}$ uncertainty. The component
separation technique is, in fact, able to partially clean the extragalactic
source contamination and the bias is reduced for all the shapes. We have
further developed single- and multiple-frequency estimators based on the
Komatsu, Spergel & Wandelt (2005) formalism that can be implemented to
efficiently detect this signal.

a 'progressive fitting method' that determines global average SFRD($z$) and

at which the SFRD($z$) peaks is higher than the $z$ above which $A_\nu(z)$
begins to decline. For each case, we compute the EBL from ultra-violet to the
far-infrared and optical depth ($\tau_\gamma$) encountered by the high energy
$\gamma$-rays due to pair production upon collisions with these EBL photons. We
compare these with measurements of the local EBL, $\gamma$-ray horizon and

z=1.5. In the local universe a tight steep relationship has been stablished
between these two quantities (L_X,gas~ L_K^4.5) suggesting the presence of
largely virialized halos in X-ray luminous systems. We use well established
relations from the study of local universe ETGs, together with the expected
evolution of the X-ray emission, to subtract the contribution of low mass X-ray
binary populations (LMXBs) from the X-ray luminosity of our sample. Our
selection minimizes the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN), yielding a
sample representative of normal passive COSMOS ETGs; therefore the resulting
luminosity should be representative of gaseous halos, although we cannot
exclude other sources such as obscured AGN, or enhanced X-ray emission
connected with embedded star formation in the higher z galaxies. We find that
most of the galaxies with estimated L_X<10^42 erg/s and z<0.55 follow the
L_X,gas- L_K relation of local universe ETGs. For these galaxies, the
gravitational mass can be estimated with a certain degree of confidence from
the local virial relation. However, the more luminous (10^42<L_X<10^43.5 erg/s)
and distant galaxies present significantly larger scatter; these galaxies also
tend to have younger stellar ages. The divergence from the local L_X,gas - L_K
relation in these galaxies implies significantly enhanced X-ray emission, up to
a factor of 100 larger than predicted from the local relation. We discuss the
implications of this result for the presence of hidden AGN, and the evolution
of hot halos, in the presence of nuclear and star formation feedback.

specifically, we divide the transverse momentum and the total invariant mass
spectra into two bins and use the differential rates in each bin to constrain
the magnitude of the aforementioned effects. Significantly improved results
could be obtained over those using total cross section alone. However, some
degeneracy remains, especially in the determination of the Higgs trilinear

explore the role of box size and resolution on the result. The shock front
curves toward the stellar surface, and exhibits a kink from which weak

enriched in $\alpha$-elements compared to iron by at least 0.2 dex relative to

stellar binaries. To clarify their origin one has to understand the dynamics of
planetesimals in protoplanetary disks within binaries. The standard
description, accounting for only gas drag and gravity of the companion star has
been challenged recently, as the gravity of the protoplanetary disk was shown
to play a crucial role in planetesimal dynamics. An added complication is the
tendency of protoplanetary disks in binaries to become eccentric, giving rise
to additional excitation of planetesimal eccentricity. Here, for the first
time, we analytically explore secular dynamics of planetesimals in binaries
such as $\alpha$ Cen and $\gamma$ Cep under the combined action of (1) gravity
of the eccentric protoplanetary disk, (2) perturbations due to the (coplanar)
eccentric companion, and (3) gas drag. We derive explicit solutions for the
behavior of planetesimal eccentricity ${\bf e}_p$ in non-precessing disks (and
in precessing disks in certain limits). We obtain the analytical form of the
distribution of relative velocities of planetesimals, which is a key input for
understanding their collisional evolution. Disk gravity strongly influences
relative velocities and tends to push sizes of planetesimals colliding with
comparable objects at the highest speed to small values, $\sim 1$ km. We also
find that planetesimals in eccentric protoplanetary disks apsidally aligned
with the binary orbit collide at lower relative velocities than in mis-aligned
disks. Our results highlight a decisive role that disk gravity plays in
planetesimal dynamics in binaries.

contradicts unperturbed debris ring models, suggesting the presence of an

analytical and biological chemistry, pharmacology, and fundamental physics.
Recent developments have extended optical chiral sensing using microwaves, fs
pulses, superchiral light, and photoionization. The most widely used methods
are the traditional methods of circular dichroism and optical rotation (OR).
However, chiral signals are typically very weak, and their measurement is
limited by larger time-dependent backgrounds and by imperfect and slow
subtraction procedures. Here, we demonstrate a pulsed-laser
bowtie-cavity-enhanced polarimeter with counter-propagating beams, which solves
these background problems: the chiral signals are enhanced by the number of
cavity passes; the effects of linear birefringence are suppressed by a large
induced intracavity Faraday rotation; and rapid signal reversals are effected
by reversing the Faraday rotation and subtracting signals from the
counter-propagating beams. These advantages allow measurements of absolute
chiral signals in environments where background subtractions are not feasible:
we measure optical rotation from chiral vapour in open air, and from chiral
liquids in the evanescent wave (EW) produced by total internal reflection at a
prism surface. EW-OR of (+)-maltodextrin and (-)-fructose solutions confirm the
Drude-Condon model for Maxwell's equations in isotropic optically active media.
In particular, the effective optical rotation path length, near index matching,
is equal to the Goos-H\""anchen shift of the EW. The limits of this polarimeter,
when using a continuous-wave laser locked to a stable high-finesse cavity,
should match sensitivity measurements for linear birefringence ($3\times
10^{-13}$ rad), which is several orders of magnitude more sensitive than
current chiral detection limits, transforming the power of chiral sensing in
many fields.

compact, self-calibrating E-field probe (sensor). This approach is based on the
interaction of radio frequency (RF) fields with alkali atoms excited to Rydberg
states. The RF field causes an energy splitting of the Rydberg states via the
Autler-Townes effect and we detect the splitting via electromagnetically
induced transparency (EIT). In effect, alkali atoms placed in a vapor cell act
like an RF-to-optical transducer, converting an RF E-field strength measurement
to an optical frequency measurement. We demonstrate the broadband nature of
this approach by showing that one small vapor cell can be used to measure
E-field strengths over a wide range of frequencies: 1 GHz to 500 GHz. The
technique is validated by comparing experimental data to both numerical
simulations and far-field calculations for various frequencies. We also discuss
various applications, including: a direct traceable measurement, the ability to
measure both weak and strong field strengths, compact form factors of the
probe, and sub-wavelength imaging and field mapping.

data from Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph at the Gemini North telescope and
archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey images. The data were obtained in two
different positions across the galaxy, obtaining a total 4 arcsec X 8 arcsec
field which encompasses most of its ISM. Emission-line maps and broad-band
images obtained in this study indicate that HS 2236+1344 hosts three Giant HII
regions. Our data also reveal some faint curved features in the BCD periphery
that might be due to tidal perturbations or expanding ionized-gas shells. The
ISM velocity field shows systematic gradients along the major axis of the BCD,
with its south-eastern and north-western half differing by ~80 km/s in their
recessional velocity. The Ha and Hb equivalent width distribution in the
central part of HS 2236+1344 is consistent with a very young (~3 Myr) burst.
Our surface photometry analysis indicates that the ongoing starburst provides
~50% of the total optical emission, similar to other BCDs. It also reveals an
underlying lower-surface brightness component with moderately red colors, which
suggest that the galaxy has undergone previous star formation. We derive an
integrated oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H)=7.53\pm0.06 and a nitrogen-to-oxygen

coupling constant for the $t-$channel is proportional to the SDW order and
involves interactions that do not contribute to superconductivity outside of

general different than $0$ or $\pi$, manifesting explicitly the breaking of the
time-reversal symmetry promoted by long-range SDW order. We show that this
exotic state emerges already in the simplest model of Fe-pnictides, with one
hole pocketand two symmetry-related electron pockets. We argue that in some
parameter range time-reversal gets broken even before long-range

analyze the stability of stationary states in a diverge-merge network. Finally
we present an example to show that LTM is not well-defined with non-invariant

exists on one side of the bifurcation. A simple eigenvalue condition indicates
whether the fixed points exist on different sides of the bifurcation (this case
can be interpreted as the persistence of a single fixed point), or on the same
side of the bifurcation (in which case the bifurcation is akin to a saddle-node
bifurcation). A similar eigenvalue condition indicates whether or not there
exists a period-two solution on one side of the bifurcation. Previously these
conditions have been combined to obtain five distinct scenarios for the

  Our algorithms run in polynomial time, and in some cases even match the
optimal non-private running time (as measured by oracle complexity). We give
separate algorithms (and lower bounds) for $(\epsilon,0)$- and
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy; perhaps surprisingly, the techniques
used for designing optimal algorithms in the two cases are completely
different.
  Our lower bounds apply even to very simple, smooth function families, such as
linear and quadratic functions. This implies that algorithms from previous work
can be used to obtain optimal error rates, under the additional assumption that
the contributions of each data point to the loss function is smooth. We show
that simple approaches to smoothing arbitrary loss functions (in order to apply
previous techniques) do not yield optimal error rates. In particular, optimal

argue that both free- and confined- cell migration may be described by a

previously proposed to solve a completely separate problem in collective cell
migration. Our model can be mapped to a diffusive escape over a barrier and
analytically solved to determine the cell's orientation distribution and
repolarization rate. In quasi-one-dimensional confinement, velocity-aligning
cells maintain their direction for times that can be exponentially larger than
their persistence time in the absence of confinement. Our results suggest an
important new connection between single- and collective- cell migration: high
persistence in confined cells corresponds with fast alignment of velocity to

behavioral and neuronal correlates of experience. However, correlates are not
enough if we are to understand even basic neurological fact; nor are they of
much help in cases where we would like to know if consciousness is present:
patients with a few remaining islands of functioning cortex, pre-term infants,
non-mammalian species, and machines that are rapidly outperforming people at
driving, recognizing faces and objects, and answering difficult questions. To
address these issues, we need a theory of consciousness that specifies what
experience is and what type of physical systems can have it. Integrated
Information Theory (IIT) does so by starting from conscious experience via five
phenomenological axioms of existence, composition, information, integration,
and exclusion. From these it derives five postulates about the properties
required of physical mechanisms to support consciousness. The theory provides a
principled account of both the quantity and the quality of an individual
experience, and a calculus to evaluate whether or not a particular system of
mechanisms is conscious and of what. IIT explains a range of clinical and
laboratory findings, makes testable predictions, and extrapolates to unusual
conditions. The theory vindicates some panpsychist intuitions - consciousness
is an intrinsic, fundamental property, is graded, is common among biological
organisms, and even some very simple systems have some. However, unlike
panpsychism, IIT implies that not everything is conscious, for example group of
individuals or feed forward networks. In sharp contrast with widespread
functionalist beliefs, IIT implies that digital computers, even if their
behavior were to be functionally equivalent to ours, and even if they were to
run faithful simulations of the human brain, would experience next to nothing.

difficult. Quantitative Fitness Analysis (QFA) is a high-throughput
experimental and computational methodology for quantifying the fitness of
microbial cultures. QFA can be used to compare between fitness observations for
different genotypes and thereby infer genetic interaction strengths. Current
""naive"" frequentist statistical approaches used in QFA do not model
between-genotype variation or difference in genotype variation under different
conditions. In this thesis, a Bayesian approach is introduced to evaluate
hierarchical models that better reflect the structure or design of QFA
experiments. First, a two-stage approach is presented: a hierarchical logistic
model is fitted to microbial culture growth curves and then a hierarchical
interaction model is fitted to fitness summaries inferred for each genotype.
Next, a one-stage Bayesian approach is presented: a joint hierarchical model
which does not require a univariate summary of fitness, used to pass
information between models. The new hierarchical approaches are then compared
using a dataset examining the effect of telomere defects on yeast. By better
describing the experimental structure, new evidence is found for genes and
complexes which interact with the telomere cap. Various extensions of these
models, including models for data transformation, batch effects, and
intrinsically stochastic growth models are also considered.

behavior on social networks. An individual's threshold indicates the minimum
level of influence that must be exerted, by other members of the population
engaged in some activity, before the individual will join the activity. In this
work, we begin with a homogeneous version of the Linear Threshold model
proposed by Kempe et al. in the context of viral marketing, and generalize this
model to arbitrary threshold distributions. We show that the evolution can be
modeled as a discrete time Markov chain, and, by using a certain scaling, we
obtain a fluid limit that provides an ordinary differential equation model
(o.d.e.). We find that the threshold distribution appears in the o.d.e. via its
hazard rate function. We demonstrate the accuracy of the o.d.e. approximation
and derive explicit expressions for the trajectory of influence under the
uniform threshold distribution. Also, for an exponentially distributed
threshold, we show that the fluid dynamics are equivalent to the well-known SIR
model in epidemiology. We also numerically study how other hazard functions
(obtained from the Weibull and loglogistic distributions) provide qualitative
different characteristics of the influence evolution, compared to traditional
epidemic models, even in a homogeneous setting. We finally show how the model
can be extended to a setting with multiple communities and conclude with
possible future directions.

powered via the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism or the annihilation of
neutrinos and anti-neutrinos from a neutrino cooling-dominated accretion flow
(NDAF). The advection and diffusion of the large-scale magnetic field of a NDAF
is calculated, and the external magnetic field is found to be dragged inward
efficiently by the accretion flow for a typical magnetic Prandtl number P_m=1.
The maximal BZ jet power can be ~10^53-10^54 erg/sec for an extreme Kerr black
hole, if an external magnetic field with 10^14 Gauss is advected by the NDAF.
This is roughly consistent with the field strength of the disk formed after a
tidal disrupted magnetar. The accretion flow near the black hole horizon is
arrested by the magnetic field if the accretion rate is below than a critical
value for a given external field. The arrested accretion flow fails to drag the
field inward and the field strength decays, and then the accretion re-starts,
which leads to oscillating accretion. The typical timescale of such episodic
accretion is in an order of one second. This can qualitatively explain the
observed oscillation in the soft extend emission of short-type GRBs.

around the remnant. One of the partial shells, about 5' extending beyond the
northeastern border of the remnant's bright radio shell, seems to just confine
the faint radio halo. On the other hand, some faint CO clumps can be discerned
along the eastern boundary of the faint remnant's radio halo. Connecting the
eastern CO clumps, the northeastern partial shell structures, and the northern
CO partial shell, we can see that a half molecular ring structure appears to
surround the remnant. The LSR velocity of the half-ring structure is in the
range of -5 km/s to -2 km/s, which is consistent with that of the -4 km/s
molecular clouds. We suggest that the half-ring structure of the CO emission at
V_LSR -4 km/s is associated with the SNR. The structures are possibly swept up
by the stellar winds of SNR IC 443's massive progenitor. Based on the

in accordance with previous experimental results on InSb nanowire.
Interestingly, due to the exotic property of Majorana fermion, there exists a
hole transmission channel which makes the currents asymmetric at the left and
right leads. The \textit{ac} current response mediated by Majorana fermion is
also studied here. To discuss the impacts of Coulomb interaction and disorder
on the transport property of Majorana nanowire, we use the renormalization
group method to study the phase diagram of the wire. It is found that there is
a topological phase transition under the interplay of superconductivity and
disorder. We find that the Majorana transport is preserved in the
superconducting-dominated topological phase and destroyed in the
disorder-dominated non-topological insulator phase.

analysing multi-epoch stellar spectra from SDSS and LAMOST for radial velocity
(RV) variations. We employ a Bayesian method to infer the maximum likelihood of
the fraction of binary stars with orbital periods of 1000 days or shorter,
assuming a simple model distribution for a binary population with circular
orbits. The overall inferred fraction of stars with such a close binary
companion is 43.0% \pm 2.0% for a sample of F, G, K stars from SDSS SEGUE, and
30% \pm 8.0% in a similar sample from LAMOST. The apparent close binary
fraction decreases with the stellar effective temperature. We divide the SEGUE
and LEGUE data into three subsamples with different metallicity ([Fe/H] < -1.1;
-1.1 < [Fe/H] < -0.6; -0.6 < [Fe/H]), for which the inferred close binary
fractions are 56% \pm 5.0%, 56.0% \pm 3%, and 30% \pm 5.7%. The metal-rich
stars from our sample are therefore substantially less likely to possess a
close binary companion than otherwise similar stars drawn from metal-poor
populations. The different ages and formation environments of the Milky Way's
thin disk, thick disk and halo may contribute to explaining these observations.
Alternatively metallicity may have a significant effect on the formation and/or
evolution of binary stars.

  arXiv:1207.2231",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the present paper we consider the problem of Laplace deconvolution with
noisy discrete non-equally spaced observations on a finite time interval. We
propose a new method for Laplace deconvolution which is based on expansions of
the convolution kernel, the unknown function and the observed signal over
Laguerre functions basis (which acts as a surrogate eigenfunction basis of the
Laplace convolution operator) using regression setting. The expansion results
in a small system of linear equations with the matrix of the system being
triangular and Toeplitz. Due to this triangular structure, there is a common
number $m$ of terms in the function expansions to control, which is realized
via complexity penalty. The advantage of this methodology is that it leads to
very fast computations, produces no boundary effects due to extension at zero
and cut-off at $T$ and provides an estimator with the risk within a logarithmic
factor of the oracle risk. We emphasize that, in the present paper, we consider
the true observational model with possibly nonequispaced observations which are
available on a finite interval of length $T$ which appears in many different
contexts, and account for the bias associated with this model (which is not
present when $T\rightarrow\infty$). The study is motivated by perfusion imaging
using a short injection of contrast agent, a procedure which is applied for
medical assessment of micro-circulation within tissues such as cancerous
tumors. Presence of a tuning parameter $a$ allows to choose the most
advantageous time units, so that both the kernel and the unknown right hand
side of the equation are well represented for the deconvolution. The
methodology is illustrated by an extensive simulation study and a real data
example which confirms that the proposed technique is fast, efficient,
accurate, usable from a practical point of view and very competitive.

$x\in \mathbb{R}^n$, we study the query complexity of randomized algorithms for
estimating the trace of the matrix. This problem has many applications in
quantum physics, machine learning, and pattern matching. Two metrics are
commonly used for evaluating the estimators: i) variance; ii) a high
probability multiplicative-approximation guarantee. Almost all the known
estimators are of the form $\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^k x_i^T A x_i$ for $x_i\in
\mathbb{R}^n$ being i.i.d. for some special distribution.
  Our main results are summarized as follows. We give an exact characterization
of the minimum variance unbiased estimator in the broad class of linear
nonadaptive estimators (which subsumes all the existing known estimators). We
also consider the query complexity lower bounds for any (possibly nonlinear and
adaptive) estimators: (1) We show that any estimator requires
$\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ queries to have a guarantee of variance at most
$\epsilon$. (2) We show that any estimator requires
$\Omega(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\log \frac{1}{\delta})$ queries to achieve a
$(1\pm\epsilon)$-multiplicative approximation guarantee with probability at
least $1 - \delta$. Both above lower bounds are asymptotically tight.
  As a corollary, we also resolve a conjecture in the seminal work of Avron and
Toledo (Journal of the ACM 2011) regarding the sample complexity of the
Gaussian Estimator.

velocity statistics. However, measuring the volume weighted velocity statistics
from inhomogeneously distributed galaxies (simulation particles/halos) suffer
from an inevitable and significant sampling artifact. We study this sampling
artifact in the velocity power spectrum measured by the nearest-particle (NP)
velocity assignment method(Zheng et al. 2013, PRD). We derive the analytical
expression of leading and higher order terms. We find that the sampling
artifact suppresses the $z=0$ E-mode velocity power spectrum by $\sim 10\%$ at
$k=0.1h/$Mpc , for samples with number density $10^{-3}({\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$.
This suppression becomes larger for larger $k$ and for sparser samples. We
argue that, this source of systematic errors in peculiar velocity cosmology,
albeit severe, can be self-calibrated in the framework of our theoretical
modelling. We also work out the sampling artifact in the density-velocity cross
power spectrum measurement. More robust evaluation of related statistics
through simulations will be presented in a companion paper (Zheng, Zhang &
Jing, 2015, PRD). We also argue that similar sampling artifact exists in other
velocity assignment methods and hence must be carefully corrected to avoid
systematic bias in peculiar velocity cosmology.

star-edge nodes, near-cliques or nodes that act as bridges to different regions
of the graph. Intuitively, two nodes belong to the same role if they are
structurally similar. Roles have been mainly of interest to sociologists, but
more recently, roles have become increasingly useful in other domains.
Traditionally, the notion of roles were defined based on graph equivalences
such as structural, regular, and stochastic equivalences. We briefly revisit
these early notions and instead propose a more general formulation of roles
based on the similarity of a feature representation (in contrast to the graph
representation). This leads us to propose a taxonomy of three general classes
of techniques for discovering roles that includes (i) graph-based roles, (ii)
feature-based roles, and (iii) hybrid roles. We also propose a flexible
framework for discovering roles using the notion of similarity on a
feature-based representation. The framework consists of two fundamental
components: (a) role feature construction and (b) role assignment using the
learned feature representation. We discuss the different possibilities for
discovering feature-based roles and the tradeoffs of the many techniques for
computing them. Finally, we discuss potential applications and future
directions and challenges.

is a periodic variable in X-rays with a period of $208 \pm 3$ days. X-ray light
curves in the 0.5-10.0 keV energy band show phase-locked variability, where the
flux increased by a factor of ~2 from minimum to maximum, being maximum near
periastron passage. The light curve in the soft energy band (0.5-2.0 keV) shows
two minima indicating the presence of two eclipses. However, the light curve in
the hard energy band (2.0-10.0 keV) shows only one minimum during the apastron
passage. The X-ray spectra of WR 25 were explained by a two-temperature plasma
model. Both the cool and the hot plasmas were constant at 0.628+/-0.008 and
2.75+/-0.06 keV throughout an orbital cycle, where the cooler plasma could be
due to the small scale shocks in a radiation-driven outflow and the high
temperature plasma could be due to the collision of winds. The column density
varied with the orbital phase and was found to be maximum after the periastron
passage, when the WN star is in front of the O star. The abundances of WR 25
were found to be non-solar. Optical V-band data of WR 25 also show the
phase-locked variability, being at maximum near periastron passage. The results
based on the present analysis indicate that WR 25 is a colliding wind binary
where the presence of soft X-rays is attributed to individual components;
however, hard X-rays are due to the collision of winds.

introductory textbooks. It is known that this theory can be formulated as an
action principle and expanded to include thermodynamicics. This paper presents
an action principle for hydrodynamics that includes general, rotational flows.
  The new theory is a combination of Eulerian and Lagrangian hydrodynamics,
with an extension to thermodynamics that includes all the elements of the
Gibbsean variational principle. In the first place it is an action principle
for adiabatic systems, including the usual conservation laws. Viscosity can be
introduced in the usual way, by adding a dissipative term to the momentum
equation. The equation for energy dissipation then follows. It is an ideal
framework for the description of quasi-static processes, including dissipation.
It is a major development of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier approach, the principal
advantage being a hamiltonian structure with a natural concept of energy in the
form of a first integral of the motion, conserved by virtue of the
Euler-Lagrange equations.

actively query and manipulate a network's internal state. We show how this
""tiny packet program"" (TPP) interface gives end-hosts unprecedented visibility
into network behavior, enabling them to work with the network to achieve a
common goal. Our design leverages what each component does best: (a) switches
forward and execute tiny packet programs (at most 5 instructions) at line rate,
and (b) end-hosts perform arbitrary computation on network state, which are
easy to evolve. Using a hardware prototype on a NetFPGA, we show our design is
feasible, at a reasonable cost. By implementing three different research
proposals, we show that TPPs are also useful. And finally, we present an
architecture in which they can be made secure.

experience the same path-loss, (2) even with AN generation secure transmission
may not be possible if the number of eavesdropper antennas is too large and not

the GUT scale, it is not possible to have light neutralinos leading to the
decay channel $H\rightarrow \tilde{\chi}_1^0 \tilde{\chi}_1^0$. The invisible
decay mode is allowed in case of certain $SO(10)$ and $E_6$ grand unified
models with large representations and nonuniversal gaugino masses at the GUT
scale. In case of the NMSSM, for the parameter space considered it is possible
to have the invisible decay channel with universal gaugino masses at the GUT

independent parameters for both MSSM and NMSSM. We isolate the regions in
parameter space in both cases, where the second lightest Higgs boson has a mass
of 126 GeV and then concentrate on the invisible decay of Higgs to lighter

measurements. It is found that motion of DWs can be driven by a current density
as low as 1.44$\times$10$^{11}$ A.m$^{-2}$. The effect of the Oersted field

non-adiabatic factor $\beta$ up to 0.4.

model that fits the observed data remarkably well at metallicities between 1/10

that they can have a considerable effect on the measured electron temperature,

ionization parameter values give better fits at higher oxygen abundance. We
show that higher pressures combined with low optical depth, and also kappa
electron energy distributions at low kappa values, can generate the apparent
high electron temperatures in low metallicity HII regions, and that the former
provides the better fit to observations. We examine the effects of these

  Spectrum Access","This manuscript is the complete technical report for the journal
  version published in INFORMS Operations Research",,,,"cs.NI cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic spectrum access is a new paradigm of secondary spectrum utilization
and sharing. It allows unlicensed secondary users (SUs) to exploit
opportunistically the under-utilized licensed spectrum. Market mechanism is a
widely-used promising means to regulate the consuming behaviours of users and,
hence, achieves the efficient allocation and consumption of limited resources.
In this paper, we propose and study a hybrid secondary spectrum market
consisting of both the futures market and the spot market, in which SUs
(buyers) purchase under-utilized licensed spectrum from a spectrum regulator,
either through predefined contracts via the futures market, or through spot
transactions via the spot market. We focus on the optimal spectrum allocation
among SUs in an exogenous hybrid market that maximizes the secondary spectrum
utilization efficiency. The problem is challenging due to the stochasticity and
asymmetry of network information. To solve this problem, we first derive an
off-line optimal allocation policy that maximizes the ex-ante expected spectrum
utilization efficiency based on the stochastic distribution of network
information. We then propose an on-line VickreyCClarkeCGroves (VCG) auction
that determines the real-time allocation and pricing of every spectrum based on
the realized network information and the pre-derived off-line policy. We
further show that with the spatial frequency reuse, the proposed VCG auction is
NP-hard; hence, it is not suitable for on-line implementation, especially in a
large-scale market. To this end, we propose a heuristics approach based on an
on-line VCG-like mechanism with polynomial-time complexity, and further
characterize the corresponding performance loss bound analytically. We finally
provide extensive numerical results to evaluate the performance of the proposed
solutions.

investigated theoretically. The NEST is caused by different parts of the cavity
being at distinct temperatures or by temperature gradients. By using a rate
equation based on the Lindblad equation, we derive an analytic expression for
the steady-state distribution of the photon spectrum. We predict differences
between the non-equilibrium steady state and a fit to the black-body spectrum
calculated via Planck's law with an effective temperature. For two bodies of
similar size at two temperatures which differ by a factor of two, the
difference would be more than 10%. We also show that cavity resonances have a
particularly large influence on the resulting non-equilibrium steady state of
the photons. The investigation of thermal spectra in the presence of more than
one temperature can be important for high-precision atomic clocks.

  Formation of bubbles irreversibly changes the surface quality of irradiated

efficiency of that technology depends on the thermo-optical properties of the
sail materials. Therefore, bubble formation processes have to be taken into
account for the planning of long-term solar sail missions.

favours the Starobinsky and Higgs inflation scenarios. Assuming that the BICEP2

prefers instead the $\phi^2$ chaotic models. The constraint we get from Planck

template to understand, manage and mitigate future impacts. Although the event
has been documented in great detail, the actual pre-impact orbit of the parent

Monte Carlo approach that includes the coordinates of the impact point to
compute the most probable solution for the pre-impact orbit (a = 1.62 au, e =
0.53, i = 3.97 degrees, \Omega; = 326.45 and \omega; = 109.71). We also check
all the published solutions using a simple yet robust statistical test to show
that many of them have problems to cause an impact at the right time. We use
the improved orbit and N-body simulations to revisit the dynamical status of a
putative Chelyabinsk asteroid family and confirm that it could be linked to
resonant asteroids 2007 BD7 and 2011 EO40. In addition, and as the
classification of Chelyabinsk meteorites is well established, a search for
meteorite falls of the same chondrite group and petrologic type gives some
evidence for the existence of an associated LL5 chondrite cluster.

solving gas-dynamical problems. It has been applied to simulate the evolution

accuracy, with a resolution that is usually much higher in the compressed

check a scheme to balance and equalize the resolution of SPH between high- and

quality by varying only a single parameter (the exponent of the Sinc function).
The scheme is checked and validated through a number of numerical tests, from
standard one-dimensional Riemann problems in shock tubes, to multidimensional
simulations of explosions, hydrodynamic instabilities and the collapse of a
sun-like polytrope. The analysis of the hydrodynamical simulations suggests
that the scheme devised to equalizing accuracy improves the treatment of the
post-shock regions and, in general, of the rarefacted zones of fluids while
causing no harm to the growth of hydrodynamic instabilities. The method is
robust and easy to implement with a low computational overload. It conserves
mass, energy, and momentum and reduces to the standard SPH scheme in regions of
the fluid that have smooth density gradients.

used three chiral fields when we investigated open and closed universes. To
prove the validity of the EmU scenario we fixed the scale factor and found the
exact solution by decomposition of EGB equations and solving the chiral field
dynamics equation. To this end, we suggested the decomposition of the EGB
equations in such a way that the first chiral field is responsible for the
Einstein part of the model, while the second field, together with kinetic
interaction term, is connected with the Gauss--Bonnet part of the theory. We
proved that both fields are phantom ones under this decomposition, and that the
model has a solution if the kinetic interaction between the fields equals a
constant. We have presented the exact solution in terms of cosmic time. This
was done for a spatially flat universe. In the case of open and closed
universes we introduced the third chiral field (canonical for closed and
phantom for open universe) which is responsible for the EGB and curvature
parts. The solution of the third field equation is obtained in quadratures.
Thus we have proved that the CCM is able to support EmU scenario in EGB gravity

for two isolated photons, with transverse energy above 40 and 25 GeV

attention in the theoretical literature. The progress in experimental
realisations of this fascinating physics however has been much slower. While
materials with a ladder-like structure exist, one always has coupling between
the ladders to muddy the waters. In addition, such materials exhibit limited
(if any) tunability in terms of the magnetic exchange parameters, and
experimental probing of the different phases is a great challenge. In this
work, we show that a realisation of spin-ladder physics can occur in an
engineered nanostructure made out of bilayer graphene in the zero-filling
quantum Hall state. Specifically, we describe a split-double-gated setup in
which a domain wall is explicitly induced in the middle of the sample, and show
that an effective spin-ladder forms along this domain wall. The interaction
strengths of the ladder are tunable by adjusting magnetic and electric fields
as well as the spacing between the gates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
effective spin ladder has a helical nature, meaning that the spin-correlations
may be probed rather simply with charge transport experiments. We describe the
phase diagram of this system, and show that certain transport measurements are
very sensitive to the phase.

survey data with known survey variances. Our proposed methodology is motivated
by the American Community Survey (ACS), an ongoing survey administered by the
U.S. Census Bureau that provides timely information on several key demographic
variables. Specifically, the ACS produces 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year
""period-estimates,"" and corresponding margins of errors, for published
demographic and socio-economic variables recorded over predefined geographies
within the United States. Despite the availability of these predefined
geographies it is often of interest to data users to specify customized
user-defined spatial supports. In particular, it is useful to estimate
demographic variables defined on ""new"" spatial supports in ""real-time."" This
problem is known as spatial change of support (COS), which is typically
performed under the assumption that the data follows a Gaussian distribution.
However, count-valued survey data is naturally non-Gaussian and, hence, we
consider modeling these data using a Poisson distribution. Additionally,
survey-data are often accompanied by estimates of error, which we incorporate
into our analysis. We interpret Poisson count-valued data in small areas as an
aggregation of events from a spatial point process. This approach provides us
with the flexibility necessary to allow ACS users to consider a variety of
spatial supports in ""real-time."" We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach through a simulated example as well as through an analysis using
public-use ACS data.

compute threshold selection for image segmentation. ABC is a heuristic
algorithm motivated by the intelligent behavior of honey-bees which has been
successfully employed to solve complex optimization problems. In this approach,
an image 1D histogram is approximated through a Gaussian mixture model whose
parameters are calculated by the ABC algorithm. For the approximation scheme,
each Gaussian function represents a pixel class and therefore a threshold.
Unlike the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, the ABC based method shows
fast convergence and low sensitivity to initial conditions. Remarkably, it also
improves complex time consuming computations commonly required by
gradient-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithms ability
to perform automatic multi threshold selection yet showing interesting
advantages by comparison to other well known algorithms.

condensation in the vacuum state, the symmetry of parity is spontaneously
broken. As a consequence, fermionic quasi-particles propagating in the
condensate can be identified and are seen to possess a confining dynamical

remove approximately the longest simple path from a network iteratively until

augmenting approach (RPA) and the Hamilton-path based approach (HPA), for
finding the approximately longest simple path in a network. Results demonstrate
that steps of longest-path attacks increase with network density linearly for
random networks, while exponentially increasing for scale-free networks. The
more homogeneous the degree distribution is, the more fragile the network,
which is totally different from the previous results of node or edge attacks.
HPA is generally more efficient than RPA in the longest-path attacks of complex
networks. These findings further help us understand the vulnerability of
complex systems, better protect complex systems, and design more tolerant
complex systems.

triple resonance three dimensional NMR experiments involving amide 1H and 15N
resonances. However for intrinsically unstructured proteins, alpha-helical
proteins or proteins containing several disordered fragments, the assignment
becomes problematic because of high degree of backbone shift degeneracy. In
this backdrop, a novel reduced dimensionality (RD) experiment
-(5,3)D-hNCO-CANH- is presented to facilitate (and/or to validate) the
sequential backbone resonance assignment in such proteins. The proposed 3D NMR
experiment makes use of the modulated amide 15N chemical shifts (resulting from
the joint sampling along both its indirect dimensions) to resolve the ambiguity
involved in connecting the neighboring amide resonances (i.e. HiNi and
Hi-1Ni-1) for overlapping amide NH peaks. The experiment -encoding 5D spectral
information- leads to a conventional 3D spectrum with significantly reduced
spectral crowding and complexity. The improvisation is based on the fact that
the linear combinations of intra-residue and inter-residue backbone chemical
shifts along both the co-evolved indirect dimensions span a wider spectral
range and produce better peak dispersion than the individual shifts themselves.
Taken together, the experiment -in combination with routine triple resonance 3D
NMR experiments involving backbone amide (1H and 15N) and carbon (13C-alpha and
13C') chemical shifts- will serve as a powerful complementary tool to achieve
the nearly complete assignment of protein backbone resonances in a time
efficient manner. The performance of the experiment and application of the
method have been demonstrated here using a 15.4 kDa size folded protein and a
12 kDa size unfolded protein.

line-of-sight of a transmitter-receiver pair. To date, modeling this decrease
in received signal strength and utilizing it for localization purposes have
received a considerable amount of attention in the research field. However,
when the person is in the close vicinity of the line-of-sight but not

this paper, we first model the effect of human-induced reflections as a
function of communication frequency, and then use the model as a basis for
energy based occupancy detection. The derived methods are evaluated numerically
and the detection probability of the proposed detector is validated with

done by the external process compensates for this learning rate. The third
model is more complete, also containing adaptation. For this model we show
inter alia that a bacterium in an environment that changes at a very slow

the concept of a coarse-grained learning rate, we show for the model with
adaptation that while the activity learns about the external signal the option
of changing the methylation level increases the concentration range for which
the learning rate is substantial.

investigate different explanations for this phenomenon and favor an
interpretation based on secular perturbations in multi-planet systems on
non-resonant orbits. In those systems, the orbital eccentricity of the
innermost planet can reach values close to unity through a process of chaotic
diffusion of its orbital elements in the phase space. When the eccentricity of
the innermost orbit becomes so high that the periastron gets closer than about
0.05 AU, tides shrink and circularize the orbit producing a close-in planet on
a timescale shorter than about 50 Myr. The probability of high eccentricity
excitation and subsequent circularization is estimated and is found to increase
with the age of the system. Thus, we are able to explain the observed
statistical correlation between stellar rotation and minimum orbital period of
the innermost planet by using the stellar rotation period as a proxy of its age
through gyrochronology. Moreover, our model is consistent with the entire
observed distributions of the rotation and orbital periods for orbital periods

  Communications",,,,,"cs.NI cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Energy harvesting from the surroundings is a promising solution to
perpetually power-up wireless sensor communications. This paper presents a
data-driven approach of finding optimal transmission policies for a
solar-powered sensor node that attempts to maximize net bit rates by adapting
its transmission parameters, power levels and modulation types, to the changes
of channel fading and battery recharge. We formulate this problem as a
discounted Markov decision process (MDP) framework, whereby the energy
harvesting process is stochastically quantized into several representative
solar states with distinct energy arrivals and is totally driven by historical
data records at a sensor node. With the observed solar irradiance at each time
epoch, a mixed strategy is developed to compute the belief information of the
underlying solar states for the choice of transmission parameters. In addition,
a theoretical analysis is conducted for a simple on-off policy, in which a
predetermined transmission parameter is utilized whenever a sensor node is
active. We prove that such an optimal policy has a threshold structure with
respect to battery states and evaluate the performance of an energy harvesting
node by analyzing the expected net bit rate. The design framework is
exemplified with real solar data records, and the results are useful in
characterizing the interplay that occurs between energy harvesting and
expenditure under various system configurations. Computer simulations show that
the proposed policies significantly outperform other schemes with or without
the knowledge of short-term energy harvesting and channel fading patterns.

(OSNs). Gathering diffusion data over these large networks encounters many
challenges which can be alleviated by adopting a suitable sampling approach.
The contributions of this paper is twofold. First we study the sampling
approaches over diffusion networks, and for the first time, classify these
approaches into two categories; (1) Structure-based Sampling (SBS), and (2)
Diffusion-based Sampling (DBS). The dependency of the former approach to
topological features of the network, and unavailability of real diffusion paths
in the latter, converts the problem of choosing an appropriate sampling
approach to a trade-off. Second, we formally define the diffusion network
sampling problem and propose a number of new diffusion-based characteristics to
evaluate introduced sampling approaches. Our experiments on large scale
synthetic and real datasets show that although DBS performs much better than
SBS in higher sampling rates (16% ~ 29% on average), their performances differ
about 7% in lower sampling rates. Therefore, in real large scale systems with
low sampling rate requirements, SBS would be a better choice according to its
lower time complexity in gathering data compared to DBS. Moreover, we show that
the introduced sampling approaches (SBS and DBS) play a more important role
than the graph exploration techniques such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and
Random Walk (RW) in the analysis of diffusion processes.

  It is well known that matroid algebras have a well defined notion of

at least two elements. Denote by $\End(\A)$ the monoid of endomorphisms of

some variants of the monoid of linear operators of a finite-dimensional vector

partial transformations on $X$, the monoid of endomorphisms of a free $G$-set

observed that each of these definitions is of one of two types: algebraic
definitions, in which composites and coherence cells are explicitly specified,
and non-algebraic definitions, in which a coherent choice of composites and
constraint cells is merely required to exist. Relatively few comparisons have
been made between definitions, and most of those that have concern the
relationship between definitions of just one type. The aim of this thesis is to
establish more comparisons, including a comparison between an algebraic
definition and a non-algebraic definition.
  The thesis is divided into two parts. Part 1 concerns the relationships
between three algebraic definitions of weak n-category: those of Penon and
Batanin, and Leinster's variant of Batanin's definition. A correspondence
between the structures used to define composition and coherence in the
definitions of Batanin and Leinster has long been suspected; we make this
precise for the first time. We use this correspondence to prove several
coherence theorems that apply to all three definitions, and to take the first
steps towards describing the relationship between the weak n-categories of
Batanin and Leinster.
  In Part 2 we take the first step towards a comparison between Penon's
definition of weak n-category and a non-algebraic definition, Simpson's variant
of Tamsamani's definition, in the form of a nerve construction. As a prototype
for this nerve construction, we recall a nerve construction for bicategories
proposed by Leinster, and prove that the nerve of a bicategory given by this
construction is a Tamsamani--Simpson weak 2-category. We then define our nerve
functor for Penon weak n-categories. We prove that the nerve of a Penon weak
2-category is a Tamsamani--Simpson weak 2-category, and conjecture that this
result holds for higher n.

storage resources, while data-parallel systems exploit the resources available
in the cloud to perform parallel transformations over large amounts of data. In
the same line, considerable emphasis has been recently given to two apparently
disjoint research topics: data-parallel, and eventually consistent, distributed
systems. Declarative networking has been recently proposed to ease the task of
programming in the cloud, by allowing the programmer to express only the
desired result and leave the implementation details to the responsibility of
the run-time system. In this context, we propose a study on a
logic-programming-based computational model for eventually consistent,
data-parallel systems, the keystone of which is provided by the recent finding
that the class of programs that can be computed in an eventually consistent,
coordination-free way is that of monotonic programs. This principle is called
CALM and has been proven by Ameloot et al. for distributed, asynchronous
settings. We advocate that CALM should be employed as a basic theoretical tool
also for data-parallel systems, wherein computation usually proceeds
synchronously in rounds and where communication is assumed to be reliable. It
is general opinion that coordination-freedom can be seen as a major
discriminant factor. In this work we make the case that the current form of
CALM does not hold in general for data-parallel systems, and show how, using
novel techniques, the satisfiability of the CALM principle can still be
obtained although just for the subclass of programs called connected monotonic
queries. We complete the study with considerations on the relationships between
our model and the one employed by Ameloot et al., showing that our techniques
subsume the latter when the synchronization constraints imposed on the system
are loosened.

parameters via isochrone fitting. We have identified a large population of
luminous supergiants confirmed as cluster members via radial velocity
measurements. We find nine red supergiants (plus one other candidate) and two
yellow supergiants. We also identify a large population of OB stars. Ten of
them are bright enough to be blue supergiants. The cluster lies behind 7.5 mag
of extinction for the preferred value of Rv of 2.9. Isochrone fitting allows
for a narrow range of ages between 12 and 16 Ma. The cluster radial velocity is
compatible with distances of 6 and 10 kpc. The shorter distance is inconsistent
with the age range and Galactic structure. The longer distance implies an age
of 12 Ma and a location not far from the position where some Galactic models
place the far end of the Galactic Bar. VdBH 222 is a young massive cluster with
a likely mass greater than 20000 Msolar . Its population of massive evolved
stars is comparable to that of large associations, such as Per OB1. Its
location in the inner Galaxy, presumably close to the end of the Galactic bar,

scheme dependent and thus unphysical. However, in the presence of additional
symmetries, the partition function of even-dimensional CFTs can become

partition function exists and computes the Kahler potential on the chiral and
twisted chiral superconformal manifolds. We provide a new elementary proof of
this result using Ward identities on the sphere. The Kahler transformation

of the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Using only those four bandpowers, we carry out a
complete analysis in the cosmological and inflationary slow-roll parameter
space using the BICEP2 polarization measurements alone and extract the Bayesian
evidences and complexities for all the Encyclopaedia Inflationaris models. This
allows us to determine the most probable and simplest BICEP2 inflationary
scenarios. Although this list contains the simplest monomial potentials, it
also includes many other scenarios, suggesting that focusing model building
efforts on large field models only is unjustified at this stage. We demonstrate
that the sets of inflationary models preferred by Planck alone and BICEP2 alone
are almost disjoint, indicating a clear tension between the two data sets. We
address this tension with a Bayesian measure of compatibility between BICEP2
and Planck. We find that for models favored by Planck the two data sets tend to
be incompatible, whereas there is a moderate evidence of compatibility for the
BICEP2 preferred models. As a result, it would be premature to draw any
conclusion on the best Planck models, such as Starobinsky and/or Kahler moduli
inflation. For the subset of scenarios not exhibiting data sets
incompatibility, we update the evidences and complexities using both data sets
together.

environment whose conditions may be considered as ""extreme"" in the entire Solar
System. Both solar wind and radiation are stronger with respect to other Solar
System bodies, so that their interactions with the planet cause high emission
of material from its surface. Moreover, the meteoritic precipitation plays a
significant role in surface emission processes. This emitted material is
partially lost in space. Although under the present conditions the surface
particles loss rate does not seem to be able to produce significant erosion of
the planetary mass and volume, the long-term effects over billions of years
should be carefully considered to properly understand the evolution of the
planet. In the early stages, under even more extreme conditions, some of these
processes were much more effective in removing material from the planet's
surface. This study attempts to provide a rough estimation of the material loss
rate as a function of time, in order to evaluate whether and how this
environmental effect can be applied to understand the Hermean surface
evolution. We show that the most potentially effective Sun-induced erosion
process in early times is a combination of ion sputtering, photon stimulated
desorption and enhanced diffusion, which could have caused the loss of a
surface layer down to a depth of 20 m, as well as a relevant Na depletion.

TOF-MS, NEMS-MS can still measure masses. This demonstrates the possibility to
measure mass spectra for neutral particles. Thus, it is possible to envisage
MS-based studies of analytes that are incompatible with current ionization
techniques and the way is now open for the development of cutting edge system
architectures with unique analytical capability.

compute threshold selection for image segmentation as it is a critical
preprocessing step for image analysis, pattern recognition and computer vision.
LA is a heuristic method which is able to solve complex optimization problems
with interesting results in parameter estimation. Despite other techniques
commonly seek through the parameter map, LA explores in the probability space
providing appropriate convergence properties and robustness. The segmentation
task is therefore considered as an optimization problem and the LA is used to
generate the image multi-threshold separation. In this approach, one 1D
histogram of a given image is approximated through a Gaussian mixture model
whose parameters are calculated using the LA algorithm. Each Gaussian function
approximating the histogram represents a pixel class and therefore a threshold
point. The method shows fast convergence avoiding the typical sensitivity to
initial conditions such as the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm or the
complex time-consuming computations commonly found in gradient methods.
Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm ability to perform automatic
multi-threshold selection and show interesting advantages as it is compared to
other algorithms solving the same task.

two types of heterogeneities in the grains' C isotopic compositions: smooth,
radial gradients in $^{12}C/^{13}C$, with this ratio trending toward solar with
increasing radius; and highly anomalous pockets up to 2 {\mu}m in size with
$^{12}C/^{13}C$ > solar that are located near the centers of the grain

heterogeneities. These grains and their constituent parts probably formed in a
