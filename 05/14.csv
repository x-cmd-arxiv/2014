  methods",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the short time behaviour of stochastic systems affected by a
stochastic volatility evolving at a faster time scale. We study the asymptotics
of a logarithmic functional of the process by methods of the theory of
homogenisation and singular perturbations for fully nonlinear PDEs. We point
out three regimes depending on how fast the volatility oscillates relative to
the horizon length. We prove a large deviation principle for each regime and
apply it to the asymptotics of option prices near maturity.

garnered significant interest in recent years. A central tenet of this problem
is relational learning. Here the objective is to incorporate the partial
information each data source gives us in a way that captures the true
underlying relationships. To address this challenge, we present a general,
boosting-inspired framework for combining weak evidence of entity associations
into a robust similarity metric. Building on previous work, we explore the
extent to which different local quality measurements yield graph
representations that are suitable for community detection. We present empirical
results on a variety of datasets demonstrating the utility of this framework,
especially with respect to real datasets where noise and scale present serious
challenges. Finally, we prove a convergence theorem in an ideal setting and
outline future research into other application domains.

Inequalities characterize the correlation polytope, whereas when the
communication direction is bi-directional, 143 inequalities describe the

local mathematics is described. Emphasis is placed on the effects of scaling on
coordinate systems. Effects of scaling are represented by a scalar field,
$\theta,$ that appears in gauge theories as a spin zero boson. Gauge theory
considerations led to the concept of local mathematics, as expressed through
the use of universes, as collections of local mathematical systems at each
point, x, of a space time manifold, M. Both local and global coordinate charts
are described. These map M into either local or global coordinate systems
within a universe or between universes, respectively. The lifting of global
expressions of nonlocal physical quantities, expressed by space and or time
integrals or derivatives on M, to integrals or derivatives on coordinate
systems, is described. The assumption of local mathematics and universes makes
integrals and derivatives, on M or on global charts, meaningless. They acquire
meaning only when mapped into a local universe. The effect of scaling, by
including the effect of $\theta$ into the local maps, is described. The lack of
experimental evidence for $\theta$ so far shows that the coupling constant of
$\theta$ to matter fields must be very small compared to the fine structure
constant. Also the gradient of $\theta$ must be very small in the local region
of cosmological space and time occupied by us as observers. So far, there are
no known restrictions on $\theta$ or its gradient in regions of space and/or
time that are far away from our local region.

frameworks in order to compute the probability of queries in a time that
depends on the size of the domains of the random variables rather than the
number of instances. Even if various authors have underlined its importance for
probabilistic logic programming (PLP), lifted inference has been applied up to
now only to relational languages outside of logic programming. In this paper we
adapt Generalized Counting First Order Variable Elimination (GC-FOVE) to the
problem of computing the probability of queries to probabilistic logic programs
under the distribution semantics. In particular, we extend the Prolog Factor
Language (PFL) to include two new types of factors that are needed for
representing ProbLog programs. These factors take into account the existing
causal independence relationships among random variables and are managed by the
extension to variable elimination proposed by Zhang and Poole for dealing with
convergent variables and heterogeneous factors. Two new operators are added to
GC-FOVE for treating heterogeneous factors. The resulting algorithm, called
LP$^2$ for Lifted Probabilistic Logic Programming, has been implemented by
modifying the PFL implementation of GC-FOVE and tested on three benchmarks for
lifted inference. A comparison with PITA and ProbLog2 shows the potential of
the approach.

number of species can lead to stochasticity in gene expression across identical
cells. As a result, after induction of gene expression, the time at which a
specific protein count is reached is stochastic as well. Therefore events
taking place at a critical protein level will see stochasticity in their
timing. First-passage time (FPT), the time at which a stochastic process hits a
critical threshold, provides a framework to model such events. Here, we
investigate stochasticity in FPT. Particularly, we consider events for which
controlling stochasticity is advantageous. As a possible regulatory mechanism,
we also investigate effect of auto-regulation, where the transcription rate of
gene depends on protein count, on stochasticity of FPT. Specifically, we
investigate for an optimal auto-regulation which minimizes stochasticity in
FPT, given fixed mean FPT and threshold.
  For this purpose, we model the gene expression at a single cell level. We
find analytic formulas for statistical moments of the FPT in terms of model
parameters. Moreover, we examine the gene expression model with
auto-regulation. Interestingly, our results show that the stochasticity in FPT,
for a fixed mean, is minimized when the transcription rate is independent of
protein count. Further, we discuss the results in context of lysis time of an
\textit{E. coli} cell infected by a $\lambda$ phage virus. An optimal lysis
time provides evolutionary advantage to the $\lambda$ phage, suggesting a
possible regulation to minimize its stochasticity. Our results indicate that
there is no auto-regulation of the protein responsible for lysis. Moreover,
congruent to experimental evidences, our analysis predicts that the expression
of the lysis protein should have a small burst size.

this tension could be relieved since the oscillation of photons to ALPs would
mitigate the effects of EBL absorption and lead to softer inferred intrinsic
AGN spectra. In this paper we consider the effect of photon-ALP mixing on
observed spectra, including the photon-ALP mixing that would occur within AGN
jets. We then simulate observations of three AGN with the Cherenkov Telescope

for detecting the signatures of photon-ALP mixing on the spectra. We conclude
that prospects for CTA detecting these signatures or else setting limits on the

domain decomposition technique to handle the decomposition of domain into
subdomains. Two different methods of enforcing compatibility along the
subdomain interface will be used in the time discrete setting. A systematic
theoretical analysis (which includes numerical stability, influence of
perturbations, bounds on drift along the subdomain interface) will be
performed. The first coupling method ensures that there is no drift along the
subdomain interface but does not facilitate explicit/implicit coupling. The
second coupling method allows explicit/implicit coupling with controlled (but
non-zero) drift in the solution along the subdomain interface. Several
canonical problems will be solved to numerically verify the theoretical
predictions, and to illustrate the overall performance of the proposed coupling
methods. Finally, we shall illustrate the robustness of the proposed coupling
methods using a multi-time-step transient simulation of a fast bimolecular

that seen by XMM-Newton and Chandra below 10 keV. At high energies NuSTAR
clearly detects non-thermal emission up to ~20 keV that extends along the
eastern and northern rim of the supernova shell. The broadband images clearly
demonstrate that X-ray emission from the North Spur and Eastern Limb results
predominantly from non-thermal processes. We detect a break in the spatially
integrated X-ray spectrum at ~9 keV that cannot be reproduced by current SED
models, implying either a more complex electron injection spectrum or an
additional process such as diffusion compared to what has been considered in
previous work. We use spatially resolved maps to derive an energy-dependent
cooling length scale, $L(E) \propto E^{m}$ with $m = -0.21 \pm 0.01$. We find
this to be inconsistent with the model for the morphological evolution with
energy described by Kennel & Coroniti (1984). This value, along with the
observed steepening in power-law index between radio and X-ray, can be
quantitatively explained as an energy-loss spectral break in the simple scaling
model of Reynolds (2009), assuming particle advection dominates over diffusion.
This interpretation requires a substantial departure from spherical

to quantify the association between groups of genes and a clinical phenotype.
In many cases, however, a gene set-based interpretation of genomic data is
desired in the absence of a phenotype variable. Although methods exist for
unsupervised gene set testing, they predominantly compute enrichment relative
to clusters of the genomic variables with performance strongly dependent on the
clustering algorithm and number of clusters. Results: We propose a novel
method, spectral gene set enrichment (SGSE), for unsupervised competitive
testing of the association between gene sets and empirical data sources. SGSE
first computes the statistical association between gene sets and principal
components (PCs) using our principal component gene set enrichment (PCGSE)
method. The overall statistical association between each gene set and the
spectral structure of the data is then computed by combining the PC-level
p-values using the weighted Z-method with weights set to the PC variance scaled
by Tracey-Widom test p-values. Using simulated data, we show that the SGSE
algorithm can accurately recover spectral features from noisy data. To
illustrate the utility of our method on real data, we demonstrate the superior
performance of the SGSE method relative to standard cluster-based techniques

The orbital distribution of many Kuiper belt objects is strongly affected by
dynamical interactions with Neptune, and the structure cannot be understood
without taking this into account. We present the debiased Kuiper belt as
measured by the Canada-France Ecliptic Plane Survey (CFEPS). This model
includes the absolute populations for objects with diameters >100 km, measured
orbital distributions, and size distributions of the components of the Kuiper
belt: the classical belt (hot, stirred, and kernel components), the scattering
disk, the detached objects, and the resonant objects (1:1, 5:4, 4:3, 3:2
including Kozai subcomponent, 5:3, 7:4, 2:1, 7:3, 5:2, 3:1, and 5:1). Because a
large fraction of known debris disks are consistent with dust at Kuiper belt
distances from the host stars, the CFEPS Kuiper belt model provides an
excellent starting point for a debris disk model, as the dynamical interactions
with planets interior to the disk are well-understood and can be precisely
modelled using orbital integrations.

dynamical evolution of the disk during planetesimal formation and growth. To
predict the diversity of exoplanet compositions, previous works modeled
planetesimal composition as the equilibrium chemical composition of a proto-
planetary disk at a single time. However, planetesimals form over an extended
period of time, during which, elements sequentially condense out of the gas as
the disk cools and are accreted onto planetesi- mals. To account for the
evolution of the disk during planetesimal formation, we couple models of disk
chemistry and dynamics with a prescription for planetesimal formation. We then
follow the growth of these planetesimals into terrestrial planets with N-body
simulations of late stage planet formation to evaluate the effect of sequential
condensation on the bulk composition of planets. We find that our model
produces results similar to those of earlier models for disks with C/O ratios
close to the solar value (0.54). However, in disks with C/O ratios greater than
0.8, carbon rich planetesimals form throughout a much larger radial range of
the disk. Furthermore, our model produces carbon rich planetesimals in disks
with C/O ratios as low as ~0.65, which is not possible in the static
equilibrium chemistry case. These results suggest that (1) there may be a large
population of short period carbon rich planets around moderately carbon
enhanced stars (0.65 < C/O < 0.8) and (2) carbon rich planets can form
throughout the terrestrial planet region around carbon rich stars (C/O > 0.8).

plateaus at magnetizations M=1/8, M=3/16, M=1/4, and M=1/2. While the plateau
at M=1/4 can be understood in a semi-classical fashion in terms of diagonal

planted bisection model, is a popular model of random graph exhibiting a
cluster behaviour. In the symmetric case, the graph has two equally sized
clusters and vertices connect with probability $p$ within clusters and $q$
across clusters. In the past two decades, a large body of literature in
statistics and computer science has focused on providing lower-bounds on the
scaling of $|p-q|$ to ensure exact recovery. In this paper, we identify a sharp
threshold phenomenon for exact recovery: if $\alpha=pn/\log(n)$ and
$\beta=qn/\log(n)$ are constant (with $\alpha>\beta$), recovering the
communities with high probability is possible if $\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2} -
\sqrt{\alpha \beta}>1$ and impossible if $\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2} - \sqrt{\alpha
\beta}<1$. In particular, this improves the existing bounds. This also sets a
new line of sight for efficient clustering algorithms. While maximum likelihood
(ML) achieves the optimal threshold (by definition), it is in the worst-case
NP-hard. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm based on a semidefinite
programming relaxation of ML, which is proved to succeed in recovering the
communities close to the threshold, while numerical experiments suggest it may
achieve the threshold. An efficient algorithm which succeeds all the way down
to the threshold is also obtained using a partial recovery algorithm combined
with a local improvement procedure.

deuteration in the warm inner gas than in the cold external envelope. We
coupled a gas-grain astrochemical model with a one-dimension model of
collapsing core to properly follow the formation and the deuteration of
interstellar ices as well as their subsequent evaporation in the low-mass
protostellar envelopes with the aim of interpreting the spatial and temporal
evolutions of their deuteration. The astrochemical model follows the formation
and the evaporation of ices with a multilayer approach and also includes a
state-of-the-art deuterated chemical network by taking the spin states of H$_2$
and light ions into account. Because of their slow formation, interstellar ices
are chemically heterogeneous and show an increase of their deuterium
fractionation towards the surface. The differentiation of the deuteration in
ices induces an evolution of the deuteration within protostellar envelopes. The
warm inner region is poorly deuterated because it includes the whole molecular
content of ices while the deuteration predicted in the cold external envelope
scales with the highly deuterated surface of ices. We are able to reproduce the
observed evolution of water deuteration within protostellar envelopes but we
are still unable to predict the super-high deuteration observed for
formaldehyde and methanol. Finally, the extension of this study to the
deuteration of complex organics (COMs), important for the prebiotic chemistry,
shows a good agreement with the observations, suggesting that we can use the
deuteration to retrace their mechanisms and their moments of formation.

  A graph parameter is said to be estimable if it converges along every
Benjamini-Schramm convergent sparse graph sequence. We prove that the
normalized logarithm of the number of matchings is estimable. We also show that
the analogous statement for perfect matchings already fails for d-regular

analyzing the probability that a randomly chosen perfect matching contains a

been interpreted as a sign of the untenability of the classical concept of a
particle and as a premonition that quantum theory is needed. This idea of a
quantum connection stubbornly persists in the literature, even though it has
also been criticized frequently. Here we shall argue that although this
criticism is justified, the proposed alternative solutions have often been
wrong and have not put the paradox in its right perspective. In fact, the Gibbs
paradox is unrelated to fundamental issues of particle identity; only
distinguishability in a pragmatic sense plays a role (in this we develop ideas
of van Kampen [10]), and in principle the paradox always is there as long as
the concept of a particle applies at all. In line with this we show that the
paradox survives even in quantum mechanics, in spite of the quantum mechanical
(anti-)symmetrization postulates.

requests is critical to the success of the community, the factors that lead
community members to satisfy a request are largely unknown. Success of a
request depends on factors like who is asking, how they are asking, when are
they asking, and most critically what is being requested, ranging from small
favors to substantial monetary donations. We present a case study of altruistic
requests in an online community where all requests ask for the very same
contribution and do not offer anything tangible in return, allowing us to
disentangle what is requested from textual and social factors. Drawing from
social psychology literature, we extract high-level social features from text
that operationalize social relations between recipient and donor and
demonstrate that these extracted relations are predictive of success. More
specifically, we find that clearly communicating need through the narrative is
essential and that that linguistic indications of gratitude, evidentiality, and
generalized reciprocity, as well as high status of the asker further increase
the likelihood of success. Building on this understanding, we develop a model
that can predict the success of unseen requests, significantly improving over
several baselines. We link these findings to research in psychology on helping
behavior, providing a basis for further analysis of success in social media
systems.

protoplanetary disc may sculpt the dust distribution such that it
observationally presents as a `transition' disc. We concern ourselves with
`transition' discs that have large holes ($\gtrsim 10$ AU) and high accretion
rates ($\sim 10^{-9}-10^{-8}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$). Particularly, those discs
which photoevaporative models struggle to explain. Assuming the standard
picture for how massive planets sculpt their parent discs, along with the
observed accretion rates in `transition' discs, we find that the accretion
luminosity from the forming planet is significant, and can dominate over the
stellar luminosity at the gap edge. This planetary accretion luminosity can
apply a significant radiation pressure to small ($s\lesssim 1\mu$m) dust
particles provided they are suitably decoupled from the gas. Secular evolution
calculations that account for the evolution of the gas and dust components in a
disc with an embedded, accreting planet, show that only with the addition of
the radiation pressure can we explain the full observed characteristics of a
`transition' disc (NIR dip in the SED, mm cavity and high accretion rate). At
suitably high planet masses ($\gtrsim 3-4$ M$_J$), radiation pressure from the
accreting planet is able to hold back the small dust particles, producing a
heavily dust-depleted inner disc that is optically thin (vertically and
radially) to Infra-Red radiation. We use our models to calculate synthetic
observations and present a observational evolutionary scenario for a forming
planet, sculpting its parent disc. The planet-disc system will present as a
`transition' disc with a dip in the SED, only when the planet mass and
planetary accretion rate is high enough. At other times it will present as a
disc with a primordial SED, but with a cavity in the mm, as observed in a
handful of protoplanetary discs.

point spread function of the central star and to subtract its flux contribution
to reveal nearby faint companion planets. The current version of the package
does this correction by using a principal component analysis method to build a
basis set for modelling the point spread function of the observations. We
demonstrate the performance of the package by reanalysing publicly available
data on the exoplanet beta Pictoris b, which consists of close to 24,000
individual image frames. We show that PynPoint is able to analyse this typical
data in roughly 1.5 minutes on a Mac Pro, when the number of images is reduced
by co-adding in sets of 5. The main computational work parallelises well as a
result of a reliance on SciPy and NumPy functions. For this calculation the
peak memory load is 6Gb, which can be run comfortably on most workstations. A
simpler calculation, by co-adding over 50, takes 3 seconds with a peak memory
usage of 600 Mb. This can be performed easily on a laptop. In developing the
package we have modularised the code so that we will be able to extend
functionality in future releases, through the inclusion of more modules,
without it affecting the users application programming interface. We distribute
the PynPoint package through the central PyPi sever, and the documentation is
available online (http://pynpoint.ethz.ch).

the dynamical evolution of star clusters. Specifically we compare the mass loss
rate, velocity dispersion, relaxation time, and the mass function of star
clusters on circular and eccentric orbits. For a given perigalactic distance,
increasing orbital eccentricity slows the dynamical evolution of a cluster due
to a weaker mean tidal field. However, we find that perigalactic passes and
tidal heating due to an eccentric orbit can partially compensate for the
decreased mean tidal field by energizing stars to higher velocities and
stripping additional stars from the cluster, accelerating the relaxation
process. We find that the corresponding circular orbit which best describes the
evolution of a cluster on an eccentric orbit is much less than its semi-major
axis or time averaged galactocentric distance. Since clusters spend the
majority of their lifetimes near apogalacticon, the properties of clusters
which appear very dynamically evolved for a given galactocentric distance can
be explained by an eccentric orbit. Additionally we find that the evolution of
the slope of the mass function within the core radius is roughly
orbit-independent, so it could place additional constraints on the initial mass
and initial size of globular clusters with solved orbits. We use our results to
demonstrate how the orbit of Milky Way globular clusters can be constrained
given standard observable parameters like galactocentric distance and the slope
of the mass function. We then place constraints on the unsolved orbits of NGC
1261,NGC 6352, NGC 6496, and NGC 6304 based on their positions and mass
functions.

density structure before and shortly after the onset of massive star formation,
with peak surface densities >~ 1 g cm^-2. Quiescent cores and filaments show
smoothly varying temperatures from 10-20 K, rising to over 40 K in star-forming

IMF parameters when the likelihood function is described by a tapered power law
function, a lognormal distribution at low masses coupled to a power law at
higher masses, and a multi-component power law function. The inter-cluster
comparison of the pPDFs of the IMF parameters for each likelihood function
shows that these distributions do not overlap within the $1\sigma$ uncertainty
level. Furthermore, the most probable values of the IMF parameters for most of
the clusters deviate substantially from their values for the Galactic field
stellar IMF. We also quantify the effects of taking into account the
completeness correction as well as the uncertainties on the measured masses.
The inclusion of the former affects the inferred pPDFs of the slope of the IMF

of the IMF in the intermediate- to high mass regime. As variations are observed
in all of the IMF parameters at once and for each of the considered likelihood
functions, even for completeness corrected samples, we argue that the observed
variations are real and significant, at least for the sample of eight clusters
considered in this work. The results presented here clearly show that the IMF

altitude as at depth: even though gas at altitude is much too rarefied to be
itself self-gravitating, it is strongly forced by self-gravitating
overdensities at the midplane. The long-range nature of gravity means that
turbulent velocities are nearly uniform vertically, increasing by just a factor
of 2 from midplane to surface, even as the density ranges over nearly three
orders of magnitude. The insensitivity of gravito-turbulence to height
contrasts with the behavior of disks afflicted by the magnetorotational
instability (MRI); in the latter case, non-circular velocities increase by at
least a factor of 15 from midplane to surface, with various non-ideal effects
only magnifying this factor. The distinct vertical profiles of

the same, oft-reported observation of in vivo tumors. Specifically, an oblate
ellipsoidal tumor shape robustly occurs when the tumors grow in hydrogels that
are stiffer than the tumors, but when they grow in more compliant hydrogels
they remain closer to spherical in shape. Using large scale, nonlinear
elasticity computations we show that the oblate ellipsoidal shape minimizes the
elastic free energy of the tumor-hydrogel system. Having eliminated a number of
other candidate explanations, we hypothesize that minimization of the elastic

  We analyze two versions of an AIG based on the set-cover optimization

set-cover problem, with each subset (of a given universe of elements)
representing the strategy of a single agent. Outcomes are covers computed from

variant utilizes a non-deterministic form of the greedy algorithm. We
characterize Nash equilibrium strategies for both versions of the game, finding
that agents' strategies can vary considerably between the two settings. In
particular, we find that the version of the game based on the deterministic
algorithm only admits Nash equilibrium in which agents choose strategies (i.e.,
subsets) containing at most one element, with no two agents picking the same
element. On the other hand, in the version of the game based on the

""evolving dimensions"" in which the dimensions open up as the temperature of the
universe drops. We adopt the string theory framework in which the dimensions
are fields that live on the string worldsheet, and add temperature dependent
mass terms for them. At the Big Bang, all the dimensions are very heavy and are
not excited. As the universe cools down, dimensions open up one by one. Thus,
the dimensionality of the space we live in depends on the energy or temperature
that we are probing. In particular, we provide a kinematic Brandenberger-Vafa
argument for how a discrete {\it causal set}, and eventually a continuum
$(3+1)$-dim spacetime along with Einstein gravity emerge in the Infrared from
the worldsheet action. The $(3+1)$-dim Planck mass and the string scale become
directly related, {\it without any} compactification. Amongst other
predictions, we argue that LHC might be blind to new physics even if it comes
at the TeV scale. In contrast, cosmic ray experiments, especially those that

impurities coupled to interacting quantum wires described by a
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. The method is negative-sign free for any values of
the Tomonaga-Luttinger parameter, which is rigorously proved, and thus,
efficient low-temperature calculations are possible. Duality between electrons
and bosons in one dimensional systems allows us to construct a simple formula
for the CTQMC algorithm in these systems. We show that the CTQMC for
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids can be implemented with only minor modifications of
previous CTQMC codes developed for impurities coupled to non-interacting
fermions. We apply this method to the Kane-Fisher model of a potential
scatterer in a spin-less quantum wire and to a single spin coupled with the
edge state of a two-dimensional topological insulator assuming an anisotropic
XXZ coupling. Various dynamical response functions such as the electron Green's
function and spin-spin correlation functions are calculated numerically and
their scaling properties are discussed.

collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=62.4$ GeV. The data were collected in 2010 by
the PHENIX experiment that included the new hadron-blind detector. The
invariant yield of electrons from heavy-flavor decays is measured as a function
of transverse momentum in the range $1<p_T^e<5$ GeV/$c$. The invariant yield
per binary collision is slightly enhanced above the $p$$+$$p$ reference in
Au$+$Au 0%--20%, 20%--40% and 40%--60% centralities at a comparable level. This
may be a result of the interplay between initial-state Cronin effects,
final-state flow, and energy loss for heavy-quark production at this low beam
energy. The $v_2$ of electrons from heavy-flavor decays is nonzero when
averaged between $1.3<p_T^e<2.5$ GeV/$c$ from $0<{\rm centrality}<40$%
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=62.4$ GeV. For 20%--40% centrality collisions,
the $v_2$ at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=62.4$ GeV is smaller than that for heavy flavor
decays at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV. The $v_2$ of the electrons from
heavy-flavor decay at the lower beam energy is also smaller than $v_2$ for
pions. Both results indicate that the heavy-quarks interact with the medium
formed in these collisions, but they may not be at the same level of
thermalization with the medium as observed at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV.

the microscale, the representative volume element consists in piezoelectric

$\beta$, from finite size scaling analysis. We find that the critical

machines can simulate each other within a polynomially overhead in time. Is
$\lambda$-calculus a reasonable machine? Is there a way to measure the
computational complexity of a $\lambda$-term? This paper presents the first
complete positive answer to this long-standing problem. Moreover, our answer is
completely machine-independent and based over a standard notion in the theory
of $\lambda$-calculus: the length of a leftmost-outermost derivation to normal
form is an invariant cost model. Such a theorem cannot be proved by directly
relating $\lambda$-calculus with Turing machines or random access machines,
because of the size explosion problem: there are terms that in a linear number
of steps produce an exponentially long output. The first step towards the
solution is to shift to a notion of evaluation for which the length and the
size of the output are linearly related. This is done by adopting the linear
substitution calculus (LSC), a calculus of explicit substitutions modelled
after linear logic and proof-nets and admitting a decomposition of
leftmost-outermost derivations with the desired property. Thus, the LSC is
invariant with respect to, say, random access machines. The second step is to
show that LSC is invariant with respect to the $\lambda$-calculus. The size
explosion problem seems to imply that this is not possible: having the same
notions of normal form, evaluation in the LSC is exponentially longer than in
the $\lambda$-calculus. We solve such an impasse by introducing a new form of
shared normal form and shared reduction, deemed useful. Useful evaluation
avoids those steps that only unshare the output without contributing to
$\beta$-redexes, i.e., the steps that cause the blow-up in size.

intrinsic flat limits of complete Riemannian manifolds. In
\cite{SormaniWenger2010, SormaniWenger2011}, Sormani-Wenger show that for a
sequence of Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, a uniform
upper bound on diameter, and non-collapsed volume, the intrinsic flat limit
exists and agrees with the Gromov-Hausdorff limit. This can be viewed as a
non-cancellation theorem showing that for such sequences, points don't cancel
each other out in the limit.
  Here we prove a similar no-cancellation theorem, replacing the assumption of
nonnegative Ricci curvature with a two-sided bound on Ricci curvature. This
version corrects a mistake in the previous version of this paper (where we
assume only an arbitrary lower Ricci bound) which was due to a crucial error in
one of our supporting theorems for that argument.

of play one of K arms, each characterized by an unknown reward distribution.
Reward realizations are only observed when an arm is selected, and the
gambler's objective is to maximize his cumulative expected earnings over some
given horizon of play T. To do this, the gambler needs to acquire information
about arms (exploration) while simultaneously optimizing immediate rewards
(exploitation); the price paid due to this trade off is often referred to as
the regret, and the main question is how small can this price be as a function
of the horizon length T. This problem has been studied extensively when the
reward distributions do not change over time; an assumption that supports a
sharp characterization of the regret, yet is often violated in practical
settings. In this paper, we focus on a MAB formulation which allows for a broad
range of temporal uncertainties in the rewards, while still maintaining
mathematical tractability. We fully characterize the (regret) complexity of
this class of MAB problems by establishing a direct link between the extent of
allowable reward ""variation"" and the minimal achievable regret. Our analysis
draws some connections between two rather disparate strands of literature: the
adversarial and the stochastic MAB frameworks.

ApJ in press",,"10.1088/0004-637X/794/2/173",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the radial migration of stars driven by recurring multi-arm spiral
features in an exponential disk embedded in a dark matter halo. The spiral
perturbations redistribute angular momentum within the disk and lead to
substantial radial displacements of individual stars, in a manner that largely
preserves the circularity of their orbits and that results, after 5 Gyr (~40
full rotations at the disk scalelength), in little radial heating and no
appreciable changes to the vertical or radial structure of the disk. Our
results clarify a number of issues related to the spatial distribution and
kinematics of migrators. In particular, we find that migrators are a heavily
biased subset of stars with preferentially low vertical velocity dispersions.
This ""provenance bias"" for migrators is not surprising in hindsight, for stars
with small vertical excursions spend more time near the disk plane and thus
respond more readily to non-axisymmetric perturbations. We also find that the
vertical velocity dispersion of outward migrators always decreases, whereas the
opposite holds for inward migrators. To first order, newly arrived migrators
simply replace stars that have migrated off to other radii, thus inheriting the
vertical bias of the latter. Extreme migrators might therefore be recognized,
if present, by the unexpectedly small amplitude of their vertical excursions.
Our results show that migration, understood as changes in angular momentum that
preserve circularity, can affect strongly the thin disk, but cast doubts on
models that envision the Galactic thick disk as a relic of radial migration.

Our MCMC algorithm uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in a restricted Gibbs sampling

demonstrate the superior performance of hyper-LASSO priors, and to investigate

on the stack equivalent complex conductivity. The proposed concepts are first
theoretically studied and then demonstrated experimentally via a detailed
procedure allowing extraction of the parameters of each layer independently and

pattern of neuronal populations. Whereas these oscillations have been studied
predominantly in local circuits, here we show how the topology of large-scale

resting state. We find that the hierarchical modular organization of neuronal
networks supports distinct spectral patterns of neural rhythms similar to those
observed experimentally in different species such as rat and human. For
individual neurons, multiple peak frequencies with non-integer ratios between
subsequent peaks occurred. These ratios occurred both for models with the
spatial size of the rat as well as for the human brain. We argue that the
potential influence of longer connections, and thus longer delays, are balanced
by a reduced number of long-distance connections in larger brain networks. In
conclusion, we show that a hierarchical neuronal network provides a scalable
backbone for multiple brain rhythms. This structural backbone could complement
well-studied regional and cellular mechanisms for the generation or prevention
of rhythms.

temperature with upper branch and effective range effects. Based on a general
effective Lagrangian that reproduces precisely the two-body $s$-wave scattering
phase shift, we obtain a nonperturbative expression of the energy density as a
function of the polarization by using the Bethe-Goldstone ladder resummation.
For hard sphere potential, the predicted critical gas parameter $k_{\rm
F}a=0.816$ and the spin susceptibility agree well with the results from
fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. In general, positive and
negative effective ranges have opposite effects on the critical gas parameter
$k_{\rm F}a$: While a positive effective range reduces the critical gas
parameter, a negative effective range increases it. For attractive potential or
Feshbach resonance model, the many-body upper branch exhibits an energy maximum
at $k_{\rm F}a=\alpha$ with $\alpha=1.34$ from the Bethe-Goldstone ladder
resummation, which is qualitatively consistent with experimental results. The
many-body T-matrix has a positive-energy pole for $k_{\rm F}a>\alpha$ and it
becomes impossible to distinguish the bound state and the scattering state.
These positive-energy bound states become occupied and therefore the upper
branch reaches an energy maximum at $k_{\rm F}a=\alpha$. In the zero range
limit, there exists a narrow window ($0.86<k_{\rm F}a<1.56$) for the
ferromagnetic phase. At sufficiently large negative effective range, the
ferromagnetic phase disappears. On the other hand, the appearance of
positive-energy bound state resonantly enhances the two-body decay rate around
$k_{\rm F}a=\alpha$ and may prevent the study of equilibrium phases and
ferromagnetism of the upper branch Fermi gas.

water distribution network, a large population of consumers may become exposed
to the contaminant. A contamination event may be poorly predictable dynamic
process due to the interactions of consumers and utility managers during an
event. Consumers that become aware of a threat may select protective actions
that change their water demands from typical demand patterns, and new hydraulic
conditions can arise that differ from conditions that are predicted when
demands are considered as exogenous inputs. Consequently, the movement of the
contaminant plume in the pipe network may shift from its expected trajectory. A
sociotechnical model is developed here to integrate agent-based models of
consumers with an engineering water distribution system model and capture the
dynamics between consumer behaviors and the water distribution system for
predicting contaminant transport and public exposure. Consumers are simulated
as agents with behaviors defined for water use activities, mobility,
word-of-mouth communication, and demand reduction, based on a set of rules
representing an agents autonomy and reaction to health impacts, the
environment, and the actions of other agents. As consumers decrease their water
use, the demand exerted on the water distribution system is updated; as the
flow directions and volumes shift in response, the location of the contaminant
plume is updated and the amount of contaminant consumed by each agent is
calculated. The framework is tested through simulating realistic contamination
scenarios for a virtual city and water distribution system.

and beyond is critical for an accurate determination of cluster masses and to
ensure unbiased cosmological parameter estimates from cluster surveys. This
problem has drawn renewed interest due to recent determinations of gas mass
fractions beyond R200, which appear to be considerably larger than the cosmic
mean, and because the clusters' total Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux receives a
significant contribution from these regions. Here, we use a large suite of
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the clumpiness of density and
pressure and employ different variants of simulated physics, including
radiative gas physics and thermal feedback by active galactic nuclei. We find
that density and pressure clumping closely trace each other as a function of
radius, but the bias on density remains on average < 20% within the virial
radius R200. At larger radius, clumping increases steeply due to the continuous
infall of coherent structures that have not yet passed the accretion shock.
Density and pressure clumping increase with cluster mass and redshift, which
probes on average dynamically younger objects that are still in the process of
assembling. The angular power spectra of gas density and pressure show that the
clumping signal is dominated by comparably large substructures with scales
>R200/5, signaling the presence of gravitationally-driven ""super-clumping"". In
contrast, the angular power spectrum of the dark matter (DM) shows an almost
uniform size distribution due to unimpeded subhalos. The quadrupolar anisotropy
dominates the signal and correlates well across different radii as a result of
the prolateness of the DM potential. We provide a synopsis of the radial
dependence of the clusters' non-equilibrium measures (kinetic pressure support,
ellipticity, and clumping) that all increase sharply beyond R200.

allow one to manipulate asymmetry between two underlying sublattices of

honeycomb lattices, we explore magnetism induced by breaking sublattice
symmetry through saturating chemical bonds on one-side of the buckled honeycomb
lattice. It is shown that when fractions of chemical bonds on one-side are
saturated, two narrow bands always exist at half filling. Furthermore, the
narrow bands generally support flat band ferromagnetism in the presence of the
Hubbard $U$ interaction. The induced magnetization is directly related to the
saturation fraction and is thus controllable in magnitude through the
saturation fraction. Most importantly, we find that depending on the saturation
fraction, the ground state of an one-side saturated germanene may become a
quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator characterized by a Chern number that
vanishes for larger magnetization. The non-vanishing Chern number for smaller

usually suffer from two problems. First, it has to solve a large-scale
optimization problem with high computational complexity in dictionary learning.
Second, each patch is considered independently in dictionary learning and
sparse coding, which ignores the relationship among patches, resulting in
inaccurate sparse coding coefficients. In this paper, instead of using patch as
the basic unit of sparse representation, we exploit the concept of group as the
basic unit of sparse representation, which is composed of nonlocal patches with
similar structures, and establish a novel sparse representation modeling of
natural images, called group-based sparse representation (GSR). The proposed
GSR is able to sparsely represent natural images in the domain of group, which
enforces the intrinsic local sparsity and nonlocal self-similarity of images
simultaneously in a unified framework. Moreover, an effective self-adaptive
dictionary learning method for each group with low complexity is designed,
rather than dictionary learning from natural images. To make GSR tractable and
robust, a split Bregman based technique is developed to solve the proposed
GSR-driven minimization problem for image restoration efficiently. Extensive
experiments on image inpainting, image deblurring and image compressive sensing
recovery manifest that the proposed GSR modeling outperforms many current

train in vacuum, its velocity is just the speed of light. When it tunnels
through a barrier as a particle, its wave function collapses and it will travel
faster than light. Superluminal propagation can occur only within the coherence
length and the time constrained by uncertainty principle. A massive particle
cannot be superluminal during the tunneling process. So superluminality does
not violate causality. As for the superluminal and negative group velocities in
anomalously dispersive medium, they are merely reshaping effect of the pulse,
and they will become subluminal at large distances. A couple of experiments are
proposed to test the superluminal phenomena.

efficient in solving combinatorial problems. ASP solvers implement the stable
model semantics that eliminates circular derivations between Boolean variables
from the solutions of a logic program. Due to this, ASP solvers are better
suited than propositional satisfiability (SAT) and Constraint Programming (CP)
solvers to solve a certain class of problems whose specification includes
inductive definitions such as reachability in a graph. On the other hand, ASP
solvers suffer from the grounding bottleneck that occurs due to their inability
to model finite domain variables. Furthermore, the existing stable model
semantics are not sufficient to disallow circular reasoning on the bounds of
numeric variables. An example where this is required is in modelling shortest
paths between nodes in a graph. Just as reachability can be encoded as an
inductive definition with one or more base cases and recursive rules, shortest
paths between nodes can also be modelled with similar base cases and recursive
rules for their upper bounds. This deficiency of stable model semantics
introduces another type of grounding bottleneck in ASP systems that cannot be
removed by naively merging ASP with CP solvers, but requires a theoretical
extension of the semantics from Booleans and normal rules to bounds over
numeric variables and more general rules. In this work, we propose Bound
Founded Answer Set Programming (BFASP) that resolves this issue and
consequently, removes all types of grounding bottleneck inherent in ASP
systems.

  technological singularity",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most significant developments in the history of human being is the
invention of a way of keeping records of human knowledge, thoughts and ideas.
In 1926, the work of several thinkers such as Edouard Le Roy, Vladimir
Vernadsky and Teilhard de Chardin led to the concept of noosphere, thus the
idea that human cognition and knowledge transforms the biosphere coming to be
something like the planet's thinking layer. At present, is commonly accepted by
some thinkers that the Internet is the medium that brings life to noosphere.
According to Vinge and Kurzweil's technological singularity hypothesis,
noosphere would be in the future the natural environment in which
'human-machine superintelligence' emerges after to reach the point of
technological singularity. In this paper we show by means of a numerical model
the impossibility that our civilization reaches the point of technological
singularity in the near future. We propose that this point may be reached when
Internet data centers are based on ""computer machines"" to be more effective in
terms of power consumption than current ones. We speculate about what we have
called 'Nooscomputer' or N-computer a hypothetical machine which would consume
far less power allowing our civilization to reach the point of technological
singularity.

China. The purpose of this paper is to report a qualitative study of Chinese
professional working mothers that explored the perceptions of online Master's
of Business Administration (MBA) programmes as a tool for career progression
for working mothers balancing work and family in China. The objective was to
examine existing work-family and career progression conflicts, the perceived
usefulness of online MBA in balancing work-family and career aspirations, and
the perceived ease of use of e-learning. Using Davis's (1989) technology
acceptance model (TAM), the research drew on in-depth interviews with 10 female
part-time MBA students from a university in Wuhan. The data were analysed
through coding and transcribing. The findings showed that conflicts arose where
demanding work schedules competed with family obligations, studies, and caring
for children and the elderly. Online MBA programmes were viewed as a viable
tool for balancing work and family and studying, given its flexible time
management capabilities. However, consideration must be given to address
students' motivation issues, lack of networking, lack of face-to-face
interaction, and quality. The research findings emphasise the pragmatic need to
re-align higher education policy and practice to position higher education
e-learning as a trustable education delivery channel in China. By shedding
light on the prevailing work-family conflict experienced by women seeking
career advancement, this study suggests developing better gender-supporting
policies and innovative e-learning practices to champion online MBA programme

reducing the burden imposed to the system. Herein, we propose a semi-supervised
incremental learning framework for evolving visual streams in order to develop
a robust and flexible track classification system. Our proposed method learns
from consecutive batches by updating an ensemble in each time. It tries to
strike a balance between performance of the system and amount of data which
needs to be labelled. As no restriction is considered, the system can address
many practical problems in an evolving multi-camera scenario, such as concept
drift, class evolution and various length of video streams which have not been
addressed before. Experiments were performed on synthetic as well as real-world
visual data in non-stationary environments, showing high accuracy with fairly

we reconstruct the conformal type of the unknown open, relatively compact set
$W\subset M$, when we are given $V$, the conformal class of $g|_V$, and the
light observations sets $P_V(q)$ corresponding to all source points $q$ in $W$.
The light observation set $P_V(q)$ is the intersection of $V$ and the
light-cone emanating from the point $q$, i.e., the points in the set $V$ where
light from a point source at $q$ is observed.
  2. Active measurements in spacetime: We develop a new method for inverse
problems for non-linear hyperbolic equations that utilizes the non-linearity as
a tool. This enables us to solve inverse problems for non-linear equations for
which the corresponding problems for linear equations are still unsolved. To
illustrate this method, we solve an inverse problem for semilinear wave
equations with quadratic non-linearities. We assume that we are given the
neighborhood $V$ of the time-like geodesic $\mu$ and the source-to-solution
operator that maps the source supported on $V$ to the restriction of the
solution of the wave equation in $V$. When $M$ is 4-dimensional, we show that
these data determine the topological, differentiable, and conformal structures

observed $p$ time series are linear combinations of $p$ latent uncorrelated
weakly stationary time series. The aim is then to find an estimate for an
unmixing matrix, which transforms the observed time series back to uncorrelated
latent time series. In SOBI (Second Order Blind Identification) joint
diagonalization of the covariance matrix and autocovariance matrices with
several lags is used to estimate the unmixing matrix. The rows of an unmixing
matrix can be derived either one by one (deflation-based approach) or
simultaneously (symmetric approach). The latter of these approaches is
well-known especially in signal processing literature, however, the rigorous
analysis of its statistical properties has been missing so far. In this paper,
we fill this gap and investigate the statistical properties of the symmetric
SOBI estimate in detail and find its limiting distribution under general
conditions. The asymptotical efficiencies of symmetric SOBI estimate are
compared to those of recently introduced deflation-based SOBI estimate under
general multivariate MA$(\infty)$ processes. The theory is illustrated by some

self-organise into two macroscopic coherent `Onsager vortex' clusters that are

mechanism --- the evaporative heating of the vortices --- that results in a
negative temperature phase transition in the vortex degrees of freedom. At the

presentation of the shrinkage anisotropy concept is suggested through the
sample/layer size ratios. The work objective is reached in two steps. First,
the relations are derived between the indicated soil shrinkage anisotropy
characteristics and three different shrinkage curves of a soil relating to:
small samples (without cracking at shrinkage), sufficiently large samples (with
internal cracking), and layers of similar thickness. Then, the results of a
recent work with respect to the physical prediction of the three shrinkage
curves are used. These results connect the shrinkage curves with the initial
sample size/layer thickness as well as characteristics of soil texture and
structure (both inter- and intra-aggregate) as physical parameters. The
parameters determining the reference shrinkage curve (relating to the small
samples) and initial sample size/layer thickness are needed for the prediction
of the above soil shrinkage anisotropy characteristics. Using the available
data on two soils and samples of two essentially different sizes, illustrative
estimates of the relative sample sizes, new characteristic of the shrinkage
anisotropy, and shrinkage geometry factor are given as the physically predicted

a statistical study of the redshift evolution out to redshift one of the
magnitude gap between the first and the second brightest cluster galaxies of a
well defined mass-selected group sample. We find that the slope of the relation
between the fraction of groups and the magnitude gap steepens with redshift,
indicating a larger fraction of fossil groups at lower redshifts. We find that
22.2$\pm$6% of our groups at z$\leq$0.6 are fossil groups. We compare our
results with the predictions of three semi-analytic models based on the
Millennium simulation. The intercept of the relation between the magnitude of
the brightest galaxy and the value of magnitude gap becomes brighter with
increasing redshift. This trend is steeper than the model predictions which we
attribute to the younger stellar age of the observed brightest cluster
galaxies. This trend argues in favor of stronger evolution of the feedback from
active galactic nuclei at z<1 compared to the models. The slope of the relation
between the magnitude of the brightest cluster galaxy and the value of the gap
does not evolve with redshift and is well reproduced by the models, indicating
that the tidal galaxy stripping, put forward as an explanation of the

represents a drainage that matches observational findings. A more dynamic phase

reconnection event when the core prominence plasma weighs down the fieldlines

atmospheric perturbations. The differential squared visibilities allow to keep
a larger fraction of data with respect to selected absolute squared
visibilities and thus benefit from reduced temporal dispersion, while their
distribution is more clearly characterized. The frame selection based on the

gravitational potential of the dark matter halo (DMH) and super massive black
hole (SMBH) under the assumptions of isothermal, spherically symmetric and
steady state. It is clarified that the gravity of SMBH adds a new branch of
transonic solutions with the transonic point in very close proximity to the
centre in addition to the outer transonic point generated by the gravity of
DMH. Because these two transonic solutions have substantially different mass
fluxes and starting points, these solutions may have different influences on
the evolution of galaxies and the release of metals into intergalactic space.
We have applied our model to the Sombrero galaxy and obtained a new type of
galactic outflow: a slowly accelerated transonic outflow through the transonic
point at very distant region ($\simeq 126$\ kpc). In this galaxy, previous
works reported that although the trace of the galactic outflow is observed by
X-ray, the gas density distribution is consistent with the hydrostatic state.
We have clarified that the slowly accelerating outflow has a gas density
profile quite similar to that of the hydrostatic solution in the widely spread
subsonic region. Thus, the slowly accelerating transonic solution cannot be
distinguished from the hydrostatic solution in the observed region ($\leq 25$\
kpc) even if slow transonic flow exists. Our model provides a new perspective
of galactic outflows and is applicable even to quiescent galaxies with inactive
star formation.

index smaller than one and the observations of the violation of the isotropy

coupled to torsion, can account for small scale - large scale discrepancy and
larger peculiar velocities (bulk flows) for galaxy clusters. The nonvanishing
total angular momentum (torsion) of the Universe enters as a negative effective
density term in the Einstein-Cartan equations causing partial cancellation of
the mass density. The integrated Sachs-Wolfe contribution of the
Einstein-Cartan model is negative, thus it can provide partial cancellation of
the large scale power of the TT CMB spectrum. The observed violation of the

the spin densities of light Majorana neutrinos in the early stage of the

Frontier Fields. Such faint galaxies are hosted by dark matter halos of mass
$\sim10^9 M_\odot$ and dominate the ionizing photon budget over currently
observed bright galaxies, thus allowing for the first time the investigation of
the dominant reionization sources. In addition, the observed number of these
galaxies can be used to constrain the role of feedback in suppressing star
formation in small halos: for example, if galaxy formation is suppressed in
halos with circular velocity $v_c < 50$ km s$^{-1}$, galaxies fainter than
$m=31$ should not be detected in the FFs.

Hinode, the existence of a broad distribution of blue and red Dopplershift in

depends on the peak temperature of formation of the observed spectral lines. To
reproduce those observations, we use a nanoflare heating model for
multi-stranded coronal loops (Sarkar and Walsh 2008, 2009) and a set of
spectral lines covering a broad range of temperature (from 0.25 MK to 5.6 MK).
We first show that red- and blueshifts are ubiquitous in all wavelength ranges;
redshifts/downflows dominating cool spectral lines (from O V to Si VII) and
blueshifts/upflows dominating the hot lines (from Fe XV to Ca XVII). These
Dopplershifts are indicative of plasma condensation and evaporation. By
computing the average Dopplershift, we derive a new temperature diagnostic for
coronal loops: the temperature at which the average Dopplershift vanishes
estimates the mean temperature of the plasma along the coronal loop and at the
footpoints. To compare closely with observations, we model dense and sparse
Hinode/EIS rasters at the instrument resolution. The temperature diagnostic
provides the same temperature estimates as the model whatever the type of
raster or the viewing angle. To conclude, we have developed a robust
temperature diagnostic to measure the plasma temperature of a coronal loop

these two transonic solutions have different mass fluxes and starting points,
these solutions will make different influences to the star formation rate, the

paper, we present such a straightforward and efficient preprocessing approach

the fact that the extreme points of a point set do not alter when all points

sets. These 16 extreme points are then used to form a convex polygon. We check
all input points and discard the points that locate inside the convex polygon.
We use the remaining points to calculate the expected convex hull. Experimental
results show that: when employing the proposed preprocessing algorithm, it
achieves the speedups of about 4x ~5x on average and 5x ~ 6x in the best cases

presence of strong Balmer, Paschen and Brackett emission lines points to the
optical and near-infrared spectra stemming from the irradiated chromosphere of
the optically thick and geometrically thin accretion disc. Most of these HI
features are still detected in emission in both hard states but are veiled by
the compact jets continuum. We also confirm the presence of a broad Hbeta
absorption feature, prominent in the soft state and shallower in the first hard
state, which we argue forms in the deep layers of the optically thick accretion
disc. However, this trough is absent in the second hard state, a likely
consequence of the formation of a geometrically thick extended envelope that
arises above the disc plane and eventually enshrouds the region where the Hbeta
absorption feature forms. We detect this envelope through the presence of a
broad Pabeta emission line, which is constant during the first hard state but
correlates with the underlying continuum during the second hard state, pointing
to changing physical properties. We consider that this behaviour may be
consistent with the launch of a thermally-driven accretion disc wind during the
second hard state.

systems (OLFM systems) a multiple-action collective choice model for societies.
In those societies three kind of actors are considered: opinion leaders that
can exert certain influence over the decision of other actors, followers that
can be convinced to modify their original decisions, and independent actors
that neither are influenced nor can influence; mediators are actors that both
are influenced and influence other actors. This is a generalization of the
opinion leader-follower systems (OLF systems) proposed by van den Brink R, et
al. (2011).
  The satisfaction score is defined on the set of actors. For each actor it
measures the number of society initial decisions in which the final collective
decision coincides with the one that the actor initially selected. We
generalize in OLFM systems some properties that the satisfaction score meets
for OLF systems. By using these properties, we provide an axiomatization of the
satisfaction score for the case in which followers maintain their own initial
decisions unless all their opinion leaders share an opposite inclination. This

coexistence of two types of Ce ions, namely trivalent Ce$^{3+}$ and
intermediate valent Ce$^{(4-\delta)+}$, in a metallic environment. The ordered
arrangement of these two Ce types on specific crystallographic sites results in
a doubling of the unit cell along the $c$-axis with respect to the basic
monoclinic CeCoAl-type structure. Below room temperature, structural modulation
transitions with very broad hysteresis have been reported from measurements of
various bulk properties. X-ray diffraction revealed that at low temperatures
the doubling of the CeCoAl type structure is replaced by a different modulated
ground state, approximating a near tripling of the basic CeCoAl cell. The
transition is accompanied by a significant contraction of the $c$ axis. We
present new x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy data at the Ce L$_{3}$
absorption edge, measured on a freshly cleaved surface of a CeRuSn single
crystal. In contrast to a previous report, the new data exhibit small but
significant variations as function of temperature that are consistent with a
transition of a fraction of Ce$^{3+}$ ions to the intermediate valence state,
analogous to the $\gamma \rightarrow \alpha$ transition in elemental cerium,
when cooling through the structural transitions of CeRuSn. Such results in a
valence-modulated state.

X-ray selected clusters of galaxies identified with the X-ray Telescope (XRT)
on board the Swift satellite down to a flux limit of ~10-14 erg/s/cm2 (SWXCS,
Tundo et al. 2012). We carry out a detailed X-ray spectral analysis with the
twofold aim of measuring redshifts and characterizing the properties of the
Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM). Optical counterparts and spectroscopic or
photometric redshifts are obtained with a cross-correlation with NED.
Additional photometric redshifts are computed with a dedicated follow-up
program with the TNG and a cross-correlation with the SDSS. We also detect the
iron emission lines in 35% of the sample, and hence obtain a robust measure of
the X-ray redshift zX. We use zX whenever the optical redshift is not
available. Finally, for all the sources with measured redshift,
background-subtracted spectra are fitted with a mekal model. We perform
extensive spectral simulations to derive an empirical formula to account for
fitting bias. The bias-corrected values are then used to investigate the
scaling properties of the X-ray observables. Overall, we are able to
characterize the ICM of 46 sources. The sample is mostly constituted by
clusters with temperatures between 3 and 10 keV, plus 14 low-mass clusters and
groups with temperatures below 3 keV. The redshift distribution peaks around
z~0.25 and extends up to z~1, with 60% of the sample at 0.1<z<0.4. We derive
the Luminosity-Temperature relation for these 46 sources, finding good
agreement with previous studies. The quality of the SWXCS sample is comparable
to other samples available in the literature and obtained with much larger
X-ray telescopes. Our results have interesting implications for the design of
future X-ray survey telescopes, characterised by good-quality PSF over the

displaying a pitchfork symmetry breaking bifurcation at the threshold of the
continuous spectrum; 3) a finite family of continuous branches of solitons

of elliptic Jacobian functions. Moreover we show that families of nonlinear

in the linearization as a signature of the occurrence of bifurcations of

a modified dispersion relation that becomes nonlinear at short wavelengths. The
motivations of this work arise on the one hand from the developing field of
analog gravity, where we aim at measuring the Hawking effect in fluid flows
that mimic black hole space-times, and on the other hand from the possibility
that quantum gravity effects might be approximately modeled by a modified
dispersion relation. We develop several studies on various aspects of the
problem. First we obtain precise characterizations about the deviations from
the Hawking result of black hole radiation, which are induced by dispersion.
Second, we study the emergence, both in white hole flows or for massive fields,
of a macroscopic standing wave, spontaneously produced from the Hawking effect,
and known as `undulation'. Third, we describe in detail an instability named
black hole laser, which arises in the presence of two horizons, where Hawking
radiation is self-amplified and induces an exponentially growing in time
emitted flux.

operation may be interpreted as a Gaussian convolution, that is a very

with an oceanographic 3D-Var data assimilation scheme, named OceanVar, where
the linear system is solved by using the Conjugate Gradient (GC) method by
replacing, at each step, the Gaussian convolution with RFs. Here we give
theoretical issues on the discrete convolution approximation with a first order

and obtain a Cahn--Hilliard type system, which is integrated numerically using
the finite element method. An adaptive concept using reliable, residual based
error estimation is exploited for the resolution of the spatial mesh.
  The overall concept is numerically investigated and comparison values are

determines properties of the process of adaptation. Several small genetic
fitness landscapes have recently been built by selecting a handful of
beneficial mutations and measuring fitness of all combinations of these
mutations. Here we generate several testable predictions for the properties of
these landscapes under Fisher's geometric model of adaptation (FGMA). When far
from the fitness optimum, we analytically compute the fitness effect of
beneficial mutations and their epistatic interactions. We show that epistasis
may be negative or positive on average depending on the distance of the
ancestral genotype to the optimum and whether mutations were independently
selected or co-selected in an adaptive walk. Using simulations, we show that
genetic landscapes built from FGMA are very close to an additive landscape when
the ancestral strain is far from the optimum. However, when close to the
optimum, a large diversity of landscape with substantial ruggedness and sign
epistasis emerged. Strikingly, landscapes built from different realizations of
stochastic adaptive walks in the same exact conditions were highly variable,
suggesting that several realizations of small genetic landscapes are needed to
gain information about the underlying architecture of the global adaptive

method, which is Abelian-like. When this latter relation is combined with the
standard gauge technique, supplemented by a crucial set of transverse Ward
identities, it allows the approximate determination of the nonperturbative

The light quark condensates in the hadronic matter are obtained from the values
of the non strange and strange scalar fields of the explicit chiral symmetry
breaking term in a chiral SU(3) model. The in-medium gluon condensate is
calculated through the medium modification of a scalar dilaton field, which is
introduced into the chiral SU(3) model to simulate the scale symmetry breaking
of QCD. The mass of the $\omega$ meson is observed to have initially a drop
with increase in density and then a rise due to the scattering with the
baryons. The mass of the $\rho$ meson is seen to drop with density due to
decrease of the light quark condensates in the medium. The effects of isospin
asymmetry and strangeness of the medium on the masses of the vector mesons are
also studied in the present work. The $\phi$ meson is observed to have marginal
drop in its mass in the nuclear medium. However, the strangeness of the medium

manipulate these edge state dynamically. We find that a fast RF change of the

fixed coupling, for which we obtain exact solutions valid for generic values of
the transverse momentum (above the medium saturation scale) and corresponding
to various initial conditions. In the case of a running coupling, we construct
approximate solutions in the form of truncated series obtained via successive
iterations, whose convergence is well under control. We thus deduce the
dominant asymptotic behavior of the renormalized $\hat q$ in the limit of a
large evolution time $Y\equiv\ln(L/\lambda)$, with $L$ the size of the medium
and $\lambda$ the typical wavelength of a medium constituent. We show that the
asymptotic expansion is universal with respect to the choice of the initial
condition at $Y=0$ and, moreover, it is remarkably similar to the corresponding
expansion for the saturation momentum of a shockwave (a large nucleus). As
expected, the running of the coupling significantly slows down the increase of
$\hat q$ with $Y$ in the asymptotic regime at $Y\gg 1$. For the
phenomenologically interesting value $Y\simeq 3$, we find an enhancement factor
close to 3, independently of the initial condition and for both fixed and

This is fine for singlet scalar DM, but not in the singlet fermion DM (SFDM) or

this correlation within UV completions of SFDM and VDM models with Higgs

at least two additional hidden parameter in $\sigma_p^{\rm SI}$ in the UV
completions: the singlet-like scalar mass $m_2$ and its mixing angle $\alpha$
with the SM Higgs boson ($h$). In particular, if the singlet-like scalar is
lighter than the SM Higgs boson ($m_2 < m_h \cos \alpha / \sqrt{1 + \cos^2
\alpha}$), the collider bound becomes weaker than the one based on EFT.

an important problem in the current data-driven era. Indeed, estimating the
shape dimension is often the first step in studying the processes or phenomena
associated to the data. Among the many dimension detection algorithms proposed
in various fields, a few can provide theoretical guarantee on the correctness
of the estimated dimension. However, the correctness usually requires certain
regularity of the input: the input points are either uniformly randomly sampled
in a statistical setting, or they form the so-called
$(\varepsilon,\delta)$-sample which can be neither too dense nor too sparse.
  Here, we propose a purely topological technique to detect dimensions. Our
algorithm is provably correct and works under a more relaxed sampling
condition: we do not require uniformity, and we also allow Hausdorff noise. Our
approach detects dimension by determining local homology. The computation of
this topological structure is much less sensitive to the local distribution of
points, which leads to the relaxation of the sampling conditions. Furthermore,
by leveraging various developments in computational topology, we show that this
local homology at a point $z$ can be computed \emph{exactly} for manifolds
using Vietoris-Rips complexes whose vertices are confined within a local
neighborhood of $z$. We implement our algorithm and demonstrate the accuracy
and robustness of our method using both synthetic and real data sets.

seem to be the most straight forward solution. The contextual bandit framework
was introduced for that very purpose. In general the evaluation of a RS is a
critical issue. Live evaluation is of- ten avoided due to the potential loss of
revenue, hence the need for offline evaluation methods. Two options are
available. Model based meth- ods are biased by nature and are thus difficult to

Evaluat- ing online learning algorithms with past data is not simple but some
methods exist in the litera- ture. Nonetheless their accuracy is not satisfac-

present a new method, based on bootstrapping techniques. This new method comes
with two important improve- ments: it is much more accurate and it provides a
measure of quality of its estimation. The latter is a highly desirable property
in order to minimize the risks entailed by putting online a RS for the first

defined by applying a Gaussian Mixture Bayesian Generative Method (GMM) on 636
pre-identified RRL stars instead of applying the commonly used rectangular
cuts. Specifically, our method selects 8,115 RRL candidates (heliocentric
distances < 70 kpc) using GMM color cuts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) and GMM variability cuts from the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid
Response System 1 3pi survey (PS1). Comparing our method with the Stripe 82
catalog of RRL stars shows that the efficiency and completeness levels of our
method are ~77% and ~52%, respectively. Most contaminants are either
non-variable main-sequence stars or stars in eclipsing systems. The method
described here efficiently recovers known stellar halo substructures. It is
expected that the current completeness and efficiency levels will further
improve with the additional PS1 epochs (~3 epochs per filter) that will be
observed before the conclusion of the survey. A comparison between our
efficiency and completeness levels using the GMM method to the efficiency and
completeness levels using rectangular cuts that are commonly used yielded a
significant increase in the efficiency level from ~13% to ~77% and an
insignificant change in the completeness levels. Hence, we favor using the GMM
technique in future studies. Although we develop it over the SDSS X PS1
footprint, the technique presented here would work well on any multi-band,
multi-epoch survey for which the number of epochs is limited.

set $A$ of some Euclidean space $\R^q$. We do not assume that the family

degenerate. Our aim is to give a BSDE representation, known as nonlinear
Feynman-Kac formula, for the value function associated to these control
problems. For this reason, we introduce a class of backward stochastic
differential equations with jumps and partially constrained diffusive part. We
look for the minimal solution to this family of BSDEs, for which we prove

most likely triggered by unstable ignition of carbon in a sea of heavy nuclei
made during the rp-process of regular type I X-ray bursts (where the
accumulated hydrogen and helium are burned). An open question is the origin of
sufficient amounts of carbon, which is largely destroyed during the rp-process
in X-ray bursts. We explore carbon production in steady-state burning via the
rp-process, which might occur together with unstable burning in systems showing
superbursts. We find that for a wide range of accretion rates and accreted
helium mass fractions large amounts of carbon are produced, even for systems
that accrete solar composition. This makes stable hydrogen and helium burning a
viable source of carbon to trigger superbursts. We also investigate the

indirect connections that exist between ray theory, wave theory and potential
scattering theory. Such connections have been noted in the past, and have been
exploited to some degree, but in the opinion of this author, there is much more
yet to be pursued in this regard. This article provides the framework for more
detailed analysis in the future. In order to gain a better appreciation for a
topic, it is frequently of value to examine it from as many complementary
levels of description as possible, and that is the objective here. Drawing in
part on the work of Nussenzveig, Lock, Debye and others, the mathematical
nature of the rainbow is discussed from several perspectives. The primary bow
is the lowest-order bow that can occur by scattering from a spherical drop with
constant refractive index n, but zero-order (or direct transmission) bows can
exist when the sphere is radially inhomogeneous. The refractive index profile
automatically defines a scattering potential, but with a significant difference
compared to the standard quantum mechanical form: the potential is k-dependent.
A consequence of this is that there are no bound states for this system. The
correspondences between the resonant modes in scattering by a potential of the
well-barrier type and the behavior of electromagnetic rays in a transparent (or
dielectric) sphere are discussed. The poles and saddle points of the associated
scattering matrix have quite profound connections to electromagnetic tunneling,
resonances and bows arising within and from the sphere. The links between the
various mathematical and physical viewpoints are most easily appreciated in the
case of constant n, thus providing insight into possible extensions to these
descriptions for bows of arbitrary order in radially inhomogeneous spheres (and
cylinders).

proposed as a way to relieve the current overload of cellular networks.
Opportunistic communication can occur when mobile device users are
(temporarily) in each other's proximity, such that the devices can establish a
local peer-to-peer connection (e.g., via Bluetooth). Since opportunistic
communication is based on the spontaneous mobility of the participants, it is
inherently unreliable. This poses a serious challenge to the design of any
cellular offloading solutions, that must meet the applications' requirements.
In this paper, we address this challenge from an optimization analysis
perspective, in contrast to the existing heuristic solutions. We first model
the dissemination of content (injected through the cellular interface) in an
opportunistic network with heterogeneous node mobility. Then, based on this
model, we derive the optimal content injection strategy, which minimizes the
load of the cellular network while meeting the applications' constraints.
Finally, we propose an adaptive algorithm based on control theory that
implements this optimal strategy without requiring any data on the mobility
patterns or the mobile nodes' contact rates. The proposed approach is
extensively evaluated with both a heterogeneous mobility model as well as
real-world contact traces, showing that it substantially outperforms previous
approaches proposed in the literature.

imprecise knowledge about the state of the system and the dynamics laws. Our
approach is based on Fuzzy Set Theory, and it will be shown that the
\emph{Fuzzy Dynamics} of a $n$-dimensional system is equivalent to Lagrangian
(or Hamiltonian) mechanics in a $n+1$-dimensional space. In some cases,
however, the corresponding Lagrangian is more general than the usual one and
could depend on the action. In this case, Lagrange's equations gain a non-zero
right side proportional to the derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the
action. Examples of such systems are unstable systems, systems with dissipation
and systems which can remember their history. Moreover, in certain situations,
the Lagrangian could be a set-valued function. The corresponding equations of
motion then become differential inclusions instead of differential equations.
We will also show that the principal of least action is a consequence of the
causality principle and the local topology of the state space and not an
independent axiom of classical mechanics.
  We emphasize that our adaptation of Lagrangian mechanics does not use or
depend on specific properties of the physical system being modeled. Therefore,
this Lagrangian approach may be equally applied to \emph{non-physical} systems.
An example of such an application is presented as well.

objects, an updated fit to the Lira relation is presented along with evidence
for a dependence on the late-time slope of the B-V color-curves with stretch
and color. Using the full wavelength range from u to H band, we place
constraints on the reddening law for the sample as a whole and also for
individual events/hosts based solely on the observed colors. The photometric
data continue to favor low values of Rv, though with large variations from
event to event, indicating an intrinsic distribution. We confirm the findings
of other groups that there appears to be a correlation between the derived
reddening law, Rv, and the color excess, E(B-V), such that larger E(B-V) tends
to favor lower Rv. The intrinsic u-band colors show a relatively large scatter
that cannot be explained by variations in Rv or by the Goobar (2008) power-law
for circumstellar dust, but rather is correlated with spectroscopic features of
the supernova and is therefore likely due to metallicity effects.

transonic solutions having different properties: each solution is mainly
produced by the dark matter halo and the super-massive black hole,
respectively. Furthermore, we apply our model to the Sombrero galaxy. In this
galaxy, Chandra X-ray observatory detected the diffuse hot gas as the trace of
galactic outflows while the star-formation rate is low and the observed gas
density distribution presumably indicates the hydrostatic equilibrium. To solve
this discrepancy, we propose a solution that this galaxy has a transonic
outflow, however, the transonic point forms in a very distant region from the
galactic center (?$\sim$ 127 kpc). In this slowly accelerated transonic
outflow, the outflow velocity is less than the sound velocity for most of the
galactic halo. Since the gas density distribution in this subsonic region is
similar to the hydrostatic one, it is difficult to distinguish the wide
subsonic region from hydrostatic state. Such galactic outflows are dfferent
from the conventional supersonic outflows observed in star-forming galaxies.
