mechanics of non-equilibrium processes may be used for the efficient
determination of high-dimensional integrals as typically occurring in Bayesian
data analysis. In particular for multimodal distributions, Monte-Carlo
procedures not relying on perfect equilibration are advantageous. We provide a
comprehensive statistical error analysis for the determination of the
prior-predictive value in a Bayes problem building on a variant of the
Jarzynski equation. Special care is devoted to the characterization of the bias
intrinsic to the method. We also discuss the determination of averages over
multimodal posterior distributions with the help of a variant of the Crooks
theorem. All our findings are verified by extensive numerical simulations of
two model systems with bimodal likelihoods.

Earth-like atmosphere and irradiation and present results for two
representative rotation periods of $P_{rot}$ = 10 days and $P_{rot}$ = 36.5

features for the rotating regime 3 < $P_{rot}$ < 100 days, which was shown by
Edson et al. (2011) to be an intermediate regime between equatorial
superrotation and divergence. We confirm that the $P_{rot}$ = 10 days case is
more dominated by equatorial superrotation dynamics than the $P_{rot}$ = 36.5
days case, which shows diminishing influence of standing Rossby- Kelvin waves
and increasing influence of divergence at the top of the atmosphere. We argue
that this dynamical regime change relates to the increase in Rossby deformation
radius, in agreement with previous studies. However, we also pay attention to
other features that are not or only in partial agreement with other studies,
like, e.g., the number of circulation cells and their strength, the role and

lot of attention in various research fields due to their exceptionally high
quality factors ($Q$s). Despite their popularity, the origin of the limiting
loss mechanisms in these structures has remained controversial. In this paper
we propose an analytical model combining acoustic radiation loss with intrinsic
loss. The model accurately predicts the resulting mode-dependent $Q$s of a
low-stress silicon-rich and a high-stress stoichiometric SiN membrane. The
large acoustic mismatch of the low-stress membrane to the substrate seems to
minimize radiation loss and $Q$s of higher modes ($n \wedge m \geq 3$) are
limited by intrinsic losses. The study of these intrinsic losses in low-stress
membranes with varying lengths $L$ and thicknesses $h$ reveals an inverse
linear dependence of the intrinsic loss with $h$ for thin resonators
independent of $L$. This finding was confirmed by comparing the intrinsic
dissipation of arbitrary (membranes, strings, and cantilevers) SiN resonators
extracted from literature, suggesting surface loss as ubiquitous damping
mechanism in thin SiN resonators with $Q_{surf} = \beta \cdot h$ and $\beta =
6\times10^{10} \pm4\times 10^{10}$~m$^{-1}$. Based on the intrinsic loss the
maximal achievable $Q$s and $Q\cdot f$ products for SiN membranes and strings
are outlined.

HD100546 is fascinating because of its variety of sub-structures possibly
related to forming planets in the disk, and PDI is currently the best technique
to image them in the near-IR. Our key results are: (1) For the first time ever,
we detect a disk in L-band PDI data. (2) We constrain the outer radius of the
inner hole to 14pm2 AU and its eccentricity to < 0.133. (3) We detect a dark
lane in the front side of the disk, which is likely an effect of the scattering
angle and the scattering function of the grains. (4) We find a spiral arm in
the northeast which has no obvious connection to spiral arms seen before by
other authors further out in the disk, but winds in the same direction
(clockwise). (5) The two bright scattering peaks along the semi-major axis are
asymmetric, with the southeastern one being significantly brighter. This could
be related to the inner companion candidate that is close to the brighter side
of the disk at the time of the observations. (6) The scattering color is close
to grey between H and Ks filter, but the scattering in L filter is
significantly weaker. (7) We measure the position angle of the disk to be

scattering function in the H and Ks filter between 35 and 130 deg at two

with a disk that is more strongly flared in the outer regions.

of finite local complexity (FLC) patterns. The abstract notion of a ""pattern""
is introduced, which may be seen as an analogue of the space group of
isometries preserving a tiling but where, instead, one considers partial
isometries preserving portions of it. These inverse semigroups of partial
transformations are the suitable analogue of the space group for patterns with
FLC but few global symmetries. In a similar vein we introduce the notion of a
\emph{collage}, a system of equivalence relations on the ambient space of a
pattern, which we show is capable of generalising many constructions applicable
to the study of FLC tilings and Delone sets, such as the expression of the
tiling space as an inverse limit of approximants.
  An invariant is constructed for our abstract patterns, the so called
pattern-equivariant (PE) homology. These homology groups are defined using
infinite singular chains on the ambient space of the pattern, although we show
that one may define cellular versions which are isomorphic under suitable
conditions. For FLC tilings these cellular PE chains are analogous to the PE
cellular cochains \cite{Sadun1}. The PE homology and cohomology groups are
shown to be related through Poincar\'{e} duality.
  An efficient and highly geometric method for the computation of the PE
homology groups for hierarchical tilings is presented. The rotationally
invariant PE homology groups are shown not to be a topological invariant for
the associated tiling space and seem to retain extra information about global
symmetries of tilings in the tiling space. We show how the PE homology groups
may be incorporated into a spectral sequence converging to the \v{C}ech
cohomology of the rigid hull of a tiling. These methods allow for a simple
computation of the \v{C}ech cohomology of the rigid hull of the Penrose
tilings.

compared to the inverse Fermi wave number $1/\kf$ of the gas. Through the
interactions with the Fermi gas the impurity gives birth to a quasi-particle,
which will be here a Fermi polaron (or more precisely a {\sl monomeron}). We
consider the general case of an impurity moving with wave vector $\KK\neq\OO$:
Then the quasi-particle acquires a finite lifetime in its initial momentum
channel because it can radiate particle-hole pairs in the Fermi sea. A
description of the system using a variational approach, based on a finite
number of particle-hole excitations of the Fermi sea, then becomes
inappropriate around $\KK=\mathbf{0}$. We rely thus upon perturbation theory,
where the small and negative parameter $\kf a\to0^-$ excludes any branches
other than the monomeronic one in the ground state (as e.g.\ the dimeronic
one), and allows us a systematic study of the system. We calculate the impurity
self-energy $\Sigma^{(2)}(\KK,\omega)$ up to second order included in $a$.
Remarkably, we obtain an analytical explicit expression for
$\Sigma^{(2)}(\KK,\omega)$ allowing us to study its derivatives in the plane
$(K,\omega)$. These present interesting singularities, which in general appear
in the third order derivatives $\partial^3 \Sigma^{(2)}(\KK,\omega)$. In the
special case of equal masses, $M=m$, singularities appear already in the
physically more accessible second order derivatives $\partial^2
\Sigma^{(2)}(\KK,\omega)$; using a self-consistent heuristic approach based on
$\Sigma^{(2)}$ we then regularise the divergence of the second order derivative

enhancement of the free-space radiative emission at 660 nm wavelength by
utilizing a cylindrical HM resonator with a radius of 54 nm and a height of 80
nm on top of an opaque silver-cladded substrate. We also show how the
free-space radiation enhancement factor depends on the dipole orientation and
the location of the emitter near the subwavelength resonator. Furthermore, we
calculate that an array of HM resonators with subwavelength spacings can
maintain most of the enhancement effect of a single resonator.

problem in towns and cities. To explore this risk, one has assessed the
potential levels of exposure by a climate-driven model for dengue risk
transmission in Brazil and records of its seasonal variation at the key sites.
Like the weather, it is unworkable to forecast the precise situation with
regard to dengue in Brazil in 2014. One can, however, make informed guesses on
the basis of averaged records of dengue in previous years. For the areas around
the World Cup stadiums, these records show that the main dengue season will
have passed before the World Cup is held in June and July. Unfortunately, the
risk remains, even this is low but not negliegible, during these months in the
Brazilian north and northeast. But, in fact, the risk of an outbreak of dengue
fever during the upcoming soccer World Cup in Brazil is not serious enough to
warrant a high alert in the host cities, according to a reliable early warning

$r$ in a class of recently proposed two-field no-scale inflationary models in
supergravity. We show that, in order to obtain correct predictions, it is
crucial to take into account the coupling between the curvature and the
isocurvature perturbations induced by the noncanonical form of the kinetic
terms. This coupling enhances the curvature perturbation and suppresses the
resulting tensor-to-scalar ratio to the per mille level even for values of the
slow-roll parameter $\epsilon \sim 0.01$. Beyond these particular models, we
emphasise that multifield models of inflation are a priori not predictive,
unless one supplies a prescription for the post-inflationary era, or an
adiabatic limit is reached before the end of inflation. We examine the
conditions that enabled us to actually derive predictions in the models under
study, by analysing the various contributions to the effective isocurvature
mass in general two-field inflationary models. In particular, we point out a
universal geometrical contribution that is important at the end of inflation,
and which can be directly extracted from the inflationary Lagrangian,
independently of a specific trajectory. Eventually, we point out that spectator
fields can lead to oscillatory features in the time-dependent power spectra at

non-instantaneous communication with bounded communication rate. Given a
prescribed rate of convergence, the proposed event-triggered control
implementations opportunistically determine the transmission instants and the
finite precision data to be transmitted on each transmission. We show that our
design exponentially practically stabilizes the origin while guaranteeing a
uniform positive lower bound on the inter-transmission and inter-reception
times, ensuring that the number of bits transmitted on each transmission is
upper bounded uniformly in time, and allowing for the possibility of
transmitting fewer bits at any given time if more bits than prescribed were
transmitted earlier. We also characterize the necessary and sufficient average
data rate for exponential practical stabilization. Several simulations

spectral image and a detection kernel representing a typical emission line

requiring the use of flat-field images to suppress noise around the mask
regions. Bad pixels on the detectors and pixels affected by cosmic-rays are
efficiently removed by using the information obtained from the FMOS analysis
pipeline. We limit the range of acceptable line-shape parameters for the
detected candidates to further improve the reliability of line detection. The
final performance of line detection is tested using a subset of the FastSound

inverted frames obtained by exchanging object and sky frames. The false

neutrino masses through gravitational weak lensing. Planned large galaxy
surveys such as the Large Synoptic Sky Telescope (LSST) and Euclid are expected
to measure the sum of neutrino masses to extremely high precision, sufficient
to detect non-zero neutrino masses even in the minimal mass normal hierarchy.
We show that weak lensing of galaxies while being a very good probe of neutrino
masses, is extremely sensitive to baryonic feedback processes. We use publicly
available results from the Overwhelmingly Large Simulations (OWLS) project to
investigate the effects of active galactic nuclei feedback, the nature of the
stellar initial mass function, and gas cooling rates, on the measured weak
lensing shear power spectrum. Using the Fisher matrix formalism and priors from
CMB+BAO data, we show that when one does not account for feedback, the measured
neutrino mass may be substantially larger or smaller than the true mass,
depending on the dominant feedback mechanism, with the mass error |\Delta m_nu|
often exceeding the mass m_nu itself. We also consider gravitational lensing of
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and show that it is not sensitive to
baryonic feedback on scales l < 2000, although CMB experiments that aim for
sensitivities sigma(m_nu) < 0.02 eV will need to include baryonic effects in
modeling the CMB lensing potential. A combination of CMB lensing and galaxy
lensing can help break the degeneracy between neutrino masses and baryonic
feedback processes. We conclude that future large galaxy lensing surveys such
as LSST and Euclid can only measure neutrino masses accurately if the matter
power spectrum can be measured to similar accuracy.

$9\times 10^{61}$ erg, $1.6\times 10^{8}$ yr, and $1.7\times 10^{46}$ erg/s,

surface brightness discontinuities associated with an elliptical shock front of
Mach number 1.26 (1.17-1.30) and age of $1.1\times 10^{8}$ yr. The shock has
injected at least $4\times 10^{61}$ erg into the hot atmosphere at a rate of
$1.1\times 10^{46}$ erg/s. A second pair of cavities and possibly a second

declined by a factor of 30 over the past 100 Myr. The multiphase atmosphere
surrounding the central galaxy is cooling at a rate of 36 Msun/yr, but does not
fuel star formation at an appreciable rate. In addition to heating, entrainment
in the radio jet may be depleting the nucleus of fuel and preventing gas from
condensing out of the intracluster medium. Finally, we examine the mean time

this adaptivity, the convex banding estimator enjoys theoretical optimality
properties not attained by previous banding or tapered estimators. In
particular, our convex banding estimator is minimax rate adaptive in Frobenius
and operator norms, up to log factors, over commonly-studied classes of
covariance matrices, and over more general classes. Furthermore, it correctly
recovers the bandwidth when the true covariance is exactly banded. Our convex
formulation admits a simple and efficient algorithm. Empirical studies
demonstrate its practical effectiveness and illustrate that our exactly-banded

intense study. Most research employs microresonators with anomalous dispersion,
for which modulation instability is believed to play a key role in initiation
of the comb. Comb generation in normal dispersion microresonators has also been
reported but is less well understood. Here we report a detailed investigation
of few-moded, normal dispersion silicon nitride microresonators, showing that
mode coupling can strongly modify the local dispersion, even changing its sign.
We demonstrate a link between mode coupling and initiation of comb generation
by showing experimentally, for the first time to our knowledge, pinning of one
of the initial comb sidebands near a mode crossing frequency. Associated with
this route to comb formation, we observe direct generation of coherent,
bandwidth-limited pulses at repetition rates down to 75 GHz, without the need

connected. It is ubiquitous in many networks but poses many modelling
challenges. Clustering typically manifests itself by a higher than expected
frequency of triangles, and this has led to the principle of constructing
networks from such building blocks. This approach has been generalised to
networks being constructed from a set of more exotic subgraphs. As long as
these are fully connected, it is then possible to derive mean-field models that
approximate epidemic dynamics well. However, there are virtually no results for
non-fully connected subgraphs. In this paper, we provide a general and
automated approach to deriving a set of ordinary differential equations, or
mean-field model, that describes, to a high degree of accuracy, the expected
values of system-level quantities, such as the prevalence of infection. Our
approach offers a previously unattainable degree of control over the
arrangement of subgraphs and network characteristics such as classical node
degree, variance and clustering. The combination of these features makes it
possible to generate families of networks with different subgraph compositions
while keeping classical network metrics constant. Using our approach, we show
that higher-order structure realised either through the introduction of loops
of different sizes or by generating clustered networks based on different
subgraphs, leads to significant differences in epidemic dynamics despite
controlling for basic network metrics.

of each polarimeter event is used to unfold the 120-kHz spin precession and
assign events to bins according to the direction of the horizontal
polarization. After accumulation for one or more seconds, the down-up
scattering asymmetry can be calculated for each direction and matched to a
sinusoidal function whose magnitude is proportional to the horizontal
polarization. This requires prior knowledge of the spin tune or polarization
precession rate. An initial estimate is refined by re-sorting the events as the
spin tune is adjusted across a narrow range and searching for the maximum
polarization magnitude. The result is biased toward polarization values that
are too large, in part because of statistical fluctuations but also because
sinusoidal fits to even random data will produce sizeable magnitudes when the
phase is left free to vary. An analysis procedure is described that matches the
time dependence of the horizontal polarization to templates based on
emittance-driven polarization loss while correcting for the positive bias. This
information will be used to study ways to extend the horizontal polarization
lifetime by correcting spin tune spread using ring sextupole fields and thereby
to support the feasibility of searching for an intrinsic electric dipole moment
using polarized beams in a storage ring. This paper is a combined effort of the

used. They are ideally suited to find the tilt and twist of a collection of
rings, which allow us to detect and measure the warp parameters. To test them,
we use random realizations of test particles which evolve in a realistic

some cases a twist is introduced additionally. The Gaia selection function, its
errors model and a realistic 3D extinction map are applied to mimic three
tracer populations: OB, A and Red Clump stars. We show how the use of
kinematics improves the accuracy in the recovery of the warp parameters. The OB

accuracy better than $\sim0.5$ up to Galactocentric distance of $\sim16$ kpc.
Using data with good astrometric quality, the same accuracy is obtained for A

normal-state quasiparticle contribution to the Nernst signal, Nqp, which is
subtracted from the total signal, N, to obtain the superconducting
contribution, Nsc. As a function of H, Nsc peaks at a field H* whose
temperature dependence obeys Hc2* ln(T/Tc), as it does in a conventional
superconductor like Nb1-xSix. The doping dependence of the characteristic field
scale Hc2* - shown to be closely related to the upper critical field Hc2 -
tracks the dome-like dependence of Tc, showing that superconductivity is
weakened below the quantum critical point where the Fermi surface is
reconstructed, presumably by the onset of antiferromagnetic order. Our data at
all dopings are quantitatively consistent with the theory of Gaussian
superconducting fluctuations, eliminating the need to invoke unusual
vortex-like excitations above Tc, and ruling out phase fluctuations as the
mechanism for the fall of Tc with underdoping. We compare the properties of

correspondences like the PnP 2D-3D pose problems. In this paper, we address the
problem of finding correspondences in the absence of unary or pairwise
constraints as it emerges in problems where unary appearance similarity like
SIFT matches is not available. Current higher order matching approaches have
targeted problems where higher order affinity can simply be formulated as a
difference of invariances such as lengths, angles, or cross-ratios. In this
paper, we present a method of how to apply geometric constraints modeled as
polynomial equation systems. As opposed to RANSAC where such systems have to be
solved and then tested for inlier hypotheses, our constraints are derived as a
single affinity weight based on $n>2$ hypothesized correspondences without
solving the polynomial system. Since the result is directly a correspondence
without a transformation model, our approach supports correspondence matching
in the presence of multiple geometric transforms like articulated motions.

This convenience, however, makes apps susceptible to the exposed component
vulnerability (ECV), in which a dangerous API (commonly known as sink) inside
its component can be triggered by other (malicious) apps. In the prior works,
detecting these ECVs use a set of sinks pertaining to the ECVs under detection.
In this paper, we argue that a more comprehensive and effective approach should
start by a systematic selection and classification of vulnerability-specific
sinks (VSinks). The set of VSinks is much larger than those used in the
previous works. Based on these VSinks, our sink-driven approach can detect
different kinds of ECVs in an app in two steps. First, VSinks and their
categories are identified through a typical forward reachability analysis.
Second, based on each VSink's category, a corresponding detection method is
used to identify the ECV via a customized backward dataflow analysis. We also
design a semi-auto guided analysis and validation capability for system-only
broadcast checking to remove some false positives. We implement our sink-driven
approach in a tool called ECVDetector and evaluate it with the top 1K Android
apps. Using ECVDetector we successfully identify a total of 49 vulnerable apps
across all four ECV categories we have defined. To our knowledge, most of them
are previously undisclosed, such as the very popular Go SMS Pro and Clean
Master. Moreover, the performance of ECVDetector is high, requiring only 9.257

thermal photons injected at high optical depth region are calculated until they
escape from the photosphere. It is found that presence of the lateral structure
within the jet leads to non-thermal feature of the spectra and significant
polarization signal in the resulting emission. The deviation from thermal
spectra as well as the polarization degree tends to be enhanced as the velocity
gradient in the shear region increases. In particular, we show that emissions
from multi-component jet can reproduce the typical observed spectra of
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) irrespective to the position of the observer when a

minimizes the probability of using the main base station for file delivery.
This problem is intractable in general. However, we show that the optimal

within the quasi-harmonic approximation, with the inclusion of phonon-phonon

phonon lifetimes and predict the lattice thermal conductivity. The results are
critically compared against experimental data and other calculations, and add
new insight to on-going research on the PbX compounds in relation to the
off-centring of Pb at high temperatures, which is shown to be related to phonon
softening. The agreement with experiment suggests that this method could serve
as a straightforward, powerful and generally-applicable means of investigating

space projects $Kepler$ and $CoRoT$ give us a great opportunity to successfully
detect such oscillations in numerous targets. Achievements of asteroseismology
depend on new discoveries of connections between the oscillation frequencies
and stellar properties. In the previous studies, the frequency of the maximum
amplitude and the large separation between frequencies were used for this
purpose. In the present study, we confirm that the large separation between the
frequencies has two minima at two different frequency values. These are the
signatures of the He {\small II} ionization zone, and as such have very strong
diagnostic potential. We relate these minima to fundamental stellar properties
such as mass, radius, luminosity, age and mass of convective zone. For mass,
the relation is simply based on the ratio of the frequency of minimum $\Delta
\nu$ to the frequency of maximum amplitude. These frequency comparisons can be
very precisely computed, and thus the mass and radius of a solar-like
oscillating star can be determined to high precision. We also develop a new
asteroseismic diagram which predicts structural and evolutionary properties of
stars with such data. We derive expressions for mass, radius, effective
temperature, luminosity and age in terms of purely asteroseismic quantities.
For solar-like oscillating stars, we now will have five very important
asteroseismic tools (two frequencies of minimum $\Delta \nu$, the frequency of
maximum amplitude, and the large and small separations between the oscillation
frequencies) to decipher properties of stellar interior astrophysics.

  Deviations and Optimality","A shorter version appeared in the proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM 2012",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a server serving a time-slotted queued system of multiple
packet-based flows, with exogenous packet arrivals and time-varying service
rates. At each time, the server can observe instantaneous service rates for
only a subset of flows (from within a fixed collection of observable subsets)
before scheduling a flow in the subset for service. We are interested in
queue-length aware scheduling to keep the queues short, and develop scheduling
algorithms that use only partial service rate information from subsets of
channels to minimize the likelihood of queue overflow in the system.
Specifically, we present a new joint subset-sampling and scheduling algorithm
called Max-Exp that uses only the current queue lengths to pick a subset of
flows, and subsequently schedules a flow using the Exponential rule. When the
collection of observable subsets is disjoint, we show that Max-Exp achieves the
best exponential decay rate, among all scheduling algorithms using partial
information, of the tail of the longest queue in the system. Towards this, we
employ novel analytical techniques for studying the performance of scheduling
algorithms using partial state, which may be of independent interest. These
include new sample-path large deviations results for processes obtained by
non-random, predictable sampling of sequences of independent and identically
distributed random variables. A consequence of these results is that scheduling
with partial state information yields a rate function significantly different
from scheduling with full channel information. In the special case when the
observable subsets are singleton flows, i.e., when there is effectively no a
priori channel-state information, Max-Exp reduces to simply serving the flow
with the longest queue; thus, our results show that to always serve the longest
queue in the absence of any channel-state information is large-deviations
optimal.

differently pinned Fermi level: at Ga broken bond state for dominantly bare
surface (region I), at VBM for NH2 and H covered (region II), and at CBM for
NH3 covered surface (region III). The extensive ab intio calculations show
validity of electron counting rule (ECR) for all mixed coverage, for bordering
these three regions. The adsorption was analyzed using newly identified
dependence of the adsorption energy on the charge transfer at the surface. For
region I and II ammonia adsorb dissociatively, disintegrating into H adatom and
HN2 radical for large fraction of vacant sites while for high coverage the
ammonia adsorption is molecular. The dissociative adsorption energy strongly
depends on the Fermi level at the surface (pinned) and in the bulk (unpinned)
while the molecular adsorption energy is determined by bonding to surface only,
in accordance to the recently published theory. The molecular adsorption is
determined by the energy of covalent bonding to the surface. Ammonia adsorption
in region III (Fermi level pinned at CBM) leads to unstable configuration both
molecular and dissociative which is explained by the fact that Ga-broken bond
sites are doubly occupied by electrons. The adsorbing ammonia brings 8
electrons to the surface, necessitating transfer of the electrons from
Ga-broken bond state to Fermi level, energetically costly process. Adsorption
of ammonia at H-covered site leads to creation of NH2 radical at the surface
and escape of H2 molecule. The process energy is close to 0.12 eV, thus not
large, but the inverse process is not possible due to escape of the hydrogen
molecule.

a power series in $Q_s^2/k_\perp^2$, in which the collinear factorization
result corresponds to the leading term. At high transverse momentum, the
subleading correction terms are insignficant, whereas at low $p_\perp$, the
power corrections become important and the small-x resummation is essential to
describe the differential cross section. We show that the familiar collinear

particularly important because this standing wave can ""inject"" electrons into
the reflected laser pulse where the electrons are further accelerated. We
identify two regimes of standing wave acceleration: a highly relativistic case
($a_0~\geq~1$), and a moderately relativistic case ($a_0~\sim~0.5$) which
operates over a larger fraction of the laser period. In previous studies, other
groups have investigated the highly relativistic case for its usefulness in
launching electrons in the forward direction. We extend this by investigating
electron acceleration in the {\it specular (back reflection) direction} and
over a wide range of intensities ($10^{17}-10^{19}$ W cm$^{-2}$).
