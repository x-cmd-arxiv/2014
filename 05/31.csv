films of the prototypical ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ is affected by the clamping
to the substrate and by substrate-induced misfit strain. We use molecular
dynamics simulations and a first-principles-based effective Hamiltonian to
calculate the adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T$ under different epitaxial
constraints. Our results demonstrate that, consistent with phenomenological
theory, clamping by the substrate reduces the maximum $\Delta T$ compared to
bulk BaTiO$_3$. On the other hand, compressive misfit-strain leads to a strong
increase of $\Delta T$ and shifts the maximum of the electrocaloric effect to
higher temperatures. A rather small compressive strain of $-0.75$% is
sufficient to obtain a $\Delta T$ that is larger than the corresponding bulk
value.

  simulations",,"Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2013, 15, 13628","10.1039/c3cp52198b",,"q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We determine potentials of the mean force for interactions of amino acids
with four common surfaces of ZnO in aqueous solutions. The method involves
all-atom molecular dynamics simulations combined with the umbrella sampling
technique. The profiled nature of the density of water with the strongly
adsorbed first layer affects the approach of amino acids to the surface and
generates either repulsion or weak binding. The largest binding energy is found
for tyrosine interacting with the surface in which the Zn ions are at the top.
It is equal to 7 kJ/mol which is comparable to that of the hydrogen bonds in a
protein. This makes the adsorption of amino acids onto the ZnO surface much
weaker than onto the well studied surface of gold. Under vacuum, binding
energies are more than 40 times stronger (for one of the surfaces). The precise
manner in which water molecules interact with a given surface influences the
binding energies in a way that depends on the surface. Among the four
considered surfaces the one with Zn at the top is recognized as binding almost
all amino acids with an average binding energy of 2.60 kJ/mol. Another (O at
the top) is non-binding for most amino acids. For binding situations the
average energy is 0.66 kJ/mol. The remaining two surfaces bind nearly as many
amino acids as they do not and the average binding energies are 1.46 and 1.22
kJ/mol. For all of the surfaces the binding energies vary between amino acids
significantly: the dispersion in the range of 68-154% of the mean. A small
protein is shown to adsorb onto ZnO only intermittently and with only a small
deformation. Various adsorption events lead to different patterns in mobilities
of amino acids within the protein.

importance, since this optimization problem arises in many engineering and
computer science applications. Especially the Earth Mover's Distance is used in
a plethora of applications ranging from content-based image retrieval, shape
matching, fingerprint recognition, object tracking and phishing web page
detection to computing color differences in linguistics and biology. Our
starting point is the well-known revised simplex algorithm, which iteratively
improves a feasible solution to optimality. The Shortlist Method that we
propose substantially reduces the number of candidates inspected for improving
the solution, while at the same time balancing the number of pivots required.
Tests on simulated benchmarks demonstrate a considerable reduction in
computation time for the new method as compared to the usual revised simplex
algorithm implemented with state-of-the-art initialization and pivot
strategies. As a consequence, the Shortlist Method facilitates the computation
of large scale transportation problems in viable time. In addition we describe
a novel method for finding an initial feasible solution which we coin Modified
Russell's Method.

gravitational waves from unknown spinning neutron stars in binary systems using
LIGO and Virgo data. Using a specially developed analysis program, the TwoSpect

and the second and third Virgo Science Runs. The search covers a range of
frequencies from 20 Hz to 520 Hz, a range of orbital periods from 2 to ~2,254 h
and a frequency- and period-dependent range of frequency modulation depths from
0.277 to 100 mHz. This corresponds to a range of projected semi-major axes of
the orbit from ~0.6e-3 ls to ~6,500 ls assuming the orbit of the binary is
circular. While no plausible candidate gravitational wave events survive the
pipeline, upper limits are set on the analyzed data. The most sensitive 95%
confidence upper limit obtained on gravitational wave strain is 2.3e-24 at 217
Hz, assuming the source waves are circularly polarized. Although this search
has been optimized for circular binary orbits, the upper limits obtained remain
valid for orbital eccentricities as large as 0.9. In addition, upper limits are

oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) on a catalyst surface, is widely used to
study properties of nonequilibrium phase transitions. In particular, it
exhibits a nonequilibrium, discontinuous transition between a reactive and a CO
poisoned phase. If one allows a nonzero rate of CO desorption ($k$), the line
of phase transitions terminates at a critical point ($k_{c}$). In this work,
instead of restricting the CO and atomic oxygen (O) to react to form carbon
dioxide (CO$_{2}$) only when they are adsorbed in close proximity, we consider
a modified model that includes an adjustable probability for adsorbed CO and O
atoms located far apart on the lattice to react. We employ large-scale Monte
Carlo simulations for system sizes up to 240$\times$240 lattice sites, using
the crossing of fourth-order cumulants to study the critical properties of this
system. We find that the nonequilibrium critical point changes from the
two-dimensional Ising universality class to the mean-field universality class
upon introducing even a weak long-range reactivity mechanism. This conclusion
is supported by measurements of cumulant fixed-point values, cluster
percolation probabilities, correlation-length finite-size scaling properties,
and the critical exponent ratio $\beta / \nu$. The observed behavior is
consistent with that of the \emph{equilibrium} Ising ferromagnet with
additional weak long-range interactions [T. Nakada, P. A. Rikvold, T. Mori, M.
Nishino, and S. Miyashita, Phys. Rev. B 84, 054433 (2011)]. The large system
sizes and the use of fourth-order cumulants also enable determination with
improved accuracy of the critical point of the original ZGB model with CO

of self-locating uncertainty: in the period between the wave function branching
via decoherence and an observer registering the outcome of the measurement,
that observer can know the state of the universe precisely without knowing
which branch they are on. We show that there is a uniquely rational way to
apportion credence in such cases, which leads directly to the Born Rule. Our

Turney","Semantic Composition and Decomposition: From Recognition to Generation","National Research Council Canada - Technical Report",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semantic composition is the task of understanding the meaning of text by
composing the meanings of the individual words in the text. Semantic
decomposition is the task of understanding the meaning of an individual word by
decomposing it into various aspects (factors, constituents, components) that
are latent in the meaning of the word. We take a distributional approach to
semantics, in which a word is represented by a context vector. Much recent work
has considered the problem of recognizing compositions and decompositions, but
we tackle the more difficult generation problem. For simplicity, we focus on
noun-modifier bigrams and noun unigrams. A test for semantic composition is,
given context vectors for the noun and modifier in a noun-modifier bigram (""red
salmon""), generate a noun unigram that is synonymous with the given bigram
(""sockeye""). A test for semantic decomposition is, given a context vector for a
noun unigram (""snifter""), generate a noun-modifier bigram that is synonymous
with the given unigram (""brandy glass""). With a vocabulary of about 73,000
unigrams from WordNet, there are 73,000 candidate unigram compositions for a
bigram and 5,300,000,000 (73,000 squared) candidate bigram decompositions for a
unigram. We generate ranked lists of potential solutions in two passes. A fast
unsupervised learning algorithm generates an initial list of candidates and
then a slower supervised learning algorithm refines the list. We evaluate the
candidate solutions by comparing them to WordNet synonym sets. For
decomposition (unigram to bigram), the top 100 most highly ranked bigrams
include a WordNet synonym of the given unigram 50.7% of the time. For
composition (bigram to unigram), the top 100 most highly ranked unigrams
include a WordNet synonym of the given bigram 77.8% of the time.

lattice, obtained by applying round-off to planar rotations. All orbits of
these maps are conjectured to be periodic. We let the angle of rotation
approach pi/2, and show that the limit of vanishing discretisation is described
by an integrable piecewise-affine Hamiltonian flow, whereby the plane foliates
into families of invariant polygons with an increasing number of sides.
  Considered as perturbations of the flow, the lattice maps assume a different
character, described in terms of strip maps: a variant of those found in outer
billiards of polygons. Furthermore, the flow is nonlinear (unlike the original
rotation), and a suitably chosen Poincare return map satisfies a twist
condition.
  The round-off perturbation introduces KAM-type phenomena: we identify the
unperturbed curves which survive the perturbation, and show that they form a
set of positive density in the phase space. We prove this considering symmetric
orbits, under a condition that allows us to obtain explicit values for
densities.
  Finally, we show that the motion at infinity is a dichotomy: there is one
regime in which the nonlinearity tends to zero, leaving only the perturbation,
and a second where the nonlinearity dominates. In the domains where the
nonlinearity remains, numerical evidence suggests that the distribution of the
periods of orbits is consistent with that of random dynamics, whereas in the
absence of nonlinearity, the fluctuations result in intricate discrete resonant

predicts that the optimal level of classical noise is reciprocally related to
the linear dimension of the lattice; our numerical simulations verify this
prediction to high accuracy for regular 1D and 2D networks over a range of

dramatic further improvements in performance occur when a driving field targets

silicon anode particle in a lithium ion battery as it undergoes lithiation is
presented. The two-way coupling between stress and concentration of lithium in
silicon, including the possibility of plastic deformation, is taken into
account and two particular cases are considered. First, the cylindrical
particle is assumed to be free of surface traction and second, the axial
deformation of the cylinder is prevented. In both cases plastic stretches
develop through the entire cylinder and not just near the surface as is
commonly found in spherical anode particles. It is shown that the stress
evolution depends both on the lithiation rate and the external constraints.
Furthermore, as the cylinder expands during lithiation it can develop a
compressive axial stress large enough to induce buckling, which in turn may
lead to mechanical failure. An explicit criterion for swelling-induced buckling
obtained as a modification of the classical Euler buckling criterion shows the
competition between the stabilising effect of radius increase and the
destabilising effect of axial stress.

different patterns in the density and polarization of water. The covalent bond
with the sulfur atom on cysteine is modeled by the Morse potential. We
demonstrate that binding energies of dipeptides are different than the combined
binding energies of their amino-acidic components. For the hydrophobic gold,
adsorption events of a small protein are driven by attraction to the strongest
binding amino acids. This is not so in the hydrophilic cases - a result of
smaller specificities combined with the difficulty for proteins, but not for
single amino acids, to penetrate the first layer of water. The properties of
water near the surface sensitively depend on the force field.

different neutrino scenarios we give upper bounds for the couplings of the

however, not so the intervening possibilities. Here we study the atomic limit

the single-particle density of states. We show that the combination of
nearest-neighbor interactions and site disorder produce a zero-bias anomaly
caused by residual charge ordering, and the addition of on-site interactions
has a non-monotonic effect on the depth of this zero-bias anomaly. A key
conclusion is that the form of the density of states in this classical system
strongly resembles density of states results obtained for the full extended

fragmentation of cylinders. Several sources show multiple filaments that
converge toward a center, where the velocity field in the filaments is
consistent with gas flows. We derive rotational temperature maps for the entire

distribution that is best fitted by power-law indices from $-$0.18 to $-$0.35.

axisymmetric, $f$-plane models of the tropical cyclone boundary layer. In the
numerical model, the boundary layer radial and tangential flow is forced by a
specified pressure field, which can also be interpreted as a specified gradient
balanced tangential wind field $v_{\rm gr}(r)$ or vorticity field $\zeta_{\rm
gr}(r)$. When the specified $\zeta_{\rm gr}(r)$ field is changed from one that
is radially concentrated in the inner core to one that is radially spread, the
quasi-steady-state boundary layer flow transitions from a single eyewall
shock-like structure to a double eyewall shock-like structure. To better
understand these structures, analytical solutions are presented for two
simplified versions of the model. In the simplified analytical models, which do
not include horizontal diffusion, the $u(\partial u/\partial r)$ term in the
radial equation of motion and the $u[f+(\partial v/\partial r)+(v/r)]$ term in
the tangential equation of motion produce discontinuities in the radial and
tangential wind, with associated singularities in the boundary layer pumping
and the boundary layer vorticity. In the numerical model, which does include
horizontal diffusion, the radial and tangential wind structures are not true
discontinuities, but are shock-like, with wind changes of 20 or 30 m s$^{-1}$
over a radial distance of a few kilometers. When double shocks form, the outer
shock can control the strength of the inner shock, an effect that likely plays
an important role in concentric eyewall cycles.

assessors are many or heterogeneous, we propose a mixture model for clustering
them in homogeneous subgroups, with cluster-specific consensus rankings. We
develop approximate stochastic algorithms that allow a fully probabilistic

prescription for working with potentially singular cuts is modified to cope
with an ambiguity that was not encountered before. The resulting methods are
then applied to three light-cone gauge string theories; i) $AdS_3 \times S^3

one-loop semiclassical computations. This agreement crucially includes the
rational terms and hence supports the conjecture that S-matrices of integrable
field theories are cut-constructible, up to a possible shift in the coupling.

the irreversible adsorption of patchy colloids on a substrate. We consider
spherical three-patch colloids and study the dependence of the kinetics on the
opening angle between patches. We show that growth is suppressed below and
above minimum and maximum opening angles, revealing two absorbing phase
transitions between thick and thin film regimes. While the transition at the
minimum angle is continuous, in the Directed Percolation class, that at the
maximum angle is clearly discontinuous. For intermediate values of the opening
angle, a rough colloidal network in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class
grows indefinitely. The nature of the transitions was analyzed in detail by
considering bond flexibility, defined as the dispersion of the angle between
the bond and the center of the patch. For the range of flexibilities considered
we always observe two phase transitions. However, the range of opening angles
where growth is sustained increases with flexibility. At a tricritical
flexibility, the discontinuous transition becomes continuous. The practical
implications of our findings and the relation to other nonequilibrium
transitions are discussed.

naturally occur in a warm region. In this scenario, radiation is produced
during the inflation epoch and reheating is avoided. The main question arises
that what is the origin of warm inflation in 4D universe? We answer to this
question in brane-antibrane system. We propose a model that allows all
cosmological parameters like the scale factor a, the Hubble parameter H and
phantom energy density depend on the equation of state parameter in transverse
dimension between two branes. Thus, an enhancement in these parameters can be a
signature of some evolutions in extra dimension. In our model, the expansion of
4D universe is controlled by the separation distance between branes and evolves
from non-phantom phase to phantom one. Consequently, phantom-dominated era of
the universe accelerates and ends up in big-rip singularity. Also, we show that
as the tachyon potential increases, the effect of interaction between branes on
the 4D universe expansion becomes systematically more effective, because at
higher energies there exists more channels for flowing energy from extra
dimension to other four dimensions. Finally, we test our model against WMAP and
Planck data and obtain the ripping time. According to experimental data,
$N\simeq 50$ case leads to $n_{s}\simeq 0.96$, where \emph{N} and $n_{s}$ are
the number e-folds and the spectral index respectively. This standard case may
be found in $0.01 < R_{Tensor-scalar } < 0.22$, where $R_{Tensor-scalar }$ is
the tensor-scalar ratio. At this point, the finite time that Big Rip
singularity occurs is $t_{rip}=33(Gyr)$.

enables different data management strategies and data I/O implementations,

only on WISE data to select asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with
circumstellar dust shells, and separate them into O-rich and C-rich classes.
With these criteria we produce an all-sky map for the count ratio of the two

gradient in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) disc. We find that the C:O number

twice as fast as measured for near-IR selected samples of early AGB stars.
Detailed radiative transfer models show that WISE colours are well explained by
the emission of centrally heated dusty shells where the dust has standard
properties of interstellar medium (ISM) grains. The segregation of different
classes of objects in WISE colour space arises from differences in properties
of the dust shells: those around young stellar objects have uniform density

the coupling between the injected energy and the interstellar medium (ISM).
Here, we model and quantify the impact of long-range AGN ionizing radiation --
in addition to the often considered small-scale energy deposition -- on the
physical state of the multi-phase ISM of the host-galaxy, and on its total Star
Formation Rate (SFR). We formulate an AGN Spectral Energy Distribution matched
with observations, which we use with the radiative transfer (RT) code Cloudy to
compute AGN ionization in a simulated high-redshift disk galaxy. We use a
high-resolution ($\sim6$ pc) simulation including standard thermal AGN feedback
and calculate RT in post-processing. Surprisingly, while these models produce
significant AGN-driven outflows, we find that AGN ionizing radiation and
heating reduce the SFR by a few percent at most for a quasar luminosity
($L_{bol}=10^{46.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$). Although the circum-galactic gaseous halo
can be kept almost entirely ionized by the AGN, most star-forming clouds
($n\gtrsim10^{2-3}$ cm$^{-3}$) and even the reservoirs of cool atomic gas
($n\sim0.3-10$ cm$^{-3}$) -- which are the sites of future star formation (100
- 200 Myrs), are generally too dense to be significantly affected. Our analysis
ignores any absorption from a putative torus, making our results upper limits
on the effects of ionizing radiation. Therefore, while the AGN-driven outflows
can remove substantial amounts of gas in the long term, the impact of AGN
feedback on the star formation efficiency in the interstellar gas in
high-redshift galaxies is marginal, even when long-range radiative effects are
accounted for.

find that the PPM detects the cluster candidates up to z=1.5, and it correctly

spherically symmetric clusters of different size and richness, and we locate
them at different redshifts (i.e. z = 1.0,1.5, and 2.0) in the COSMOS field. We
find that the PPM detects the simulated clusters within the considered redshift

placing C1-23152 at a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{spec}$=3.351. The modeling
of the emission-line corrected spectral energy distribution results in a
best-fit stellar mass of $M_{*}=3.1^{+0.6}_{-0.7}\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$, a
star-formation rate of <7 $M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$, and negligible dust extinction.
The stars appear to have formed in a short intense burst ~300-500 Myr prior to
the observation epoch, setting the formation redshift of this galaxy at z~4.1.
From the analysis of the line ratios and widths, and the observed flux at
24$\mu$m, we confirm the presence of a luminous hidden active galactic nucleus
(AGN), with bolometric luminosity of ~$10^{46}erg s^{-1}$. Potential
contamination to the observed SED from the AGN continuum is constrained,
placing a lower limit on the stellar mass of $2\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$.

frequency patterns of stellar oscillation modes. For stars like the Sun this is
relatively easy because the mode frequencies follow a regular pattern described
by a well-founded asymptotic relation. When a solar like star evolves off the
main sequence and onto the red giant branch its structure changes dramatically
resulting in changes in the frequency pattern of the modes. We follow the
evolution of the adiabatic frequency pattern from the main sequence to near the
tip of the red giant branch for a series of models. We find a significant
departure from the asymptotic relation for the non-radial modes near the red
giant branch tip, resulting in a triplet frequency pattern. To support our
investigation we analyze almost four years of Kepler data of the most luminous
stars in the field (late K and early M type) and find that their frequency
spectra indeed show a triplet pattern dominated by dipole modes even for the
most luminous stars in our sample. Our identification explains previous results
from ground-based observations reporting fine structure in the Petersen diagram
and sub ridges in the period-luminosity diagram. Finally, we find `new ridges'
of non-radial modes with frequencies below the fundamental mode in our model
calculations, and we speculate they are related to f modes.

of the ISM in rotating galaxies is very similar to that of the stars, with a
consequent negligible heating contribution from thermalization of the ordered
motions. The relative importance of flattening and rotation in determining the
final X-ray luminosity $L_x$ and temperature $T_x$ of the hot haloes is a
function of the galactic mass. Flattening and rotation in low mass galaxies
favour the establishment of global winds, with the consequent reduction of
$L_x$. In medium-to-high mass galaxies, flattening and rotation are not
sufficient to induce global winds, however, in the rotating models the nature

primordial non-Gaussianity, ruling out early-Universe models of inflation that
generate large non-Gaussianity. Although small improvements in the CMB
constraints are expected, the next frontier of precision will come from future
large-scale surveys of the galaxy distribution. The advantage of such surveys
is that they can measure many more modes than the CMB -- in particular,
forthcoming radio surveys with the SKA will cover huge volumes. Radio continuum
surveys deliver the largest volumes, but with the disadvantage of no redshift
information. In order to mitigate this, we use two additional observables.
First, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect -- the cross-correlation of the radio
number counts with the CMB temperature anisotropies -- helps to reduce
systematics on the large scales that are sensitive to non-Gaussianity. Second,
optical data allows for cross-identification in order to gain some redshift
information. We show that, while the single redshift bin case can provide a
sigma(fNL) ~ 20, and is therefore not competitive with current and future
constraints on non-Gaussianity, a tomographic analysis could improve the
constraints by an order of magnitude, even with only two redshift bins. A huge
improvement is provided by the addition of high-redshift sources, so having
cross-ID for high-z galaxies and an even higher-z radio tail is key to enabling
very precise measurements of fNL. Our results show that SKA continuum surveys
could provide constraints competitive with CMB and forthcoming optical surveys,
potentially allowing a measurement of sigma(fNL) ~ 1 to be made. Moreover,
these measurements would act as a useful check of results obtained with other
probes at other redshift ranges with other methods.

inflation is so low that it is comparable to, or lower than, the freeze out
temperature of ordinary WIMPs. In this case the dark matter relic abundance is
reduced, thus relaxing the impact of the usually strong constraint coming from
the requirement that the universe does not overclose. We first re-examine the
dynamics of freezeout during reheating. Next we apply a Bayesian approach to
study the parameter space of the MSSM with ten free parameters, the CMSSM and
the singlino-dominated regions of the NMSSM. In each case we find dramatic
departures from the usually considered regime of high $T_R$, with important
implications for direct detection dark matter searches. In the MSSM we examine
WIMP mass range up to ~5 TeV, and find regions of bino dark matter over the
whole mass range, and of higgsino dark matter with mass over a similar range
but starting from the ~1 TeV value of the standard high $T_R$ scenario. We show
that the prospects for bino detection strongly depend on $T_R$, while the
higgsino is for the most part detectable by future one-tonne detectors. The
wino, which is excluded in the standard scenario, becomes allowed again if its
mass is roughly above 3.5 TeV, and can be detectable. In the CMSSM, the bino
and higgsino mass ranges become more constrained although detection prospects
remain similar. In the Next-to-MSSM at low enough $T_R$ wide ranges of
singlino-dominated parameter space of the model become cosmologically allowed.
We also study the contribution to the DM relic density from direct and cascade
decays of the inflaton. Finally, we consider the case of a gravitino as dark
matter. We find strong bounds from overclosure and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis,
and derive lower limits on $T_R$ which depend on the gravitino mass and on the
nature of the lightest ordinary superpartner.

infinity before the width of the slit is considered to become large, to the
opposite situation where the order of the limits are swapped, known as the
half-plane limit when one polymer is modelled. In contrast with the single

We understand this result in part due to the tethering of polymers on both

  We also analyse the entropic force exerted by the polymers on the walls of
the slit. Again the results differ significantly from single polymer models. In
a single polymer system both attractive and repulsive regimes were seen,

parameter values. This variation can be explained by the adsorption of the

the molecular cross effects known in irreversible thermodynamics. In a fully

for signals observed from quantized random projections. Those signal estimation
techniques guarantee a perfect matching between the available quantized data
and a new observation of the estimated signal under the same sensing model.
Focusing on dithered uniform scalar quantization of resolution $\delta>0$, we
prove first that, given a Gaussian random frame of $\mathbb R^N$ with $M$
vectors, the worst-case $\ell_2$-error of consistent signal reconstruction
decays with high probability as $O(\frac{N}{M}\log\frac{M}{\sqrt N})$ uniformly
for all signals of the unit ball $\mathbb B^N \subset \mathbb R^N$. Up to a log
factor, this matches a known lower bound in $\Omega(N/M)$ and former empirical
validations in $O(N/M)$. Equivalently, if $M$ exceeds a minimal number of frame
coefficients growing like $O(\frac{N}{\epsilon_0}\log \frac{\sqrt
  N}{\epsilon_0})$, any vectors in $\mathbb B^N$ with $M$ identical quantized
projections are at most $\epsilon_0$ apart with high probability. Second, in
the context of Quantized Compressed Sensing with $M$ Gaussian random
measurements and under the same scalar quantization scheme, consistent
reconstructions of $K$-sparse signals of $\mathbb R^N$ have a worst-case error
that decreases with high probability as $O(\tfrac{K}{M}\log\tfrac{MN}{\sqrt
K^3})$ uniformly for all such signals. Finally, we show that the proximity of
vectors whose quantized random projections are only approximately consistent
can still be bounded with high probability. A certain level of corruption is
thus allowed in the quantization process, up to the appearance of a systematic
bias in the reconstruction error of (almost) consistent signal estimates.

fluctuations in the energy. This not only reduces the barrier to nucleation but
also suggests a change in the thermal radiation spectrum from such a mixture

zero, just as in a metal and in contrast to the behavior of all known

kappa/T with field reveals that the electron-electron scattering (or transport
mass m^*) of those unpaired electrons diverges as H approaches Hc2 from below,
in the same way that it does in the normal state as H approaches Hc2 from
above. This shows that the unpaired electrons sense the proximity of the
field-tuned quantum critical point of CeCoIn5 at H^* = Hc2 even from inside the
superconducting state. The fact that the quantum critical scattering of the
unpaired electrons is much weaker than the average scattering of all electrons

employ entropic quantifiers, while correlation functions are the second pair.
Their competition allows considering a wider spectrum of morphological
features. Instead of a standard random initial configuration, a synthetic one
with the same number of islands as that of the target is created by a cellular
automaton. This is the key point for speeding-up of microstructure
reconstruction, making use of the simulated annealing technique. The program
procedure allows requiring the same values for the reconstructed and target
interface. The reconstruction terminates when three conditions related to the
accuracy, interface and number of islands are fulfilled. We verify the approach
on digitized images of a thin metallic film and a concrete sample
cross-section. For a given accuracy, our method significantly reduces the
number of accepted Monte Carlo steps when compared to the standard approach. At
the same time, it provides credible shapes and similar areas of islands,
keeping their number and the total interface of the target. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to obtain such an outcome. The
cost-effective reconstructions suggest that the present technique could also be
used for patterns of islands with strongly jagged border lines.

have been studied by many authors, most notably by Schoenberg [Duke Math. J. 9,
1942] and Rudin [Duke Math. J. 26, 1959]. Following their work, it is
well-known that entrywise functions preserving Loewner positivity in all
dimensions are precisely the absolutely monotonic functions. However, there are
strong theoretical and practical motivations to study functions preserving
positivity in a fixed dimension $n$. Such characterizations for a fixed value
of $n$ are difficult to obtain, and in fact are only known in the $2 \times 2$
case. In this paper, using a novel and intuitive approach, we study entrywise
functions preserving positivity on distinguished submanifolds inside the cone
obtained by imposing rank constraints. These rank constraints are prevalent in
applications, and provide a natural way to relax the elusive original problem
of preserving positivity in a fixed dimension. In our main result, we
characterize entrywise functions mapping $n \times n$ positive semidefinite
matrices of rank at most $l$ into positive semidefinite matrices of rank at
most $k$ for $1 \leq l \leq n$ and $1 \leq k < n$. We also demonstrate how an
important necessary condition for preserving positivity by Horn and Loewner
[Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 136, 1969] can be significantly generalized by adding
rank constraints. Finally, our techniques allow us to obtain an elementary
proof of the classical characterization of functions preserving positivity in

where the relay first applies the 1) maximal-ratio combining (MRC) 2)
zero-forcing (ZF) 3) minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) principle to combine the
signal from the source, and then steers the transformed signal towards the
destination with the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) technique. For the
MRC/MRT and MMSE/MRT schemes, we present new tight analytical upper and lower
bounds for the ergodic capacity, while for the ZF/MRT scheme, we derive a new
exact analytical ergodic capacity expression. Moreover, we make a comparison
among all the three schemes, and our results reveal that, in terms of the
ergodic capacity performance, the MMSE/MRT scheme always has the best
performance and the ZF/MRT scheme is slightly inferior, while the MRC/MRT
scheme is always the worst one. Finally, the asymptotic behavior of ergodic
capacity for the three proposed schemes are characterized in large $N$
scenario, where $N$ is the number of relay antennas. Our results reveal that,
in the large $N$ regime, both the ZF/MRT and MMSE/MRT schemes have perfect

respect to network inference and associated prediction problems. We present a
general framework for both network inference and dynamical prediction that is
rooted in nonlinear biochemical kinetics. This is done by considering a
dynamical system based on a chemical reaction graph and associated kinetics
parameters. Inference regarding both parameters and the reaction graph itself
is carried out within a fully Bayesian framework. Prediction of dynamical
behavior is achieved by averaging over both parameters and reaction graphs,
allowing prediction even when the underlying reactions themselves are unknown

respectively. Millimeter interferometric observations have shown that these
sources have already formed central compact objects of ~100 AU sizes. Both
B1-bN and B1-bS are driving the CO outflows with low characteristic velocities
of ~2-4 km/s. The fractional abundance of H13CO+ at the positions of B1-bN and
B1-bS is lower than the canonical value by a factor of 4-8. This implies that
significant fraction of CO is depleted onto dust grains in dense gas
surrounding these sources. The observed physical and chemical properties
suggest that B1-bN and B1-bS are in the earlier evolutionary stage than most of
the known Class 0 protostars. Especially, the properties of B1-bN agree with
those of the first hydrostatic core predicted by the MHD simulations. The CO
outflow was also detected in the mid-IR source located at ~15"" from B1-bS.
Since the dust continuum emission was not detected in this source, the
circumstellar material surrounding this source is less than 0.01 M_sun. It is
likely that the envelope of this source was dissipated by the outflow from the

associative algebra containing a $p$-central subspace whose exponentiation form
is equal to the given form. There is an old question as for whether these
algebras have representations of finite rank over the center, and jointly with
Daniel Krashen and Max Lieblich we managed to provide a positive answer.
Different generalizations of the structure of the Clifford algebra are
presented and studied in that part too. The second part is dedicated to the
study of $p$-central subspaces of given central simple algebras, mainly tensor
products of cyclic algebras of degree $p$. Among the results, we prove that $5$
is the upper bound for the dimension of 4-central subspaces of cyclic algebras
of degree 4 containing pairs of standard generators. The third part is
dedicated to chain lemmas. Chain lemmas are of importance in the theory of
central simple algebras, because they form one approach to solving the word
problem for the Brauer group. We prove the chain lemma for biquaternion
algebras, both in characteristic 2 and characteristic not 2, and prove some
partial results on the chain lemmas for cyclic algebras of degree $p$. The
fourth part is dedicated to the more computational aspects of the theory. It
contains results on quaternion polynomial equations and on left eigenvalues of

data, there is strong evidence for the redshift-evolution of color-luminosity
parameter $\beta$. In this paper, adopting the $w$-cold-dark-matter ($w$CDM)
model and considering its interacting extensions (with three kinds of
interaction between dark sectors), we explore the evolution of $\beta$ and its
effects on parameter estimation. In addition to the SNLS3 data, we also take
into account the Planck distance priors data of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB), the galaxy clustering (GC) data extracted from SDSS DR7 and BOSS, as
well as the direct measurement of Hubble constant from the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) observation. We find that, for all the interacting dark energy
(IDE) models, adding a parameter of $\beta$ can reduce $\chi^2$ by $\sim$ 34,
indicating that $\beta_1 = 0$ is ruled out at 5.8$\sigma$ confidence level
(CL). Furthermore, it is found that varying $\beta$ can significantly change
the fitting results of various cosmological parameters: for all the dark energy
models considered in this paper, varying $\beta$ yields a larger $\Omega_{c0}$
and a larger $w$; on the other side, varying $\beta$ yields a smaller $h$ for
the $w$CDM model, but has no impact on $h$ for the three IDE models. This
implies that there is a degeneracy between $h$ and $\gamma$. Our work shows
that the evolution of $\beta$ is insensitive to the interaction between dark
sectors, and then highlights the importance of considering $\beta$'s evolution
in the cosmology fits.

The well-known Simon's lemma says that any $S\subseteq\{0, 1\}^n$ of
sensitivity $s$ must be of size at least $2^{n-s}$. This result has been useful
for proving lower bounds on sensitivity of Boolean functions, with applications
to the theory of parallel computing and the ""sensitivity vs. block sensitivity""
conjecture.
  In this paper, we take a deeper look at the size of such sets and their
structure. We show an unexpected ""gap theorem"": if $S\subseteq\{0, 1\}^n$ has
sensitivity $s$, then we either have $|S|=2^{n-s}$ or $|S|\geq \frac{3}{2}
2^{n-s}$. This is shown via classifying such sets into sets that can be
constructed from low-sensitivity subsets of $\{0, 1\}^{n'}$ for $n'<n$ and
irreducible sets which cannot be constructed in such a way and then proving a
lower bound on the size of irreducible sets.
  This provides new insights into the structure of low sensitivity subsets of
the Boolean hypercube $\{0, 1\}^n$.

jets measured with the ATLAS detector using proton-proton collision data with a
centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 4.7 fb$^{-1}$. Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits
forming topological clusters of calorimeter cells using the anti-k$_t$
algorithm with distance parameters $R=0.4$ or $R=0.6$, and are calibrated using
MC simulations. A residual JES correction is applied to account for differences
between data and MC simulations. This correction and its systematic uncertainty
are estimated using a combination of in situ techniques exploiting the
transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a
photon or a Z boson, for $20 < p_T < 1000$ GeV and pseudorapidities
$|\eta|<4.5$. The effect of multiple proton-proton interactions is corrected
for, and an uncertainty is evaluatedusing in situ techniques. The smallest JES
uncertainty of less than $1 %$ is found in the central calorimeter
region($|\eta|<1.2$) for jets with $55< p_T< 500$ GeV. For central jets at
lower $p_T$, the uncertainty is about $3 %$. A consistent JES estimate is found
using measurements of the calorimeter response of single hadrons in
proton-proton collisionsand test-beam data, which also provide the estimate for
$p_{T,jet} > 1$ TeV. The calibration of forward jets is derived from dijet
$p_T$ balance measurements. The resulting uncertainty reaches its largest value
of $6%$ for low-$p_T$ jets at $|\eta|=4.5$.
  Additional JES uncertainties due to specific event topologies, such as
close-by jets or selections of event samples with an enhanced content of jets
originating from light quarks or gluons, are also discussed. The magnitude of
these uncertainties depends on the event sample used in a given physics
analysis, but typically amounts to $0.5%$ to $3%$.

the probe of high scales via electron EDM within MSSM where the contributions
to the electric dipole moment (EDM) arise from the chargino and the neutralino
exchanges in loops. Here it is shown that the electron EDM can probe mass
scales from tens of TeV into the PeV range.The analysis is then extended to
include a vectorlike generation which can mix with the three ordinary

where the electron EDM as a function of the slepton mass first falls and become
vanishingly small and then rises again as the slepton mass increases This
phenomenon arises as a consequence of cancellation between the SUSY and the
non-SUSY contribution at low scales while at high scales the SUSY contribution
dies out and the EDM is controlled by the non-SUSY contribution alone. The high

\mathcal{J}_{\alpha}\right) $ thus becomes $\delta
dg_{\alpha}=\mathcal{T}_{\alpha}+\mathcal{J}_{\alpha}$, where $\left(
\mathcal{T}_{\alpha}\right) $ is identified as the gravitational
energy-momentum currents, to which we shall find a relatively simple and
physically appealing form. It is also shown that in the gravitational analogue
of the Lorenz gauge, our field equations can be written as a system of Proca
equations, which may be of interest in the study of propagation of
gravitational-electromagnetic waves.

Einstein gravity through hypersurface foliation, and observed that the 4D
Einstein gravity becomes renormalizable once all (or most) of the unphysical
degrees of freedom are removed. In this work, we confirm this observation from
a more mathematical angle. In particular, we show that the physical state
condition arising from the shift vector constraint connects with the
requirement that the manifold admit ""totally geodesic (TG) foliation"". The TG
foliation, in turn, makes it possible to view the 4D manifold as abelian
fibration over a 3D base. Associating the abelian fibration with the 4D
diffeomorphism leads to reduction of the 4D manifold to 3D, thereby realizing
and generalizing the holography of 't Hooft.

Calabi-yau compactification, there exists a gravitational hypermultiplet
$(g_{\mu\nu},\psi_{\mu},A_{\mu})$ and a universal hypermultiplet. In this paper
we derive the formulae for the masses of the scalar sector of the universal
hypermultiplet $(V,\sigma,\zeta,\bar{\zeta})$ in the framework of 5D Heterotic
