entire and declustered datasets, for which the aftershocks have been removed,
we initially investigate the frequency-magnitude distribution and find that
both datasets are well approximated by a physical model derived in the
framework of Non-extensive Statistical Physics. We then carry out a study of
the distribution of interevent times of seismic events for different magnitude
thresholds and discover that the data are well approximated by a statistical
distribution of the $q$-exponential type that allows us to compute analytically
the hazard function of earthquake production. Our analysis thus reveals further
evidence that the underlying dynamical process of earthquake birth reflects a
kind of nonlinear memory due to long-term persistence of seismic events.

around black holes using Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. Earlier,
it has been observed that in a significant part of the energy and angular
momentum parameter space, rotating transonic accretion flow undergoes shock
transition before entering in to the black hole and a part of the post-shock
matter is ejected as bipolar outflows, which are supposed to be the precursor
of relativistic jets. In this work, we simulate accretion flows having
injection parameters from the inviscid shock parameter space, and study the
response of viscosity on them. With the increase of viscosity, shock becomes
time dependent and starts to oscillate when the viscosity parameter crosses its
critical value. As a result, the in falling matter inside the post-shock region
exhibits quasi-periodic variations and causes periodic ejection of matter from
the inner disc as outflows. In addition, the same hot and dense post-shock
matter emits high energy radiation and the emanating photon flux also modulates
quasi-periodically. Assuming a ten solar mass black hole, the corresponding
power density spectrum peaks at the fundamental frequency of few Hz followed by
multiple harmonics. This feature is very common in several outbursting black
hole candidates. We discuss the implications of such periodic variations.

""Stochastic Analysis for Poisson Point Processes: Malliavin Calculus,

Peccati and Matthias Reitzner. The paper develops some basic theory for the
stochastic analysis of Poisson process on a general $\sigma$-finite measure
space. After giving some fundamental definitions and properties (as the
multivariate Mecke equation) the paper presents the Fock space representation
of square-integrable functions of a Poisson process in terms of iterated
difference operators. This is followed by the introduction of multivariate
stochastic Wiener-It\^o integrals and the discussion of their basic properties.
The paper then proceeds with proving the chaos expansion of square-integrable
Poisson functionals, and defining and discussing Malliavin operators. Further
topics are products of Wiener-It\^o integrals and Mehler's formula for the
inverse of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck generator based on a dynamic thinning
procedure. The survey concludes with covariance identities, the Poincar\'e
inequality and the FKG-inequality.

an out-of-sample dyad have not been observed during training, or if one of them

problem is to train a model that makes predictions based on a pairwise feature
representation of the dyads, or, in case of kernel methods, based on a tensor
product pairwise kernel. As an alternative to such a kernel approach, we
introduce a novel two-step learning algorithm that borrows ideas from the
fields of pairwise learning and spectral filtering. We show theoretically that
the two-step method is very closely related to the tensor product kernel
approach, and experimentally that it yields a slightly better predictive
performance. Moreover, unlike existing tensor product kernel methods, the
two-step method allows closed-form solutions for training and parameter
selection via cross-validation estimates both in the full and almost full cold

surrounding a host galaxy other than the Milky Way. Our sample consists of
individual metallicity measurements for 1243 red giant branch (RGB) member
stars spread across these six systems. We determine metallicities based on the
strength of the Ca II triplet lines using the empirical calibration of Carrera
et al.(2013) which is calibrated over the metallicity range -4 < [Fe/H] <+0.5.
We find that these M31 satellites lie on the same luminosity-metallicity
relationship as the Milky Way dwarf satellites. We do not find a trend between
the internal metallicity spread and galaxy luminosity, contrary to previous
studies. The MDF widths of And II and And VII are similar to the MW dwarfs of
comparable luminosity, however, our four brightest M31 dwarf are more luminous
than any of the MW dwarf spheroidals and have broader MDFs. The MDFs of our six
M31 dwarfs are consistent with the leaky box model of chemical evolution,
although our metallicity errors allow a wide range of evolution models. We find
a significant radial gradient in metallicity in only two of our six systems,
NGC 185 and Andromeda II, and flat radial metallicity gradients in the rest of
our sample with no observed correlation between rotational support and radial
metallicity gradients. While the average properties and radial trends of the
M31 dwarf galaxies agree with MW counterparts at similar luminosity, the
detailed MDFs are different, particularly at the metal-rich end.

are defined through hadronic matrix elements of QCD operators. The components
consist of the quark mass term, the quark energy term, the glue energy term,
and the trace anomaly term. We calculate these components for mesons with
lattice QCD for the first time. The calculation is carried out with overlap
fermion on $2+1$ flavor domain-wall fermion gauge configurations. We confirm
that $\sim 50\%$ of the light pion mass comes from the quark mass term and
$\sim 10\%$ comes from the quark energy; whereas, while for the $\rho$ meson,
the quark energy contributes roughly half of its mass but the quark mass term
contributes little. The combined glue components contribute $\sim 40 - 50\%$
for both mesons. It is interesting to observe that the quark mass contribution
to the mass of the vector meson is almost linear in quark mass over a large
quark mass region below the charm quark mass. For heavy mesons, the quark mass
term dominates the masses, while the contribution from the glue components is
about $200$ MeV (a bare value around 2GeV) for the heavy pseudoscalar and
vector mesons. The charmonium hyperfine splitting is found to be dominated by
the quark energy term which is consistent with the picture of the quark
potential model.

The cluster consensus contains two aspects: intra-cluster synchronization, that

inter-cluster separation, that the states of the agents in different clusters
do not approach. $\delta$-cluster-spanning-tree in continuous-time networks of

recovery capability grows with age (a child has poor push recovery than an

recovery than an ordinary man. However, the mechanism of reactive push recovery
is not known to us. We tried to understand the human learning mechanism by
conducting several experiments. The subjects for the experiments were selected
both as right handed and left handed. Pushes were induced from the behind with
close eyes to observe the motor action as well as with open eyes to observe
learning based reactive behaviors. Important observations show that the left
handed and right handed persons negotiate pushes differently (in opposite
manner). The present research describes some details about the experiments and
the analyses of the results mainly obtained from the joint angle variations

smoothening the captured data through higher order polynomials, we feed them to
our model which was developed exploiting the physics of an inverted pendulum

framework available in our laboratory. In each cases the model also could
recover from the push for the same rage of perturbation which proves the
correctness of the model. Hence the model now can provide greater insight to
push recovery mechanism and can be used for determining push recovery strategy

over time. This dynamic behavior is either caused by external factors or
initiated by the system designers themselves. To adapt to such conditions,
sensor networks often adopt machine learning techniques to eliminate the need
for unnecessary redesign. Machine learning also inspires many practical
solutions that maximize resource utilization and prolong the lifespan of the
network. In this paper, we present an extensive literature review over the
period 2002-2013 of machine learning methods that were used to address common
issues in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The advantages and disadvantages of
each proposed algorithm are evaluated against the corresponding problem. We
also provide a comparative guide to aid WSN designers in developing suitable
machine learning solutions for their specific application challenges.

principles to guide the construction of sustainable computer applications.
Tangible properties include a) unlimited scalability, b) maximal

sustainable scientific application should be written once and execute many
times on multiple different processing platforms of different scales with
optimized performance and energy efficiency. For more than two decades,
explicit parallel programming/processing paradigms only focused on performance.
Practices showed that the rigid program-data binding prohibited dynamic runtime
resource optimization and fault isolation, making it difficult to reproduce
applications in scale. This paper reports our practice and experiences in

To elucidate their physical origin we develop a model of the inner workings of

conformational switch of the tubulin dimer. We show that the microtubule
lattice itself coexists in discrete polymorphic states. Curved states can be

only virtually unbreakable under typical cellular forces, but moreover provides
them with a tunable response integrating mechanical and chemical stimuli.

AND-compression for SAT. The result has implications for the compressibility
and kernelizability of a whole range of NP-complete parameterized problems. We
present a streamlined proof of Drucker's theorem.
  An AND-compression is a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that maps a
set of SAT-instances $x_1,\dots,x_t$ to a single SAT-instance $y$ of size
poly(max $|x_i|$) such that $y$ is satisfiable if and only if all $x_i$ are
satisfiable. The ""AND"" in the name stems from the fact that the predicate ""$y$
is satisfiable"" can be written as the AND of all predicates ""$x_i$ is
satisfiable"". Drucker's result complements the result by Bodlaender et al.
(2009) and Fortnow and Santhanam (2010), who proved the analogous statement for
OR-compressions, and Drucker's proof not only subsumes that result but also
extends it to randomized compression algorithms that are allowed to have a
certain probability of failure.
  Drucker (2012) presented two proofs: The first uses information theory and
the minimax theorem from game theory, and the second is an elementary,
iterative proof that is not as general. In our proof, we realize the iterative
structure as a generalization of the arguments of Ko (1983) for P-selective
sets, which use the fact that tournaments have dominating sets of logarithmic
size. We generalize this fact to hypergraph tournaments. Our proof achieves the
full generality of Drucker's theorem, avoids the minimax theorem, and restricts
the use of information theory to a single, intuitive lemma about the average
noise sensitivity of compressive maps. To prove this lemma, we use the same
information-theoretic inequalities as Drucker.

variation of the modeling scales, theoretically there should have a continuous
spectrum of fluid dynamic equations. In order to study multiscale flow
evolution efficiently, the dynamics in the computational fluid has to be
changed with the scales. A direct modeling of flow physics with a changeable
scale may become an appropriate approach. The unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS)
is a direct modeling method in the mesh size scale, and its underlying flow
physics depends on the resolution of the cell size relative to the particle
mean free path. The cell size of UGKS is not limited by the particle mean free
path. With the variation of the ratio between the numerical cell size and local
particle mean free path, the UGKS recovers the flow dynamics from the particle
transport and collision in the kinetic scale to the wave propagation in the
hydrodynamic scale.
  The previous UGKS is mostly constructed from the evolution solution of
kinetic model equations. This work is about the further development of the UGKS
with the implementation of the full Boltzmann collision term in the region
where it is needed. The central ingredient of the UGKS is the coupled treatment
of particle transport and collision in the flux evaluation across a cell
interface, where a continuous flow dynamics from kinetic to hydrodynamic scales
is modeled. The newly developed UGKS has the asymptotic preserving (AP)
property of recovering the NS solutions in the continuum flow regime, and the
full Boltzmann solution in the rarefied regime. In the mostly unexplored
transition regime, the UGKS itself provides a valuable tool for the flow study
in this regime. The mathematical properties of the scheme, such as stability,
accuracy, and the asymptotic preserving, will be analyzed in this paper as
well.

processes accounting for the spreading of an epidemics, and the spreading of
information awareness to prevent its infection, on top of multiplex networks.
The results in the case in which awareness implies total immunization to the
disease, revealed the existence of a metacritical point at which the critical
onset of the epidemics starts depending on the reaching of the awareness
process. Here we present a full analysis of these critical properties in the
more general scenario where the awareness spreading does not imply total
immunization, and where infection does not imply immediate awareness of it. We
find the critical relation between both competing processes for a wide spectrum
of parameters representing the interaction between them. We also analyze the
consequences of a massive broadcast of awareness (mass media) on the final
outcome of the epidemic incidence. Importantly enough, the mass media makes the
metacritical point to disappear. The results reveal that the main finding i.e.
existence of a metacritical point, is rooted on the competition principle and
holds for a large set of scenarios.

between descending sequences of ordinals epsilon_0 and sequences of integers,
now known as Goodstein sequences. This article revisits Goodstein's 1944 paper.
In light of new historical details found in a correspondence between Bernays
and Goodstein, we address the question of how close Goodstein came to proving
an independence result for PA. We also present an elementary proof of the fact
that already the termination of all special Goodstein sequences, i.e. those
induced by the shift function, is not provable in PA. This was first proved by
Kirby and Paris in 1982, using techniques from the model theory of arithmetic.
The proof presented here arguably only uses tools that would have been
available in the 1940's or 1950's. Thus we ponder the question whether striking
independence results could have been proved much earlier? In the same vein we
also wonder whether the search for strictly mathematical examples of an
incompleteness in PA really attained its ""holy grail"" status before the late
1970's. Almost no direct moral is ever given; rather, the paper strives to lay
out evidence for the reader to consider and have the reader form their own

linearly polarized laser field we obtain a remarkable agreement between the
zero-order energy as well as amplitude and phase of the zero-order Floquet
states and the exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Floquet operator.
Here we use as a zero-order Hamiltonian the adiabatic Hamiltonian where time is
used as an instantaneous parameter. Moreover, for a variety of low laser
frequencies, $\omega$, the deviation of the zero-order solutions from the exact
quasi-energy (QE) Floquet solutions approaches zero at the time the oscillating
laser field is maximal. This remarkable result gives a further justification to
the validity of the first step in the simple man model. It should be stressed
that the numerical calculations of the exact QE (Floquet) solutions become
extremely difficult when $\omega$ approaches zero and many Floquet channels are
nested together and are coupled by the laser field. This is the main motivation
for the development of perturbation theory for QE (Floquet) solutions when the
laser frequency is small, to avoid the need to represent the Floquet operator
by a matrix when the Fourier functions are used as a basis set. A way to
calculate the radius of convergence of the perturbational expansion of the
Floquet solutions in $\omega$ is given.

and also the signal rates of e^+e^-\to Zh with the Higgs boson decaying to
b\bar b and \gamma\gamma. We have following observations: (1) In the heavy
dilaton scenario, the deviation of \sigma(e^+e^-\to Zh) from its SM prediction
can vary from -15\% to 85\%, which mainly arises from the modification of the
tree-level hZZ coupling and also the radiative correction induced by possibly
large Higgs self-couplings. (2) The processes e^+e^-\to Zh at the Higgs factory
and pp\to hh at 14-TeV LHC are complementary in limiting the MDM parameter
space. Requiring the deviation of \sigma(e^+e^-\to Zh) from its SM prediction
to be less than 1\% and that of \sigma(p p \to h h) to be less than 50\%, \tan
\theta_S in the MDM will be limited to be -0.1<\tan\theta_S<0.3, and the
deviations of the signal rates are constrained to be |R_{b\bar b}|<2\% and
|R_{\gamma\gamma}|<7\%. Especially, the Higgs self-coupling normalized to its

its size to be less than 1\% will result in 0<\tan\theta_S<0.1, and -10\% <

allowed us to carry out the spectral classification of the OB-type candidates.
  Of the 21 spectroscopically observed stars, ten are classified as OB-type
stars, eight as F- to early G-type dwarf stars, and three as late-type giant
stars. Spectroscopically estimated distances indicate that the OB-type stars
belong to the same cluster, located at a distance of $1.90^{+1.28}_{-0.90}$

population, with a clear concentration of pre-main-sequence massive candidates

quantum information science to many-body systems. In order to grasp the essence
of this phenomenon, it is fundamental to understand how different
manifestations of entanglement relate to each other. In 1999, Peres conjectured
that Bell nonlocality is equivalent to distillability of entanglement. The
intuition of Peres was that the non-classicality of an entangled state, as
witnessed via Bell inequality violation, implies that pure entanglement can be
distilled from this state, hence making it useful for most quantum information
protocols. Subsequently, the Peres conjecture was shown to hold true in several
specific cases, and became a central open question in quantum information
theory. Here we disprove the Peres conjecture by showing that an undistillable
bipartite entangled state---a bound entangled state---can nevertheless violate
a Bell inequality. This shows that Bell nonlocality implies neither
entanglement distillability, nor non-positivity under partial transposition,
thus clarifying the relation between three fundamental aspects of entanglement.
Finally, our results lead to a novel application of bound entanglement for
device-independent randomness certification.

selection scheme from the family of kernel estimators with varying bandwidths.
For proposed estimator we establish so-called Lp-norm oracle inequality and use
it for deriving minimax adaptive results. We prove the existence of
rate-adaptive estimators and fully characterize behavior of the minimax risk
for different relationships between regularity parameters and norm indexes in
definitions of the functional class and of the risk. In particular some new
asymptotics of the minimax risk are discovered including necessary and
sufficient conditions for existence a uniformly consistent estimator. We
provide also with detailed overview of existing methods and results and
formulate open problems in adaptive minimax estimation.

  Comprehensive Study and Good Practice",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video based action recognition is one of the important and challenging
problems in computer vision research. Bag of Visual Words model (BoVW) with
local features has become the most popular method and obtained the
state-of-the-art performance on several realistic datasets, such as the HMDB51,
UCF50, and UCF101. BoVW is a general pipeline to construct a global
representation from a set of local features, which is mainly composed of five
steps: (i) feature extraction, (ii) feature pre-processing, (iii) codebook
generation, (iv) feature encoding, and (v) pooling and normalization. Many
efforts have been made in each step independently in different scenarios and
their effect on action recognition is still unknown. Meanwhile, video data
exhibits different views of visual pattern, such as static appearance and
motion dynamics. Multiple descriptors are usually extracted to represent these
different views. Many feature fusion methods have been developed in other areas
and their influence on action recognition has never been investigated before.
This paper aims to provide a comprehensive study of all steps in BoVW and
different fusion methods, and uncover some good practice to produce a
state-of-the-art action recognition system. Specifically, we explore two kinds
of local features, ten kinds of encoding methods, eight kinds of pooling and
normalization strategies, and three kinds of fusion methods. We conclude that
every step is crucial for contributing to the final recognition rate.
Furthermore, based on our comprehensive study, we propose a simple yet
effective representation, called hybrid representation, by exploring the
complementarity of different BoVW frameworks and local descriptors. Using this
representation, we obtain the state-of-the-art on the three challenging
datasets: HMDB51 (61.1%), UCF50 (92.3%), and UCF101 (87.9%).

hyperbolic equations, but several extensions of the Semi-Lagrangian approach to
diffusion and advection--diffusion problems have been proposed recently. These
extensions are mostly based on probabilistic arguments and share the common
feature of treating second-order operators in trace form, which makes them
unsuitable for mass conservative models like the classical formulations of
turbulent diffusion employed in computational fluid dynamics. We propose here
some basic ideas for treating second-order operators in divergence form. A
general framework for constructing consistent schemes in one space dimension is
presented, and a specific case of nonconservative discretization is discussed
in detail and analysed. Finally, an extension to (possibly nonlinear) problems
in an arbitrary number of dimensions is proposed. Although the resulting
discretization approach is only of first order in time, numerical results in a
number of test cases highlight the advantages of these methods for applications
to computational fluid dynamics and their superiority over to more standard low

massive, multi-epoch survey of stellar variability in the near-infrared, the
template light-curves that are required for training the classification
algorithms are not available. In the first paper of the series we describe the
construction of this comprehensive database of infrared stellar variability.
Methods. First we performed a systematic search in the literature and public

third we exploited the VVV variability database itself on (optically)
well-known stars to gather high-quality infrared light-curves of several
hundreds of variable stars. Results. We have now collected a significant (and
still increasing) number of infrared template light-curves. This database will
be used as a training-set for the machine-learning algorithms that will
automatically classify the light-curves produced by VVV. The results of such an
automated classification will be covered in forthcoming papers of the series.
