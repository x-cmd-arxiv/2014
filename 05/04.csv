recently by Elson and McKeown (2010). In our work this technique is used in
combination with the detection of vocatives - the explicit forms of address

during the current high state of V1180 Cas are presented, in conjunction with
H2 narrow-band imaging of the source. Observed near-IR colour variations are
analogous to those observed in EXors and consistent with excess emission
originating from an accretion event. The spectra show numerous emission lines,
which indicates accretion, ejection of matter, and an active disc. Using
optical and near-IR emission features we derive a mass accretion rate of ~3 E-8
Msun/yr, which is an order of magnitude lower than previous estimates. In
addition, a mass loss rate of ~4 E-9 and ~4 E-10 Msun/yr are estimated from
atomic forbidden lines and H2, respectively. Our H2 imaging reveals two bright
knots of emission around the source and the nearby optically invisible star
V1180 Cas B, clearly indicative of mass-loss phenomena. Higher resolution

flux tube in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium, described in Gent et al. (MNRAS,
435, 689, 2013). Self-similar magnetic flux tubes are combined to form magnetic
structures, which are consistent with high-resolution observations. The
observational evidence supports the existence of strands of open flux tubes and
loops persisting in a relatively steady state. Self-similar magnetic flux
tubes, for which an analytic solution to the plasma density and pressure
distribution is possible, are combined. We calculate the appropriate balancing
forces, applying to the equations of momentum and energy conservation to
preserve equilibrium.
  Multiplex flux tube configurations are observed to remain relatively stable

condition for numerical studies of energy transport mechanisms from the solar

pressure and temperature distributions consistent with observational and
theoretical estimates for the lower solar atmosphere. Although each flux tube
is identical in construction apart from the location of the radial axis,
combinations can be applied to generate a non-axisymmetric magnetic field with
multiple non-uniform flux tubes. This is a considerable step forward in
modelling the realistic magnetized three-dimensional equilibria of the solar

shock (both protons and electrons). Our model couples hydrodynamic simulations
of a supernova remnant with a kinetic treatment of particle acceleration. We
include two important back-reaction loops upstream of the shock: energetic
particles can (i) modify the flow structure and (ii) amplify the magnetic
field. As the latter process is not fully understood, we use different limit
cases that encompass a wide range of possibilities. We follow the history of
the shock dynamics and of the particle transport downstream of the shock, which
allows us to compute the non-thermal emission from the remnant at any given
age. We do this in 3D, in order to generate projected maps that can be compared
with observations. We observe that completely different recipes for the
magnetic field can lead to similar modifications of the shock structure,
although to very different configurations of the field and particles. We show
how this affects the emission patterns in different energy bands, from radio to
X-rays and $\gamma$-rays. High magnetic fields ($>100 \mu$G) directly impact
the synchrotron emission from electrons, by restricting their emission to thin
rims, and indirectly impact the inverse Compton emission from electrons and
also the pion decay emission from protons, mostly by shifting their cut-off
energies to respectively lower and higher energies.

observations from GAS/Ulysses. Recapitulation of results on the helium inflow
direction from the past ~40 years suggested that the inflow direction may be
changing with time. We reanalyze the old Ulysses data and reprocess them to
increase the accuracy of the instrument pointing to investigate if the GAS
observations support the hypothesis that the interstellar helium inflow
direction is changing. We employ a similar analysis method as in the analysis
of the IBEX data. We seek a parameter set that minimizes reduced chi-squared,
using the Warsaw Test Particle Model for the interstellar He flux at Ulysses
with a state of the art model of neutral He ionization in the heliosphere, and
precisely reproducing the observation conditions. We also propose a
supplementary method of constraining the parameters based on cross-correlations
of parameters obtained from analysis of carefully selected subsets of data. We
find that the ecliptic longitude and speed of interstellar He are in a very
good agreement with the values reported in the original GAS analysis. We find,
however, that the temperature is markedly higher. The 3-seasons optimum
parameter set is lambda = 255.3, beta = 6, v = 26.0 km/s, T = 7500 K. We find
no evidence that it is varying with time, but the uncertainty range is larger
than originally reported. The originally-derived parameters of interstellar He
from GAS are in good agreement with presently derived, except for the
temperature, which seems to be appreciably higher, in good agreement with
interstellar absorption line results. While the results of the present analysis
are in marginal agreement with the earlier reported results from IBEX, the most
likely values from the two analyses differ for reasons that are still not
understood.

The predicted height-resolved sand flux and other important characteristics of
the aeolian transport layer agree remarkably well with a comprehensive
compilation of field and wind tunnel data, suggesting that the model robustly
captures the essential mesoscale physics. By comparing the saturation length
with field data for the minimum sand-dune size, we can reconcile conflicting
previous models for this most enigmatic emergent aeolian scale and elucidate
the importance of intermittent turbulent wind fluctuations for field

improving Quality-of-Experience (QoE) of users, we consider the design of
scheduling strategies in multi-hop wireless networks that not only maximize
system throughput but also provide regular inter-service times for all links.
Since the service regularity of links is related to the higher-order statistics
of the arrival process and the policy operation, it is highly challenging to
characterize and analyze directly. We overcome this obstacle by introducing a
new quantity, namely the time-since-last-service (TSLS), which tracks the time
since the last service. By combining it with the queue-length in the weight, we
propose a novel maximum-weight type scheduling policy, called Regular Service
Guarantee (RSG) Algorithm. The unique evolution of the TSLS counter poses
significant challenges for the analysis of the RSG Algorithm.
  To tackle these challenges, we first propose a novel Lyapunov function to
show the throughput optimality of the RSG Algorithm. Then, we prove that the
RSG Algorithm can provide service regularity guarantees by using the
Lyapunov-drift based analysis of the steady-state behavior of the stochastic
processes. In particular, our algorithm can achieve a degree of service
regularity within a factor of a fundamental lower bound we derive. This factor
is a function of the system statistics and design parameters and can be as low
as two in some special networks. Our results, both analytical and numerical,
exhibit significant service regularity improvements over the traditional
throughput-optimal policies, which reveals the importance of incorporating the
metric of time-since-last-service into the scheduling policy for providing
regulated service.

Using a unique and detailed data set from Spain, we study the relationship

approach, by letting immigrant density play the role of ""time"", and the
quantifier the role of ""space"" it become possible to analyze the behavior of
the quantifiers by means of continuous time random walks. Two classes of
results are obtained. First we show that social integration quantifiers evolve
following pure diffusion law, while the evolution of economic quantifiers
exhibit ballistic dynamics. Second we make predictions of best and worst case
scenarios taking into account large local fluctuations. Our stochastic process
approach to integration lends itself to interesting forecasting scenarios
which, in the hands of policy makers, have the potential to improve political
responses to integration problems. For instance, estimating the standard
first-passage time and maximum-span walk reveals local differences in
integration performance for different immigration scenarios. Thus, by
recognizing the importance of local fluctuations around national means, this
research constitutes an important tool to assess the impact of immigration
phenomena on municipal budgets and to set up solid multi-ethnic plans at the
municipal level as immigration pressure build.

undecidable: Energy games on one-counter automata with a 2-dimensional energy

over the locations using an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
strategy, and thus greatly reduces the computational burden. Furthermore, we
propose to select the appropriate model through a novel sequence of faster
algorithmic solutions that is similar to regularization paths. We will
demonstrate both the computational and predictive modeling advantages of our

length of the sticks, the standard deviation of the length distribution, and
the standard deviation of the angular distribution. We developed a computer
algorithm capable of reproducing and verifying known theoretical results for
isotropic networks and which allows us to go beyond and study anisotropic

of causal set (causet) called a $c$-causet. A $c$-causet is defined to be a
causet that is independent of its labeling. We characterize $c$-causets as
those causets that form a multipartite graph or equivalently those causets
whose elements are comparable whenever their heights are different. We show
that a $c$-causet has precisely two $c$-causet offspring. It follows that there
are $2^n$ $c$-causets of cardinality $n+1$. This enables us to classify
$c$-causets of cardinality $n+1$ in terms of $n$-bits. We then quantize the
model by introducing a quantum sequential growth process. This is accomplished
by replacing the $n$-bits by $n$-qubits and defining transition amplitudes for
the growth transitions. We mainly consider two types of processes called
stationary and completely stationary. We show that for stationary processes,
the probability operators are tensor products of positive rank-1 qubit
operators. Moreover, the converse of this result holds. Simplifications occur
for completely stationary processes. We close with examples of precluded

The main identities for the linear Finsler connection are presented in the
general case, and then specialized to some notable cases like Berwald's,
Cartan's or Chern-Rund's. In this way it becomes easy to compare them and see
the advantages of one connection over the other. Since we introduce two
soldering forms we are able to characterize the notable Finsler connections in
terms of their torsion properties. As an application, the curvature symmetries
implied by the compatibility with a metric suggest that in Finslerian
generalizations of general relativity the mean Cartan torsion vanishes. This
observation allows us to obtain dynamical equations which imply a satisfactory
conservation law. The work ends with a discussion of yet another Finsler
connection which has some advantages over Cartan's and Chern-Rund's.

Matsubara ultra-violet integration and the infrared integration around the zero
set of the dispersion relation. The multi-scale integration schemes are
implemented in a finite-dimensional Grassmann algebra indexed by discrete
position-time variables. In order that the multi-scale integrations are
justified inductively, various scale-dependent estimates on Grassmann
polynomials are established. We apply these theories in practice to prove that
for the half-filled Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hopping on a square
lattice the infinite-volume, zero-temperature limit of the free energy density
exists as an analytic function of the coupling constant in a neighborhood of
the origin if the system contains the magnetic flux pi (mod 2 pi) per plaquette
and 0 (mod 2 pi) through the large circles around the periodic lattice.
Combined with Lieb's result on the flux phase problem ([Lieb, E. H., Phys. Rev.

density of the flux phase problem converges to an analytic function of the
coupling constant in the infinite-volume, zero-temperature limit. The proof of

extension of Giuliani-Mastropietro's renormalization designed for the

reconstruction (IR) techniques appear particularly promising since they can
provide accurate system model. The system model matrix which describes the
relationship between image space and projection space is important to the image
quality. It contains some factors such as geometrical component and blurring
component. The blurring component is usually described by point spread function
(PSF). A PSF matrix derived from the single photon incidence response function
is studied. And then an IR method based on the system matrix containing the PSF
is developed. More specifically, the gamma photon incidence on a crystal array
is simulated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, and then the single photon
incidence response functions are calculated. Subsequently, the single photon
incidence response functions is used to compute the coincidence blurring factor
according to the physical process of PET coincidence detection. Through
weighting the ordinary system matrix response by the coincidence blurring
factors, the IR system matrix containing PSF is finally established. Using this
system matrix, the image is reconstructed by ordered subset expectation
maximization (OSEM) algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed
system matrix can obviously improve the image radial resolution, contrast and
noise property. Furthermore, the simulated single gamma-ray incidence response
function only depends on the crystal configuration, so the method could be
extended to any PET scanners with the same detector crystal configuration.

overviewed and a perspective is presented within the context of a real gas,
modeled by the van der Waals equation of state. The regular reflection
configuration and the detachment criterion are studied in the light of real gas
effects. Some basic features of the phenomenon and the nature of the
self-similar flow pattern are explored using asymptotic expansions. The
analysis presented here predicts several inviscid flow properties of the real

indicate the bolometric powers of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), especially
given the attenuation caused by the circumnuclear material and the possible
contamination by components related to star formation. Here we use mid-IR
spectra along with multiwavelength data to investigate the merit of various
diagnostics of AGN radiative power, including the mid-IR [Ne III] lambda25.89
mum and [O IV] lambda25.89 mum fine-structure lines, the optical [O III]
lambda5007 forbidden line, and mid-IR 24 mum, 5 GHz radio, and X-ray continuum
emission, for complete samples of 46 2Jy radio galaxies (0.05 < z < 0.7) and 17
3CRR FRII radio galaxies (z < 0.1). We find that the mid-IR [O IV] line is the
most reliable indicator of AGN power for powerful radio-loud AGNs. By assuming
that the [O IV] is emitted isotropically, and comparing the [O III] and 24 mum
luminosities of the broad- and narrow-line AGNs in our samples at fixed [O IV]
luminosity, we show that the [O III] and 24 mum emission are both mildly
attenuated in the narrow-line compared to the broad-line objects by a factor of
#2. However, despite this attenuation, the [O III] and 24 mum luminosities are
better AGN power indicators for our sample than either the 5 GHz radio or the
X-ray continuum luminosities. We also detect the mid-IR 9.7 mum silicate
feature in the spectra of many objects but not ubiquitously: at least 40% of
the sample shows no clear evidence for these features. We conclude that, for
the majority of powerful radio galaxies, the mid-IR lines are powered by AGN

partially correlated noise environments where the noise covariance matrix is
sparse. A sparse noise covariance matrix is a common model for a sparse array
of sensors consisted of several widely separated subarrays. Since interelement
spacing among sensors in a subarray is small, the noise in the subarray is in
general spatially correlated, while, due to large distances between subarrays,
the noise between them is uncorrelated. Consequently, the noise covariance
matrix of such an array has a block diagonal structure which is indeed sparse.
Moreover, in an ordinary nonsparse array, because of small distance between
adjacent sensors, there is noise coupling between neighboring sensors, whereas
one can assume that nonadjacent sensors have spatially uncorrelated noise which
makes again the array noise covariance matrix sparse. Utilizing some recently
available tools in low-rank/sparse matrix decomposition, matrix completion, and
sparse representation, we propose a novel method which can resolve possibly
correlated or even coherent sources in the aforementioned partly correlated
noise. In particular, when the sources are uncorrelated, our approach involves
solving a second-order cone programming (SOCP), and if they are correlated or
coherent, one needs to solve a computationally harder convex program. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by numerical
simulations and comparison to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB).

torus are expected to be bounded instead of free, the deviation of the
scattering cross section from the Klein-Nishina cross section has also been
included, which changes the X-ray spectra by up to 25% below $10$ keV. We have
investigated the effect of the clumpiness parameters on the reflection spectra
and the strength of the fluorescent line Fe K$\alpha$. The volume filling
factor of the clouds in the clumpy torus only slightly influences the
reflection spectra, however, the total column density and the number of clouds
along the line of sight significantly change the shapes and amplitudes of the
reflection spectra. The effect of column density is similar to the case of a
smooth torus, while a small number of clouds along the line of sight will
smooth out the anisotropy of the reflection spectra and the fluorescent line Fe
K$\alpha$. The smoothing effect is mild in the low column density case
($\NH=10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$), whereas it is much more evident in the high column
density case ($\NH=10^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$). Our model provides a quantitative tool

channel to form intermediate-mass binary pulsars (IMBPs) with a short orbital
period (less than 3 d) via stable mass transfer. The main reason is that the
magnetic braking mechanisms are generally thought not to work for donor stars
with a mass of greater than 1.5 $\rm M_{\odot}$ in the canonical model.
However, some intermediate-mass stars have anomalously strong magnetic fields
(about 100 -- 10000 G), i. e. so-called Ap or Bp stars. With the coupling
between the magnetic field and the irradiation-driven wind from the surface of
Ap/Bp stars, a plausible magnetic braking mechanism should be expected. In this
work, we attempt to investigate if IMXBs with Ap/Bp stars can produce IMBPs
with a short orbital period (less than 3 d) by such an anomalous magnetic
braking mechanism. Using a stellar evolution code, we have simulated the
evolution of a large number of IMXBs consisting of a NS and an Ap/Bp star. For
the spin evolution of the NS, we consider the accretion torque, the propeller
torque, and the spin-down torque caused by the interaction between the magnetic
field and the accretion disc. The calculated results show that, employing
anomalous magnetic braking of Ap/Bp stars, IMXBs can evolve into compact IMBPs
with short orbital periods of less than 3 d. However, there exists significant
discrepancy between the spin periods of IMBPs in our simulated results and
those observed.

the power of acoustic waves is reduced within the photospheric layers. Recent

and magnetic elements, by modelling each as a collection of vertically aligned
magnetic fibrils and presuming that the velocity within each fibril is the
response to buffeting by incident $p$ modes in the surrounding field-free
atmosphere. We restrict our attention to modeling observations made near solar
disk center, where the line-of-sight velocity is nearly vertical and hence,
only the longitudinal component of the motion within the fibril contributes.
Therefore, we only consider the excitation of axisymmetric sausage waves and
ignore kink oscillations as their motions are primarily horizontal. We compare
the vertical motion within the fibril with the vertical motion of the incident
$p$ mode by constructing the ratio of their powers. In agreement with
observational measurements we find that the total power is suppressed within
strong magnetic elements for frequencies below the acoustic cut-off frequency.
We also find that the magnitude of the power deficit increases with the height
above the photosphere at which the measurement is made. Further, we argue that
the area of the solar disk over which the power suppression extends increases
as a function of height.

rectangular matrix is the key ingredient in many scientific and engineering
computations. A powerful tool to manage the matrix exponential function is to
resort to a suitable rational approximation such as the Carath$\acute{\rm
e}$odory-Fej$\acute{\rm e}$r approximation, whose core reduces to solve shifted
linear systems with multiple right-hand sides. The restarted and shifted block
FOM algorithm is a commonly used technique for this problem. However,
determining good preconditioners for shifted systems that preserve the original
structure is a difficult task. In this paper, we propose a new preconditioner
for the restarted and shifted block FOM algorithm. The key is that the absolute
values of the poles of the Carath$\acute{\rm e}$odory-Fej$\acute{\rm e}$r
approximation are medium sized and can be much smaller than the norm of the
matrix in question. The advantages of the proposed strategy are that we can
precondition all the shifted linear systems simultaneously, and preserve the
original structure of the shifted linear systems after restarting. Theoretical
results are provided to show the rationality of our preconditioning strategy.
Applications of the new approach to Toeplitz matrix exponential problem are
also discussed. Numerical experiments illustrate the superiority of the new
algorithm over many state-of-the-art algorithms for matrix exponential.

the burst detection algorithm that is improved in this study. The peak flux of
the type-I bursts followed a power-law distribution with a spectral index of
2.9-3.3, whereas their duration and bandwidth were distributed more

the subsequent stages of the generation of non-thermal electrons, such as
plasma wave generation, radio wave emissions, and propagation. The variation of
the time scale of the growth rate is significantly larger than that of the
coronal environments. These results can be explained by the situation that the
source region may have the inhomogeneity of an ambient plasma environment, such
as the boundary of open and closed field lines, and the superposition of entire
emitted bursts was observed by the spectrometer.

on the design and performance of this gaseous detector. In particular, uniform
and linear response, low noise and stability against high ionisation density
deposits are prerequisites to achieving good energy resolution. A
Micromegas-based hadronic calorimeter was proposed for an application at a
future linear collider experiment and three technologically advanced prototypes
of 1$\times$1 m$^{2}$ were constructed. Their merits relative to the
above-mentioned criteria are discussed on the basis of measurements performed
at the CERN SPS test-beam facility.

the current established but enigmatic concordance model of Cosmology. Should
the model be understood by adding new entities such as Dark Matter and Dark
Energy, or by modifying the underlying theory? For example, the prediction and
discovery of planet Neptune can be regarded as analogous to finding a dark
component; while explaining the anomalous perihelion precession of Mercury by
General Relativity can be taken as analogous to the possibility that modified
gravity is an alternative to dark components of the universe. In this paper, we
revise this analogy coming from the history of astronomy with an eye to
illustrating some of the similarities and differences between the two cases.

not only from below but also from above. It is shown that this, somehow removes
the distinction between repulsive and attractive forces. In particular, it is
seen that a region with attractive force would appear forbidden for states with
energies higher than a certain value, while repulsive forces could develop
bound-states. An explicit transformation is introduced which transforms the
spectrum of a system corresponding to a repulsive force, to that of a similar
system corresponding to an attractive force. Explicit numerical examples are
presented for discrete energies of bound-states of a particle experiencing
repulsive force by a piecewise constant potential. Finally, the parameters of a
specific one dimensional translationally invariant system on continuum are
tuned so that the energy of the system resembles the kinetic energy of a system
on a one dimensional lattice. In particular, it is shown that the parameters
could be tuned so that while the width of the first energy band and its
position are kept finite, the energy gap between the first energy band and the
next energy band go to infinity, so that effectively only the first energy band
is relevant.

  Theory and Applications (4ICMCTA), Palmela, Portugal, September 2014",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Batch codes are a family of codes that represent a distributed storage system
(DSS) of $n$ nodes so that any batch of $t$ data symbols can be retrieved by
reading at most one symbol from each node. Fractional repetition codes are a
family of codes for DSS that enable efficient uncoded repairs of failed nodes.
In this work these two families of codes are combined to obtain fractional
repetition batch (FRB) codes which provide both uncoded repairs and parallel
reads of subsets of stored symbols. In addition, new batch codes which can
tolerate node failures are considered. This new family of batch codes is called
erasure combinatorial batch codes (ECBCs). Some properties of FRB codes and
ECBCs and examples of their constructions based on transversal designs and
affine planes are presented.
