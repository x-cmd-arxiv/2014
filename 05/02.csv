and experimental objectives. These favorable results have been attributed to
advantageous properties of the corresponding control landscapes, which are free
from local optima if three conditions are met: (1) the quantum system is
controllable, (2) the Jacobian of the map from the control field to the
evolution operator is full rank, and (3) the control field is not constrained.
This paper explores how gradient searches for globally optimal control fields
are affected by deviations from assumption (2). In some quantum control
problems, so-called singular critical points, at which the Jacobian is
rank-deficient, may exist on the landscape. Using optimal control simulations,
we show that search failure is only observed when a singular critical point is
also a second-order trap, which occurs if the control problem meets additional
conditions involving the system Hamiltonian and/or the control objective. All
known second-order traps occur at constant control fields, and we also show
that they only affect searches that originate very close to them. As a result,
even when such traps exist on the control landscape, they are unlikely to
affect well-designed gradient optimizations under realistic searching
conditions.

Therefore a number

Nevertheless, none of these protocols prevents inferences from the result.
Goodrich has shown that this resulting information is sufficient for an
effective attack on genome databases. In this paper we present an approach that
can detect and mitigate such an attack on encrypted messages while still
preserving the privacy of both parties. Note that randomization, e.g.~using
differential privacy, will almost certainly destroy the utility of the matching
result. We combine two known cryptographic primitives -- secure computation of
the edit distance and fuzzy commitments -- in order to prevent submission of
similar genome sequences. Particularly, we contribute an efficient
zero-knowledge proof that the same input has been used in both primitives. We
show that using our approach it is feasible to preserve privacy in genome

astrophysical r-process. Most of these rates still rely on theoretical
modeling. However, modern radioactive ion-beam facilities have allowed to
measure beta half lives of some nuclei on or close to the r-process path. These
data indicate that r-process half lives are in general shorter than anticipated
in the standard theoretical predictions based on the Finite Range Droplet Model
(FRDM). The data have also served as important constraints for improved
predictions of half lives based on continuum QRPA calculations on top of the
energy-density functional theory. Although these calculations are yet limited
to spherical nuclei, they include the important r-process waiting point nuclei
close to and at the neutron magic numbers $N=50, 82$ and 126. We have studied
the impact of these new experimental and theoretical half lives on r-process
nucleosynthesis within the two astrophysical sites currently favored for the r
process: the neutrino-driven wind from the freshly born neutron star in a
supernova explosion and the ejecta of the merger of two neutron stars. We find
that the, in general, shorter beta decay rates have several important effects
on the dynamics of r-process nucleosynthesis. At first, the matter flow
overcomes the waiting point nuclei faster enhancing matter transport to heavier
nuclei. Secondly, the shorter half lives result also in a faster consumption of
neutrons resulting in important changes of the conditions at freeze-out with
consequences for the final r-process abundances. Besides these global effects
on the r-process dynamics, the new half lives also lead to some local changes
in the abundance distributions.

tensor perturbations can be generated during a contracting phase before the
radiation dominated epoch if the theory of gravity is modified by the
scalar-tensor theory at that time. The scale-invariance protects the tensor
perturbations from suppressing at large scales and they may have significant
amplitudes to fit BICEP2's result. We construct a model to achieve this purpose
and show that the universe can bounce to the hot big bang after long time
contraction, and at almost the same time the theory of gravity approaches to
general relativity through stabilizing the scalar field. Theoretically, such
models are dual to inflation models if we change to the frame in which the
theory of gravity is general relativity. Dual models are related by the
conformal transformations. With this study we reinforce the point that only the
conformal invariant quantities such as the scalar and tensor perturbations are
physical. How did the background evolve before the radiation time depends on
the frame and has no physical meaning. It is impossible to distinguish

Raman-induced hopping mimics the effect of a large magnetic field. In the
mean-field limit, where there are large numbers of particles per site, this
maps onto a uniformly frustrated two-leg ladder classical spin model. The net
particle current always vanishes in the ground state, but generically there is
a finite ""chiral current"", corresponding to equal and opposite flow on the two
legs. We vary the strength of the hopping across the rungs of the ladder and
the interaction between the bosons. We find three phases: (1) A ""saturated
chiral current phase"" (SCCP), where the density is uniform and the chiral
current is simply related to the strength of the magnetic field. In this state
the only broken symmetry is the $U(1)$ condensate phase. (2) A ""biased ladder
phase"" (BLP), where the density is higher on one leg than the other. The fluid
velocity is higher on the lower density leg, so the net current is zero. In
addition to the $U(1)$ condensate phase, this has a broken $Z_2$ reflection
symmetry. (3) A ""modulated density phase"" (MDP), where the atomic density is
modulated along the ladder. In addition to the $U(1)$ condensate phase, this
has a second broken $U(1)$ symmetry corresponding to translations of the
density wave. We further study the fluctuations of the condensate in the BLP,
finding a roton-maxon like excitation spectrum. Decreasing the hopping along
the rungs softens the spectrum. As the energy of the ""roton"" reaches to zero,
the BLP becomes unstable. We describe the experimental signatures of these
phases, including the response to changing the frequency of the Raman

offense and defense, almost all of the sport's conventional metrics are
designed to summarize offensive play. As a result, player valuations are
largely based on offensive performances and to a much lesser degree on
defensive ones. Steals, blocks and defensive rebounds provide only a limited
summary of defensive effectiveness, yet they persist because they summarize
salient events that are easy to observe. Due to the inefficacy of traditional
defensive statistics, the state of the art in defensive analytics remains
qualitative, based on expert intuition and analysis that can be prone to human
biases and imprecision. Fortunately, emerging optical player tracking systems
have the potential to enable a richer quantitative characterization of
basketball performance, particularly defensive performance. Unfortunately, due
to computational and methodological complexities, that potential remains unmet.
This paper attempts to fill this void, combining spatial and spatio-temporal
processes, matrix factorization techniques and hierarchical regression models
with player tracking data to advance the state of defensive analytics in the
NBA. Our approach detects, characterizes and quantifies multiple aspects of
defensive play in basketball, supporting some common understandings of
defensive effectiveness, challenging others and opening up many new insights
into the defensive elements of basketball.

achieve their best performance with strong regularization, well beyond Bayesian
expectations, an empirical fact that is poorly understood. In this work, we
study the influence of pseudo-count and $L_2$-norm regularization schemes on
the quality of inferred Ising or Potts interaction networks from correlation
data within the MF approximation. We argue, based on the analysis of small
systems, that the optimal value of the regularization strength remains finite
even if the sampling noise tends to zero, in order to correct for systematic
biases introduced by the MF approximation. Our claim is corroborated by
extensive numerical studies of diverse model systems and by the analytical
study of the $m$-component spin model, for large but finite $m$. Additionally
we find that pseudo-count regularization is robust against sampling noise, and
often outperforms $L_2$-norm regularization, particularly when the underlying
network of interactions is strongly heterogeneous. Much better performances are
generally obtained for the Ising model than for the Potts model, for which only
couplings incoming onto medium-frequency symbols are reliably inferred.

To address these challenges we archive long-surveillance video through
lightweight processing based on low-level local spatio-temporal extraction of
motion and object features. These are then hashed into an inverted index using
locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). This local approach allows for query
flexibility as well as leads to significant gains in compression. Our second
task is to extract partial matches to the user-created query and assembles them
into full matches using Dynamic Programming (DP). DP exploits causality to
assemble the indexed low level features into a video segment which matches the
query route. We examine CCTV and Airborne footage, whose low contrast makes
motion extraction more difficult. We generate robust motion estimates for
Airborne data using a tracklets generation algorithm while we use Horn and
Schunck approach to generate motion estimates for CCTV. Our approach handles
long routes, low contrasts and occlusion. We derive bounds on the rate of false

re-assess both the method for computing and for implementing T(tau) relations,
and the assumptions they rest on. We develop a formulation for proper and
consistent evaluation of T(tau) relations from arbitrary 1D or 3D stellar
atmospheres, and for their implementation in stellar structure and evolution
models. We extract radiative T(tau) relations, as described by our new
formulation, from 3D simulations of convection in deep stellar atmospheres of
late-type stars from dwarfs to giants. These simulations employ realistic
opacities and equation of state, and account for line-blanketing. For
comparison, we also extract T(tau) relations from 1D MARCS model atmospheres
using the same formulation. T(tau)-relations from our grid of 3D convection
simulations display a larger range of behaviours with surface gravity, compared
with those of conventional theoretical 1D hydrostatic atmosphere models. Based
on this, we recommend no longer to use scaled solar T(tau) relations. Files
with T(tau) relations for our grid of simulations are made available to the

roughness of the S/F interfaces. The latter does not exceed 1 nm, showing the
high quality of the S/F interface. Using SQUID and a mutual inductance setup we
determined the superconducting transition temperatures of the samples, which
are in agreement with the literature data. Using of PNR for the single S layer
allowed to determine the screening length lambda of the superconducting layer,
lambda = 120 nm. This value is higher than the London penetration depth for
pure niobium which may indicate that the superconductor is in the dirty limit.
PNR and SQUID studies of magnetic properties of the CuNi layer have shown the
presence of ferromagnetism in all investigated samples.

of cosmological distances, but our continuing lack of concrete knowledge about
their progenitor stars is both a matter of debate and a source of systematic
error. In our attempts to answer this question, we presented unambiguous
evidence that LMC SNR 0509-67.5, the remnant of an SN Ia that exploded in the
Large Magellanic Cloud 400 +/- 50 years ago, did not have any point sources
(stars) near the site of the original supernova explosion, from which we
concluded that this particular supernova must have had a progenitor system
consisting of two white dwarfs (Schaefer & Pagnotta 2012). There is, however,
evidence of nebulosity near the center of the remnant, which could have been
left over detritus from the less massive WD, or could have been a background
galaxy unrelated to the supernova explosion. We obtained long-slit spectra of
the central nebulous region using GMOS on Gemini South to determine which of
these two possibilities is correct. The spectra show H-alpha emission at a
redshift of z = 0.031, which implies that the nebulosity in the center of LMC
SNR 0509-67.5 is a background galaxy, unrelated to the supernova.

protocol by successfully reproducing the known putative optimal packings of
congruent copies of regular pentagons and octagons, then employ it to suggest
dense packing arrangements of congruent copies of certain families of concave
crosses, convex and concave curved triangles (incorporating shapes resembling
the Mercedes-Benz logo), and ""moon-like"" shapes. Analytical constructions are
determined subsequently to obtain the densest known packings of these particle

convex and concave particles with central symmetry are achieved by their
corresponding optimal Bravais lattice packings; for particles lacking central
symmetry, the densest packings obtained are non-lattice periodic packings,
which are consistent with recently-proposed general organizing principles for
hard particles. Moreover, we find that the densest known packings of certain
curved triangles are periodic with a four-particle basis, and we find that the

  In this paper we study a large class of hyperball (hypersphere) packings in
$3$-dimensional hyperbolic space that can be derived from truncated simplex
tilings (e.g. \cite{S14}, \cite{MPSz}). It is clear, that in order to get a

determine the density upper bound locally, e.g. in truncated simplices.
  Thus we study hyperball packings in truncated simplices, i.e. truncated
tetrahedra and prove that if the truncated tetrahedron is regular, then the
density of the densest packing is $\approx 0.86338$. This is larger than the
B\""or\""oczky-Florian density upper bound for balls and horoballs (horospheres)

  Moreover, we show that the densest known hyperball packing, related to the

total integrity is often, in fact, an unrealistic assumption and violations to

differently from the traditional ones, relies on not necessarily valid semantic

by applying data mining techniques. Query optimization that leverages invalid
semantic knowledge cannot guarantee the semantic equivalence between the
original user's query and its rewriting: thus a query optimized by our approach
yields approximate answers that can be provided to the users whenever fast but
possibly partial responses are required. Also, we evaluate the impact of use of
invalid semantic knowledge in the rewriting of a query by computing a measure
of the quality of the answer returned to the user, and we rely on the recent
theory of Belief Logic Programming to deal with the presence of possible
correlation in the semantic knowledge used in the rewriting.

about genuine quantum effects and their difference to classical physics. On one
hand, entanglement theory provides the tools to quantify correlations in
information processing and many results have been obtained to discriminate
useful entanglement, which can be distilled to a pure form, from bound
entanglement, being of limited use in many applications. On the other hand, for
discriminating quantum phenomena from their classical counterparts,
Schr\""odinger and Bell introduced the notions of steering and local hidden
variable models. We provide a method to generate systematically bound entangled
quantum states which can still be used for steering and therefore to rule out
local hidden state models. This sheds light on the relations between the
various views on quantum correlations and disproves a widespread conjecture
known as the stronger Peres conjecture. For practical applications, it implies
that even the weakest form of entanglement can be certified in a semi-device
independent way.

TLS characterization, which has previously been limited to TLSs within (thin)
Josephson tunneling barriers made from aluminum oxide. Here we report on the
measurement of an individual TLS within the capacitor of a lumped-element LC

dielectric (80 $\mu$m$^{3}$), even with a moderate dielectric thickness (250
nm), we achieve the strong coupling regime as evidenced by the vacuum Rabi
splitting observed in the cavity spectrum. A TLS with a coherence time of 3.2
$\mu$s was observed in a film of silicon nitride as analyzed with a
Jaynes-Cummings spectral model, which is larger than seen from superconducting
qubits. As the drive power is increased, we observe an unusual but explicable
set of continuous and discrete crossovers from the vacuum Rabi split

consistent with the optical center of the southern galaxy (Mrk 709 S), while no
evidence for an active BH is seen in the northern galaxy (Mrk 709 N). We derive
stellar masses of M ~ 2.5 x 10^9 Msun and M ~ 1.1 x 10^9 Msun for Mrk 709 S and
Mrk 709 N, respectively, and present an analysis of the SDSS spectrum of the

most metal-poor galaxies with evidence for an active galactic nucleus.
Moreover, this discovery adds to the growing body of evidence that massive BHs

($\langle$3D$\rangle$). We account for departures from LTE wherever possible.
We have scoured the literature for the best transition probabilities, partition

profiles for blends. Our final 3D+NLTE abundances are:
$\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{Na}}=6.21\pm0.04$,
$\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{Mg}}=7.59\pm0.04$,
$\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{Al}}=6.43\pm0.04$,

statistical and systematic errors. Our results are systematically smaller than
most previous ones with the 1D semi-empirical Holweger & M\""uller model. The
$\langle$3D$\rangle$ model returns abundances very similar to the full 3D

run a large set of Monte Carlo simulations that describe the secular evolution
of a star-planet-star triple system including the effects from general
relativistic precession, stellar and planetary spin evolution, and tides. Our
simulations show that KL migration produces Hot Jupiters (HJs) with semi-major
axes that are generally smaller than in the observations and they can only
explain the observations if the following are both true: (i) tidal dissipation
at high eccentricities is at least $\sim 150$ times more efficient than the
upper limit inferred from the Jupiter-Io interaction; (ii) highly eccentric
planets get tidally disrupted at distances $\gtrsim 0.015$ AU. Based on the
occurrence rate and semi-major axis distribution of HJs, we find that KL
migration in stellar binaries can produce at most $\sim 20\%$ of the observed
HJs. Almost no intermediate-period (semi-major axis $\sim0.1-2$ AU) planets are
formed by this mechanism - migrating planets spend most of their lifetimes

contributions associated to the compact spatial slices can become important at
short scales and lift nonperturbative decays towards vanishing size. This class
of models (particularly in the static limit) can then provide a useful
framework for studying the question of the ultimate (meta)stability of an

with special emphasis on inflationary model building. D7-brane deformation
moduli are key players in two recently proposed inflationary scenarios: The
first, D7-brane chaotic inflation, is a variant of axion monodromy inflation
which allows for an effective 4d supergravity description. The second,
fluxbrane inflation, is a stringy version of D-term hybrid inflation. Both
proposals rely on the fact that D7-brane coordinates enjoy a shift-symmetric
Kahler potential at large complex structure of the Calabi-Yau threefold, making
them naturally lighter than other fields. This shift symmetry is inherited from
the mirror-dual Type IIA Wilson line on a D6-brane at large volume. The
inflaton mass can be provided by a tree-level term in the flux superpotential.
It induces a monodromy and, if tuned to a sufficiently small value, can give
rise to a large-field model of inflation. Alternatively, by a sensible flux
choice one can completely avoid a tree-level mass term, in which case the
inflaton potential is induced via loop corrections. The positive vacuum energy
can then be provided by a D-term, leading to a small-field model of hybrid
natural inflation. In the present paper, we continue to develop a detailed
understanding of the D7-brane moduli space focusing among others on
shift-symmetry-preserving flux choices, flux-induced superpotential in Type
IIB/F-theory language, and loop corrections. While the inflationary
applications represent our main physics motivation, we expect that some of our
findings will be useful for other phenomenological issues involving 7-branes in
Type IIB/F-theory constructions.

on the assumption of spherical symmetry. When applied to aspherical galaxy
clusters, the method yields mass estimates affected by the cluster orientation.
Here we employ mock redshift catalogues generated from cosmological simulations
to study the effect of clusters intrinsic shape and surrounding filamentary
structures on the caustic mass estimates. To this end, we develop a new method
for removing perturbations from large-scale structures, modelled as the
two-halo term, in a caustic analysis of stacked cluster data.
  We find that the cluster masses inferred from kinematical data of ~10^14 Msun
clusters observed along the major axis are larger than masses from those
observed along the minor axis by a factor of 1.7 within the virial radius,
increasing to 1.8 within three virial radii. This discrepancy increases by 20%
for the most massive clusters. In addition a smaller but still significant mass
discrepancy arises when filamentary structures are present near a galaxy
cluster.
  We find that the mean cluster mass from random sightlines is unbiased at all
radii and their scatter ranges from 0.14 to 0.17 within one and three virial
radii, with a 40% increase for the most massive clusters. We provide tables
which estimate the caustic mass bias given observational constraints on the

correlations linking black holes and their host galaxies. There has been much
scrutiny concerning the difficulty of obtaining accurate black hole
measurements, and rightly so; however, it has been taken for granted that

Face-on orientations correspond to systematically lower velocity dispersion

caution observers that the uncertainty of velocity dispersion measurements is
at least 20 km/s, and can be much larger for moderate inclinations. This effect
may account for some of the scatter in the locally measured M-$\sigma$

biplots are not adequate and techniques as Categorical Principal Component
Analysis (CATPCA) or Item Response Theory (IRT) for ordinal items should be
used instead.
  In this paper we extend the Biplot to ordinal data. The resulting method is
termed Ordinal Logistic Biplot (OLB). Row scores are computed to have ordinal
logistic responses along the dimensions and column parameters produce logistic
response surfaces that, projected onto the space spanned by the row scores,
define a linear biplot. A proportional odds model is used, obtaining a
multidimensional model known as graded response model in the Item Response
Theory literature. We study the geometry of such a representation and construct
computational algorithms for the estimation of parameters and the calculation
of prediction directions. Ordinal Logistic Biplots extend both CATPCA and IRT
in the sense that gives a graphical representation for IRT similar to the
biplot for CATPCA.

into a quiescent vacuum in which there are no dynamical quantum fluctuations.
Such fluctuations require either an evolving microstate, or time-dependent
histories of out-of-equilibrium recording devices, which we argue are absent in
stationary states. For a massive scalar field in a fixed de Sitter background,
the cosmic no-hair theorem implies that the state of the patch approaches the
vacuum, where there are no fluctuations. We argue that an analogous conclusion
holds whenever a patch of de Sitter is embedded in a larger theory with an
infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, including semiclassical quantum gravity
with false vacua or complementarity in theories with at least one Minkowski
vacuum. This reasoning provides an escape from the Boltzmann brain problem in
such theories. It also implies that vacuum states do not uptunnel to
higher-energy vacua and that perturbations do not decohere while slow-roll
inflation occurs, suggesting that eternal inflation is much less common than
often supposed. On the other hand, if a de Sitter patch is a closed system with
a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, there will be Poincare recurrences and
dynamical Boltzmann fluctuations into lower-entropy states. Our analysis does
not alter the conventional understanding of the origin of density fluctuations
from primordial inflation, since reheating naturally generates a high-entropy
environment and leads to decoherence, nor does it affect the existence of
non-dynamical vacuum fluctuations such as those that give rise to the Casimir
effect.

field model. This model for a first-order phase transition couples
non-conserved order parameter kinetics to salt diffusion. The evolution
equations are derived from a Landau-Ginzburg order parameter gradient dynamics
together with salinity conservation. The numerical solution of model equations
by an exponential time differencing scheme describes the time evolution of
phase separation between liquid water with high salinity and the ice phase with
low salinity. The numerical solution in one and two dimensions indicates the
formation of one dominant wavelength which sets the length scale of short-time
frozen structures. A stability analysis provides the phase diagram in terms of
two Landau parameters. It is distinguished an uniform ice phase, a homogeneous
liquid saline water solution and a phase where solidification structures can be
formed. The Landau parameters are extracted from the supercooling and
superheating as well as the freezing point temperature of water. With the help
of realistic parameters the distribution of brine inclusions is calculated and
found in agreement with the measured samples. The size of the ice domains
separating regions of concentrated seawater depends on salinity and temperature
and corresponds to the size of sea ice platelets obtained from a morphological
stability analysis for the solidification of salt water.

of producing a series of high-quality, well-documented, complete Data Releases
in a timely manner. However, the ""Atlas Image"" coadds that are part of the
recent AllWISE and previous data releases were intentionally blurred.
Convolving the images by the point-spread function while coadding results in
""matched-filtered"" images that are close to optimal for detecting isolated
point sources. But these matched-filtered images are sub-optimal or
inappropriate for other purposes. For example, we are photometering the WISE
images at the locations of sources detected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(York et al. 2000) through forward modeling, and this blurring decreases the
available signal-to-noise by effectively broadening the point-spread function.
This paper presents a new set of coadds of the WISE images that have not been
blurred. These images retain the intrinsic resolution of the data and are
appropriate for photometry preserving the available signal-to-noise. Users
should be cautioned, however, that the W3- and W4-band coadds contain artifacts
around large, bright structures (large galaxies, dusty nebulae, etc);
eliminating these artifacts is the subject of ongoing work. These new coadds,

SLEDs change on average from one peaking at $J \le 4$ to a broad distribution
peaking around $J \sim\,$6$-$7 as the IRAS 60-to-100 um color, $C(60/100)$,
increases. However, the ratios of a CO line luminosity to the total infrared
luminosity, $L_{\rm IR}$, show the smallest variation for $J$ around 6 or 7.
This suggests that, for most LIRGs, ongoing star formation (SF) is also
responsible for a warm gas component that emits CO lines primarily in the
mid-$J$ regime ($5 \lesssim J \lesssim 10$). As a result, the logarithmic
ratios of the CO line luminosity summed over CO (5$-$4), (6$-$5), (7$-$6),
(8$-$7) and (10$-$9) transitions to $L_{\rm IR}$, $\log R_{\rm midCO}$, remain
largely independent of $C(60/100)$, and show a mean value of $-4.13$ ($\equiv
\log R^{\rm SF}_{\rm midCO}$) and a sample standard deviation of only 0.10 for
the SF-dominated galaxies. Including additional galaxies from the literature,
we show, albeit with small number of cases, the possibility that galaxies,
which bear powerful interstellar shocks unrelated to the current SF, and
galaxies, in which an energetic active galactic nucleus contributes
significantly to the bolometric luminosity, have their $R_{\rm midCO}$ higher

analysis. Past successes, such as the Shannon-Nyquist theorem and recent
advances in frame theory, have relied heavily on the application of geometry
and analysis. The reliance on geometry and analysis means that the results are
geometrically rigid. There is a subtle interplay between the topology of the
domain of the functions being sampled, and the class of functions themselves.
Bandlimited functions are somewhat limiting; often one wishes to sample from
other classes of functions. The correct topological tool for modeling all of
these situations is the sheaf; a tool which allows local structure and
consistency to derive global inferences. This chapter develops a general
sampling theory for sheaves using the language of exact sequences, recovering
the Shannon-Nyquist theorem as a special case. It presents sheaf-theoretic
approach by solving several different sampling problems involving
non-bandlimited functions. The solution to these problems show that the
topology of the domain has a varying level of importance depending on the class
of functions and the specific sampling question being studied.

the proximity effects that emerge at the TI-SC interface. We construct a
low-energy effective theory that incorporates the proximity effect through an
interface contribution containing both normal and anomalous terms and an
energy-renormalization matrix. We show that the strength of the
proximity-induced gap is determined by the transparency of the interface and
the amplitude of the low-energy TI states at the interface. Consequently, the
induced gap is strongly band-dependent and collapses for bands containing
states with low amplitude at the interface. We find that states with energies
within the bulk TI gap have surface-type character and, in the presence of
proximity-induced or applied bias potentials, have most of their weight near
either the top or the bottom surface of the nanoribbon. As a result, single
interface TI-SC structures are susceptible to experiencing a collapse of the
induced gap whenever the chemical potential is far enough from the value
corresponding to the bulk TI Dirac point and crosses weakly coupled bands. We
also find that changing the chemical potential in single-interface structures
using gate potentials may be ineffective, as it does not result in a
significant increase of the induced gap. On the other hand, we find that
symmetric structures, such as a TI nanowire sandwiched between two
superconductors, are capable of realizing the full potential of TI-based

molecular cloud formation and evolution. However, their effects on subparsec to
100 parsec scales, leading to the formation of starless cores, is not well
understood. We investigate the prestellar core structure morphologies obtained
from analysis of the Herschel-SPIRE 350 $\mu$m maps of the Lupus I cloud. This
distribution is first compared on a statistical basis to the large scale shape
of the main filament. We find the distribution of the elongation position angle
of the cores to be consistent with a random distribution, which means no
specific orientation of the morphology of the cores is observed with respect to
a large-scale filament shape model for Lupus I, or relative to a large-scale
bent filament model. This distribution is also compared to the mean orientation
of the large-scale magnetic fields probed at 350 $\mu$m with the Balloon-borne
Large Aperture Telescope for Polarimetry (BLASTPol) during its 2010 campaign.
Here again we do not find any correlation between the core morphology
distribution and the average orientation of the magnetic fields on parsec
scales. Our main conclusion is that the local filament dynamics - including
secondary filaments that often run orthogonally to the primary filament - and
possibly small-scale variations in the local magnetic field direction, could be
the dominant factors for explaining the final orientation of each core.

structure, the double-spoke cavity belongs to TE mode structure and has smaller
transvers dimension compared with that of TH mode one. It can work at base
frequency as the DTL section, so that the cost and complexity of the RF system
will be much decreased, and the behaviors of the beam dynamics are also
improved significantly because of the low charge density and larger
longitudinal acceptance. Furthermore, because of the relatively longer
interactive length between charged particle and the electromagnetic field per
cell, it needs relatively less cell numbers and it has larger velocity
acceptance compared with the double frequency TH structures. The

such large simulations allow for very precise measurements of the cluster size

energy curves give critical cluster sizes, which agree well with independent
estimates based on the nucleation theorem. Using these results, we derive an
analytical formula and a new scaling relation for nucleation rates: $\ln J' /

$\eta$ is the dimensionless surface energy, and $J'$ is a dimensionless
nucleation rate. This relation can be derived using the free energy of cluster
formation at equilibrium which corresponds to the surface energy required to
form the vapor-liquid interface. At low temperatures (below the triple point),
we find that the surface energy divided by that of the classical nucleation
theory does not depend on temperature, which leads to the scaling relation and
implies a constant, positive Tolman length equal to half of the mean

a user's IP address, introducing significant latency and network efficiency
penalties compared to normal Internet usage. Rather than obfuscating network
identity through higher level protocols, we propose a more direct solution: a
routing protocol that allows communication without exposing network identity,
providing a strong foundation for Internet privacy, while allowing identity to
be defined in those higher level protocols where it adds value.
  Given current research initiatives advocating ""clean slate"" Internet designs,
an opportunity exists to design an internetwork layer routing protocol that
decouples identity from network location and thereby simplifies the anonymity
problem. Recently, Hsiao et al. proposed such a protocol (LAP), but it does not
protect the user against a local eavesdropper or an untrusted ISP, which will
not be acceptable for many users. Thus, we propose Dovetail, a next-generation
Internet routing protocol that provides anonymity against an active attacker
located at any single point within the network, including the user's ISP. A
major design challenge is to provide this protection without including an
application-layer proxy in data transmission. We address this challenge in path
construction by using a matchmaker node (an end host) to overlap two path
segments at a dovetail node (a router). The dovetail then trims away part of
the path so that data transmission bypasses the matchmaker. Additional design
features include the choice of many different paths through the network and the
joining of path segments without requiring a trusted third party. We develop a
systematic mechanism to measure the topological anonymity of our designs, and
we demonstrate the privacy and efficiency of our proposal by simulation, using
a model of the complete Internet at the AS-level.

today. DNA sequence motifs are becoming increasingly important in analysis of
gene regulation. Motifs are short, recurring patterns in DNA that have a
biological function. For example, they indicate binding sites for Transcription
Factors (TFs) and nucleases. There are a number of Motif Discovery algorithms
that run sequentially. The sequential nature stops these algorithms from being
parallelized. HOMER is one such Motif discovery tool, that we have decided to
use to overcome this limitation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new
methodology for Motif Discovery, using HOMER, that parallelizes the task.
Parallelized version can potentially yield better scalability and performance.
To achieve this, we have decided to use sub-sampling and the Map Reduce model.
At each Map node, a sub-sampled version of the input DNA sequences is used as
input to HOMER. Subsampling at each map node is performed with different
parameters to ensure that no two HOMER instances receive identical inputs. The
output of the map phase and the input of the reduce phase is a list of Motifs
discovered using the sub-sampled sequences. The reduce phase calculates the
mode, most frequent Motifs, and outputs them as the final discovered Motifs. We
found marginal speed gains with this model of execution and substantial amount
of quality loss in discovered Motifs.

The first part is an introduction to 1-summability. The definitions rely on the
formal Borel transform and the Laplace transform along an arbitrary direction
of the complex plane. Given an arc of directions, if a power series is
1-summable in that arc, then one can attach to it a Borel-Laplace sum, i.e. a
holomorphic function defined in a large enough sector and asymptotic to that
power series in Gevrey sense. The second part is an introduction to Ecalle's
resurgence theory. A power series is said to be resurgent when its Borel
transform is convergent and has good analytic continuation properties: there
may be singularities but they must be isolated. The analysis of these
singularities, through the so-called alien calculus, allows one to compare the
various Borel-Laplace sums attached to the same resurgent 1-summable series.In
the context of analytic difference-or-differential equations, this sheds light
on the Stokes phenomenon. A few elementary or classical examples are given a
thorough treatment (the Euler series, the Stirling series, a less known example
by Poincar\'e). Special attention is devoted to non-linear operations:
1-summable series as well as resurgent series are shown to form algebras which
are stable by composition. As an application, the resurgent approach to the
classification of tangent-to-identity germs of holomorphic diffeomorphisms in
the simplest case is included. An example of a class of non-linear differential
equations giving rise to resurgent solutions is also presented. The exposition
is as self-contained as can be, requiring only some familiarity with
holomorphic functions of one complex variable.

estimate the 21 cm signal from high redshift neutral hydrogen during the Epoch
of Reionisation (EoR) using interferometric data are typically computed
assuming a tracked observation, where the telescope pointing centre and
instrument phase centre are the same over the observation. Current low
frequency interferometers use aperture arrays of fixed dipoles, which are
steered electronically on the sky, and have different properties to
mechanically-steered single apertures, such as reduced sensitivity away from
zenith, and discrete pointing positions on the sky. Use of two additional
observing modes is encouraged: (1) zenith drift, where the pointing centre
remains fixed at the zenith, and the phase centre tracks the sky, and (2)
drift+shift, where the telescope uses discrete pointing centres, and the sky
drifts during each pointing. The coherence of measurements in these modes
dictates the optimal reduction in thermal noise by combination of coherent
modes, and the reduction in cosmic variance by combination of incoherent modes
(views of different patches of the sky). The balance between these noise
components provides one measure for the utility of these three modes for
measuring a statistical EoR signature. We provide a general framework for
estimating the uncertainty in the power spectrum for a given observing mode,
telescope beam shape, and antenna distribution. We apply this framework to the
Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) using an analysis of the 2D and 1D power
spectra for 900 hours of observing. We demonstrate that zenith drift scans can
yield marginally lower uncertainty in the signal power compared with tracked
scans for the MWA EoR experiment.

superspin glass (SSG) and dilute antiferromagnet in a field (DAFF) coexist at
the interface between ferromagnetic Bi$_2$Fe$_4$O$_9$ and antiferromagnetic
BiFeO$_3$. The coexisting SSG and DAFF combine to form a local spin texture
which gives rise to a path-dependent exchange bias below the spin freezing
temperature ($\sim$29K). The exchange bias varies depending on the protocol or
path followed in tracing the hysteresis loop. The exchange bias has been
observed below blocking temperature (T$_B$$\sim$60K) of the superparamagnetic
Bi$_2$Fe$_4$O$_9$. The conventional exchange bias (CEB) increases
nonmonotonically as temperature decreases. The magnitude of both exchange bias
(H$_E$) and coercivity (H$_C$) increase with decrease in temperature and are
found to be asymmetric below 20K depending on the path followed in tracing the
hysteresis loop and bias field. The local spin texture at the interface between
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic particles generates a nonswitchable
unidirectional anisotropy along the negative direction of the applied field.
The influence of this texture also shows up in ""asymmetric"" jumps in the
hysteresis loop at 2 K which smears off at higher temperature. The role of the
interface spin texture in yielding the path dependency of exchange bias is thus
clearly delineated.

evolution of high grade gliomas - a lethal type of primary brain tumor -
through the interplay of different cellular phenotypes. We show how hypoxic
events, even sporadic and/or limited in space may have a crucial role on the
acceleration of the growth speed of high grade gliomas. Our modeling approach
is based on two cellular phenotypes one of them being more migratory and the
second one more proliferative with transitions between them being driven by the
local oxygen values, assumed in this simple model to be uniform. Surprisingly
even acute hypoxia events (i.e. very localized in time) leading to the
appearance of migratory populations have the potential of accelerating the
invasion speed of the proliferative phenotype up to speeds close to those of
the migratory phenotype. The high invasion speed of the tumor persists for
times much longer than the lifetime of the hypoxic event and the phenomenon is
observed both when the migratory cells form a persistent wave of cells located
on the invasion front and when they form a evanecent wave dissapearing after a
short time by decay into the more proliferative phenotype.
  Our findings are obtained through numerical simulations of the model
equations. We also provide a deeper mathematical analysis of some aspects of
the problem such as the conditions for the existence of persistent waves of

block-fading channel in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. The fading
process is assumed stationary within each block and to change independently
from block to block; furthermore, its realizations are not known a priori to
the transmitter and the receiver (noncoherent setting). A common approach to
analyzing the capacity of this channel is to assume that the receiver performs
matched filtering followed by sampling at symbol rate (symbol matched
filtering). This yields a discrete-time channel in which each transmitted
symbol corresponds to one output sample. Liang & Veeravalli (2004) showed that
the capacity of this discrete-time channel grows logarithmically with the SNR,
with a capacity pre-log equal to $1-{Q}/{N}$. Here, $N$ is the number of
symbols transmitted within one fading block, and $Q$ is the rank of the
covariance matrix of the discrete-time channel gains within each fading block.
In this paper, we show that symbol matched filtering is not a
capacity-achieving strategy for the underlying continuous-time channel.
Specifically, we analyze the capacity pre-log of the discrete-time channel
obtained by oversampling the continuous-time channel output, i.e., by sampling
it faster than at symbol rate. We prove that by oversampling by a factor two
one gets a capacity pre-log that is at least as large as $1-1/N$. Since the
capacity pre-log corresponding to symbol-rate sampling is $1-Q/N$, our result
implies indeed that symbol matched filtering is not capacity achieving at high
SNR.

observed in a few comets is ascribed to the presence of higher CO$_2$ and CO
relative abundances in the cometary coma. We aim to study the effect of CO$_2$
and CO relative abundances on the observed G/R ratio in comets observed at
large ($>$2 au) heliocentric distances by accounting for important production
and loss processes of O($^1$S) and O($^1$D) in the cometary coma. Recently we
have developed a coupled chemistry-emission model to study photochemistry of
O($^1$S) and O($^1$D) atoms and the production of green and red-doublet
emissions in comets Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp. In the present work we applied the
model to six comets where green and red-doublet emissions are observed when
they are beyond 2 au from the Sun. In a water-dominated cometary coma and with
significant ($>$10%) CO$_2$ relative abundance, photodissociation of H$_2$O
mainly governs the red-doublet emission, whereas CO$_2$ controls the green line
emission. If a comet has equal composition of CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, then ~50% of
red-doublet emission intensity is controlled by the photodissociation of
CO$_2$. The G/R ratio values and green and red-doublet line widths calculated
by the model are consistent with the observation. Our model calculations
suggest that in low gas production rate comets the G/R ratio greater than 0.1
can be used to constrain the upper limit of CO$_2$ relative abundance provided
the slit-projected area on the coma is larger than the collisional zone. If a
comet has equal abundances of CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, then the red-doublet emission
is significantly ($\sim$50%) controlled by CO$_2$ photodissociation and thus
the G/R ratio is not suitable for estimating CO$_2$ relative abundance.

the most popular family of mixture models for clustering and classification,
i.e., the Gaussian parsimonious clustering models (GPCM). Although the GPCM
family has been used for almost 20 years, selecting the best member of the
family in a given situation remains a troublesome problem. Likelihood ratio
tests are developed to tackle this problems. These likelihood ratio tests use
the heteroscedastic model under the alternative hypothesis but provide much
more flexibility and real-world applicability than previous approaches that
compare the homoscedastic Gaussian mixture versus the heteroscedastic one.
Along the way, a novel maximum likelihood estimation procedure is developed for
two members of the GPCM family. Simulations show that the $\chi^2$ reference
distribution gives reasonable approximation for the LR statistics only when the
sample size is considerable and when the mixture components are well separated;
accordingly, following Lo (2008), a parametric bootstrap is adopted.
Furthermore, by generalizing the idea of Greselin and Punzo (2013) to the
clustering context, a closed testing procedure, having the defined likelihood
ratio tests as local tests, is introduced to assess a unique model in the
general family. The advantages of this likelihood ratio testing procedure are
illustrated via an application to the well-known Iris data set.

expansion of the system away from strict commensurability as a function of

librations has been attained. We perform numerical simulations that show the
attainment of such resonant states focusing on the Kepler 60 system. The
results of the simulations confirm many of the scalings predicted by the
appropriate analytic solution. We go on to indicate how the results can be

its formation, we find that its present period ratios imply an upper limit on

is narrow and one condensate tends to kill the other. The phase diagram is
constructed for each model in terms of temperature and the ratio of charges of
two orders. We further compare the behaviors of some thermodynamic quantities,
and discuss the different aspects and identical ones between two models.

multiple scanning probe techniques when analyzing nanoscale samples. Here, we
analyze theoretically dual-probe setups with probe separations in the nanometer
range, i.e., in a regime where quantum coherence effects can be observed at low
temperatures. In a dual-probe setup the electrons are injected at one probe and
collected at the other. The measured conductance reflects the local transport
properties on the nanoscale, thereby yielding information complementary to that
obtained with a standard one-probe setup (the local density-of-states). In this
work we develop a real space Green's function method to compute the
conductance. This requires an extension of the standard calculation schemes,
which typically address a finite sample between the probes. In contrast, the
developed method makes no assumption on the sample size (e.g., an extended
graphene sheet). Applying this method, we study the transport anisotropies in
pristine graphene sheets, and analyze the spectroscopic fingerprints arising
from quantum interference around single-site defects, such as vacancies and
adatoms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the dual-probe setup is a useful tool
for characterizing the electronic transport properties of extended defects or
designed nanostructures. In particular, we show that nanoscale perforations, or
antidots, in a graphene sheet display Fano-type resonances with a strong
dependence on the edge geometry of the perforation.

reachability of given node sets. A well known solver of parity games -
Zielonka's algorithm - uses such attractor computations recursively. We here
propose new forms of attractors that are monotone in that they are aware of
specific static patterns of colors encountered in reaching a given node set in
alternating fashion. Then we demonstrate how these new forms of attractors can
be embedded within greatest fixed-point computations to design solvers of
parity games that run in polynomial time but are partial in that they may not
decide the winning status of all nodes in the input game.
  Experimental results show that our partial solvers completely solve
benchmarks that were constructed to challenge existing full solvers. Our
partial solvers also have encouraging run times in practice. For one partial
solver we prove that its run-time is at most cubic in the number of nodes in
the parity game, that its output game is independent of the order in which
monotone attractors are computed, and that it solves all Buechi games and weak
games.
  We then define and study a transformation that converts partial solvers into
more precise partial solvers, and we prove that this transformation is sound
under very reasonable conditions on the input partial solvers. Noting that one
of our partial solvers meets these conditions, we apply its transformation on

cosmological model, with zero curvature, for a universe composed uniquely by
collision-less gravitating point-particles. The result is not, as currently
thought, a null pressure Friedman model, but one that reproduces quite well the
dark phenomena.
  We assume that there exist three consecutive ages with this property, formed
by free atoms, stars and galaxies, respectively. Certainly, we are using a
highly idealized view of the very complicated process going from uncoupled
atoms to galaxies, but it allows us to obtain that the energy density at each
epoch is of the form $ \rho(a)=\frac{3H_0^2}{8\pi
G}\left(\frac{\Omega_{ba}(1+\alpha)}{a^3}+ f(a)\right) $, where $\alpha$ is a
constant, that we identify with the dark matter, and $f(a)$ a function of the
scale factor, which is zero at galaxy formation and \emph{practically constant
at the present epoch}, constant that we identify with the cosmological
constant.
  The parameters of our model are the baryonic density $ \Omega_{ba}$ and the
redshifts $ z""_i, z'_i, z_i $, corresponding to the effective decoupling of
atoms and radiation, the formation of stars and galaxies respectively. The
model sets a relation between the galaxy formation epoch and the amount of dark
matter and dark energy, e.g., galaxy formation at $z_i \approx 11$ produces
$\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.683$; and the function $f(a)$ predicts the begining of the
acceleration recently at redshift $z\approx 0.6 $, just as the $\Lambda CDM$
model. So, the dark phenomena could be related to a revision of the dynamical
description of a gas of collision-less gravitating particles.

evolution is discussed, in the context of galaxy formation accompanying the
rapid infall of primordial gas on the inner disk region, which can generate a
positive metallicity gradient, and the subsequent chemical evolution of the
disk, which results in a flattening effect of a metallicity gradient at later

  Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR 2014)",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most prominent tools for abstract argumentation is the Dung's
framework, AF for short. It is accompanied by a variety of semantics including
grounded, complete, preferred and stable. Although powerful, AFs have their
shortcomings, which led to development of numerous enrichments. Among the most
general ones are the abstract dialectical frameworks, also known as the ADFs.
They make use of the so-called acceptance conditions to represent arbitrary
relations. This level of abstraction brings not only new challenges, but also
requires addressing existing problems in the field. One of the most
controversial issues, recognized not only in argumentation, concerns the
support cycles. In this paper we introduce a new method to ensure acyclicity of
the chosen arguments and present a family of extension-based semantics built on
it. We also continue our research on the semantics that permit cycles and fill
in the gaps from the previous works. Moreover, we provide ADF versions of the
properties known from the Dung setting. Finally, we also introduce a
classification of the developed sub-semantics and relate them to the existing
labeling-based approaches.

agreement was obtained by including long range van der Waals interactions

two reactive channels, $\Gamma = \frac{[NH_2^+]}{[NH_2^+]+[NH_3^+]}$, is
relatively constant, $\Gamma\approx 0.3$, in the entire collision energy range

rationalised in terms of relative time scales of the reactant approach and the
molecular rotation. Isotopic differences between the $\mathrm{Ne}^*$ + NH$_3$

also provides the crucial information necessary for determining the dynamical

detection of the 10 micron silicate feature in the z=0.52 absorber toward the
quasar AO 0235+164. We present results from 2 follow-up programs using archival
Spitzer Space Telescope infrared spectra to study the interstellar silicate
dust grain properties in a total of 13 QASs at 0.1<z<1.4. We find clear
detections of the 10 micron silicate feature in the QASs studied. We also
detect the 18 micron silicate feature in the sources with adequate spectral
coverage. We find variations in the breadth, peak wavelength, and substructure
of the 10 micron interstellar silicate absorption features among the absorbers.
This suggests that the silicate dust grain properties in these distant galaxies
may differ relative to one another, and relative to those in the Milky Way. We
also find suggestions in several sources, based on comparisons with
laboratory-derived profiles from the literature, that the silicate dust grains
may be significantly more crystalline than those in the amorphous Milky Way
ISM. This is particularly evident in the z=0.89 absorber toward the quasar PKS
1830-211, where substructure near 10 micron is consistent with a crystalline
olivine composition. If confirmed, these grain property variations may have
implications for both dust and galaxy evolution over the past 9 Gyrs, and for
the commonly-made assumption that high-redshift dust is similar to local dust.
We also discuss indications of trends between silicate dust absorption strength
and both carbonaceous dust properties and gas-phase metal properties, such as
the gas velocity spread, determined from UV/optical spectra.
