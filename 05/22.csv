the nature of the fundamental electronic correlations that lead to the
pseudogap phenomenon. Here we use ultrashort light pulses to prepare a
non-thermal distribution of excitations and capture novel properties that are
hidden at equilibrium. Using a broadband (0.5-2 eV) probe we are able to track
the dynamics of the dielectric function, unveiling an anomalous decrease of the
scattering rate of the charge carriers in a pseudogap-like region of the
temperature ($T$) and hole-doping ($p$) phase diagram. In this region,
delimited by a well-defined $T^*_{neq}(p)$ line, the photo-excitation process
triggers the evolution of antinodal excitations from gapped (localized) to
delocalized quasi-particles characterized by a longer lifetime. The novel
concept of photo-enhanced antinodal conductivity is naturally explained within
the single-band Hubbard model, in which the short-range Coulomb repulsion leads
to a k-space differentiation between ""nodal"" quasiparticles and antinodal
excitations.

ionizing radiation field, higher ionization parameter, and higher N/O at a

galaxy along the z~2.3 star-forming BPT locus is surprisingly insensitive to
gas-phase oxygen abundance. The observed nebular emission line ratios are most
easily reproduced by models in which the net ionizing radiation field resembles
a blackbody with effective temperature T_eff = 50000-60000 K and N/O close to
the solar value at all O/H. We critically assess the applicability of
commonly-used strong line indices for estimating gas-phase metallicities, and
consider the implications of the small intrinsic scatter in the empirical

to its simplicity and predictive power. The key point of this model is the
nonminimal coupling to gravity in unitary gauge. As such, this theory is in
fact a scalar-tensor modification of gravity that needs to be studied also
below the energy scales of inflation. Motivated by this goal, we study in great
analytical and numerical detail the static and spherically symmetric solutions
of the equations of motion in the presence of standard baryonic matter, called
""Higgs monopoles"" and presented in 1305.2640. These particlelike solutions may
arise naturally in tensor-scalar gravity with mexican hat potential and are the
only globally regular asymptotically flat solutions with finite classical
energy. In the case when the parameters of the potential are taken to be the
ones of the standard model, we find that the deviations from general relativity
are extremely small, especially for bodies of astrophysical size and density.
This allows to derive a simplified description of the monopole, for which the
metric inside the spherical matter distribution can be approximated by the
standard metric of general relativity. We study how the properties of these
monopoles depend on the strength of the nonminimal coupling to gravity and on
the baryonic mass and compactness. An important and original result is the
existence of a mechanism of resonant amplification of the Higgs field inside
the monopole that comes into play for large nonminimal coupling. We show that
this mechanism might degenerate into divergences of the Higgs field that reveal
the existence of forbidden combinations of radius and baryonic energy density.

estimate the flux of the brightest point sources using a morphological
separation approach: point sources with known support and shape are separated
from diffuse emissions that are assumed to be sparse in the spherical harmonic
domain. This approach is compared on both WMAP simulations and data with the
standard local chi2 minimization, modelling the background as a low-order
polynomial. The proposed approach generally leads to 1) lower biases in flux
recovery, 2) an improved root mean-square error of up to 35% and 3) more
robustness to background fluctuations at the scale of the source. The WMAP
9-year point-source-subtracted maps are available online.

how we can justify the three-dimensionality of space . Although he explicitly
anticipates that this will demonstrate throughout the text, in fact, he merely
relate the dimensionality of the extension to the law of gravitation. Anyway,
this speculation went beyond Kant's Philosophy and had impact on the modern
discussion about dimensionality of space. Indeed, from the point of view of
physics, Kant's conjecture can be understood in the context of formulation of
classical fields of Newtonian theory of gravitation. However, some
philosophical points that led the young Kant did not succeed in proving the

diagnosis from a raw MCC/IMS measurement, several computational steps are
necessary, which so far have required manual interaction, e.g., human
evaluation of discovered peaks. We have recently proposed an automated pipeline
for this task that does not require human intervention during the analysis.
Nevertheless, there is a need for improved methods for each computational step.
In comparison to gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS) data, MCC/IMS
data is easier and less expensive to obtain, but peaks are more diffuse and
there is a higher noise level. MCC/IMS measurements can be described as samples
of mixture models (i.e., of convex combinations) of two-dimensional probability
distributions. So we use the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to
deconvolute mixtures in order to develop methods that improve data processing
in three computational steps: denoising, baseline correction and peak
clustering. A common theme of these methods is that mixture components within
one model are not homogeneous (e.g., all Gaussian), but of different types.
Evaluation shows that the novel methods outperform the existing ones. We
provide Python software implementing all three methods and make our evaluation

to dissipate strain/stress. We have also observed the formation of linear

firstly that macroscopic gravity is described by a metric theory such as
general relativity, secondly that the Lense-Thirring metric provides an

thirdly that the spin axis of a gyroscope is parallel displaced in spacetime,

limited to social networks, biological networks, communication networks,
emerging smart grids etc. is a topic of fundamental interest. To understand
influences of nodes in a network, a classical metric is centrality within which
there are multiple specific instances including degree centrality, closeness
centrality, betweenness centrality and more. As of today, existing algorithms
to identify nodes with high centrality measures operate upon the entire (or
rather global) network, resulting in high computational complexity. In this
paper, we design efficient algorithms for determining the betweenness
centrality in large scale networks by taking advantage of the modular topology
exhibited by most of these large scale networks. Very briefly, modular
topologies are those wherein the entire network appears partitioned into
distinct modules (or clusters or communities), wherein nodes within the module
(that likely share highly similar profiles) have dense connections between
them, while connections across modules are relatively sparse. Using a novel
adaptation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, and executing it over local
modules and over sparse edges between modules, we design algorithms that can
correctly compute the betweenness centrality much faster than existing
algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that leverage
modular topologies of large scale networks to address the centrality problem,
though here we mostly limit our discussions to social networks. We also provide
more insights on centrality in general, and also how our algorithms can be used
to determine other centrality measures.

comparison or combination of probes difficult. We show that the choice of
biasing model has a significant impact on cosmological parameter constraints
for a survey such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES), considering the 2-point
correlations of galaxies in five tomographic redshift bins. We find that
modelling galaxy bias with a free biasing parameter per redshift bin gives a
Figure of Merit (FoM) for Dark Energy equation of state parameters w_0, w_a
smaller by a factor of 10 than if a constant bias is assumed. An incorrect bias
model will also cause a shift in measured values of cosmological parameters.
Motivated by these points and focusing on the redshift evolution of linear
bias, we propose the use of a generalised galaxy bias which encompasses a range
of bias models from theory, observations and simulations, b(z) = c + (b_0 -
c)/D(z)^alpha, where parameters c, b_0 and alpha depend on galaxy properties
such as halo mass. For a DES-like galaxy survey we find that this model gives
an unbiased estimate of w_0, w_a with the same number or fewer nuisance
parameters and a higher FoM than a simple b(z) model allowed to vary in z-bins.
We show how the parameters of this model are correlated with cosmological
parameters. We fit a range of bias models to two recent datasets, and conclude
that this generalised parameterisation is a sensible benchmark expression of
galaxy bias on large scales.

explain astronomical observations through its gravitational effects on stars

imprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This indirect evidence
implies that DM accounts for as much as 84.5% of all matter in our Universe,
yet it has so far evaded all attempts at direct detection, leaving such
confirmation and the consequent discovery of its nature as one of the biggest
challenges in modern physics. Here we present a novel form of low-mass DM
$\chi$ that would have been missed by all experiments so far. While its large
interaction strength might at first seem unlikely, neither constraints from
particle physics nor cosmological/astronomical observations are sufficient to
rule out this type of DM, and it motivates our proposal for direct detection by
optomechanics technology which should soon be within reach, namely, through the
precise position measurement of a levitated mesoscopic particle which will be
perturbed by elastic collisions with $\chi$ particles. We show that a recently
proposed nanoparticle matter-wave interferometer, originally conceived for
tests of the quantum superposition principle, is sensitive to these collisions,

galaxies using a compilation of SFHs estimated from deep HST data and a
cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of the Local Group. The nearby dwarfs
show a wide diversity of star formation histories; from ancient systems that
have largely completed their star formation $\sim 10$ Gyr ago to young dwarfs
that have formed the majority of their stars in the past $\sim 5$ Gyr to
two-component systems characterized by the overlap of comparable numbers of old
and young stars. Taken as an ensemble, star formation in nearby dwarfs dips to
lower-than-average rates at intermediate times ($4<t$/Gyr $<8$), a feature that
we trace in the simulation to the effects of cosmic reionization. Reionization
heats the gas and drives it out of the shallow potential wells of low mass
halos, affecting especially those below a sharp mass threshold that corresponds
to a virial temperature of $\sim 2 \times 10^4 $ $\mathrm{K}$ at $z_{\rm
reion}$.
  The loss of baryons leads to a sharp decline in the star forming activity of
early-collapsing systems, which, compounded by feedback from early star
formation, empties halos of gas and leaves behind systems where a single old
stellar component prevails. In halos below the threshold at $z_{\rm reion}$,
reionization heating leads to a delay in the onset of star formation that lasts
until the halo grows massive enough to allow some of the remaining gas to cool
and form stars. Young stellar components therefore dominate in dwarfs whose
halos assemble late and thus form few stars before reionization. Two-component
systems may be traced to late mergers of individual examples of the two
aforementioned cases. The relative dearth of intermediate-age stars in nearby
dwarfs might thus be the clearest signature yet identified of the imprint of
cosmic reionization on the star formation history of dwarf galaxies.

appear naturally as a consequence of the strong coupling in the colour

to the ""quark-core"" contribution obtained using the Poincar\'e covariant

excellent agreement is obtained with the empirical nucleon form factors
(including the magnetic moments and radii) where pion loop corrections play a
critical role for $Q^2 \lesssim 1\,$GeV$^2$. Using charge symmetry, the nucleon
form factors can be expressed as proton quark sector form factors. The latter
are studied in detail, leading, for example, to the conclusion that the
$d$-quark sector of the Dirac form factor is much softer than the $u$-quark
sector, a consequence of the dominance of scalar diquark correlations in the
proton wave function. On the other hand, for the proton quark sector Pauli form
factors we find that the effect of the pion cloud and axialvector diquark
correlations overcomes the effect of scalar diquark dominance, leading to a
larger $d$-quark anomalous magnetic moment and a form factor in the $u$-quark

Models of photon-dominated regions (PDRs) still fail to fully
reproduce some of the observed properties, in particular the combination of the
intensities of different PDR cooling lines together with the chemical
stratification, as observed e.g. for the Orion Bar PDR. Aims. We aim to
construct a numerical PDR model, KOSMA-\tau 3D, to simulate full spectral cubes
of line emission from arbitrary PDRs in three dimensions (3D). The model is to
reproduce the intensity of the main cooling lines from the Orion Bar PDR and
the observed layered structure of the different transitions. Methods. We build
up a 3D compound, made of voxels (""3D pixels"") that contain a discrete mass
distribution of spherical ""clumpy"" structures, approximating the fractal ISM.
To analyse each individual clump the new code is combined with the KOSMA-\tau
PDR model. Probabilistic algorithms are used to calculate the local FUV flux
for each voxel as well as the voxel-averaged line emissivities and optical
depths, based on the properties of the individual clumps. Finally, the
computation of the radiative transfer through the compound provides full
spectral cubes. To test the new model we try to simulate the structure of the
Orion Bar PDR and compare the results to observations from HIFI/Herschel and
from the Caltech Submillimetre Observatory (CSO). In this context new Herschel
data from the HEXOS guaranteed-time key program is presented. Results. Our
model is able to reproduce the line integrated intensities within a factor 2.5

suggesting a concrete implementation of a beyond-Turing computer in a spacetime

satisfactorily overcome by the proposed method. We propose an efficient
spectral domain decomposition of the total fine scale displacement along with a
potent macroscale equation in the Laplace domain to eliminate the spurious
interfacial reflection. We use Laplace transform based spectral finite element

$\phi:X\to\{1,\dots,k\}$ of $X$ is distinguishing with respect to $\Gamma$ if
the only $\gamma\in \Gamma$ that fixes $\phi$ is the identity action. The
distinguishing number of the action $\Gamma$, denoted $D_{\Gamma}(X)$, is then
the smallest positive integer $k$ such that there is a distinguishing
$k$-coloring of $X$ with respect to $\Gamma$. This notion has been studied in a
number of settings, but by far the largest body of work has been concerned with
finding the distinguishing number of the action of the automorphism group of a
graph $G$ upon its vertex set, which is referred to as the distinguishing
number of $G$.
  The distinguishing number of a group action is a measure of how difficult it
is to ""break"" all of the permutations arising from that action. In this paper,
we aim to further differentiate the resilience of group actions with the same
distinguishing number. In particular, we introduce a precoloring extension
framework to address this issue. A set $S \subseteq X$ is a fixing set for
$\Gamma$ if for every non-identity element $\gamma \in \Gamma$ there is an
element $s \in S$ such that $\gamma(s) \neq s$. The distinguishing extension
number $\operatorname{ext}_D(X,\Gamma;k)$ is the minimum number $m$ such that
for all fixing sets $W \subseteq X$ with $|W| \geq m$, every $k$-coloring $c :
X \setminus W \to [k]$ can be extended to a $k$-coloring that distinguishes
$X$.
  In this paper, we prove that

$\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{R})$ is comprised of compositions of translations
and reflections. We also consider the distinguishing extension number of the

experimental method for detecting a collective universal witness, which is a

allows us to detect entanglement for any two-qubit mixed state and to establish
tight upper and lower bounds on its amount. A different element of this method
is the sequential character of its main components, which allows us to obtain
relatively complicated information about quantum correlations with the help of
simple linear-optical elements. As such, this proposal realizes a universal

  The 1-cocycle seems to be trivial on all loops for long knots which are not

composite knot, on the loop which consists of {\em dragging} a trefoil through
another trefoil and on the {\em scan-arc} for the 2-cable of the trefoil. The

parent population of ultra-relativistic particles found in astrophysical
sources and underlined the possibility of new scenarios/mechanisms crucial for
understanding the underlying astrophysical processes in nonthermal sources.
Aims. The follow-up X-ray (0.2 - 10 keV) observations on HESS J1507-622 are
reported, and possibilities regarding the nature of the VHE source and that of
the newly discovered X-ray sources are investigated. Methods.We obtained
bservations with the X-ray satellites XMM-Newton and Chandra. Background
corrections were applied to the data to search for extended diffuse emission.
Since HESS J1507-622 covers a large part of the field of view of these
instruments, blank-sky background fields were used. Results. The discovery of
several new X-ray sources and a new, faint, extended X-ray source with a flux
of ~6e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 is reported. Interestingly, a new, variable point-like
X-ray source with a flux of ~8e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 appeared in the 2011
observation, which was not detected in the previous X-ray observations.
Conclusions. The X-ray observations revealed a faint, extended X-ray source
that may be a possible counterpart for HESS J1507-622. This source could be an
X-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) remnant of the larger gamma-ray PWN, which is
still bright in IC emission. Several interpretations are proposed to explain

usually required in the laser systems with free-space optics to optimize the
beam. Despite these procedures, significant distortions of the laser beam have
been observed during the first two years of operation of the Gemini South
multi-conjugate adaptive optics system (GeMS). A beam shaping concept with two
deformable mirrors is investigated in order to provide automated optimization
of the laser quality for astronomical AO. This study aims at demonstrating the
correction of quasi-static aberrations of the laser, in both amplitude and
phase, testing a prototype of this two-deformable mirror concept on GeMS. The
paper presents the results of the preparatory study before the experimental
phase. An algorithm to control amplitude and phase correction, based on phase
retrieval techniques, is presented with a novel unwrapping method. Its
performance is assessed via numerical simulations, using aberrations measured
at GeMS as reference. The results predict effective amplitude and phase
correction of the laser distortions with about 120 actuators per mirror and a
separation of 1.4 m between the mirrors. The spot size is estimated to be
reduced by up to 15% thanks to the correction. In terms of AO noise level, this
has the same benefit as increasing the photon flux by 40%.

subwavelength-film regime that reveal the constraints that the ITO permittivity
must satisfy if perfect absorption is to be achieved. Then, to get a physical
insight on the perfect absorption properties, we analyze the eigenmodes of the
layered structure by computing both the real-frequency/complex-wavenumber and
the complex-frequency/real-wavenumber modal dispersion diagrams. These analyses
allow us to attribute the experimental perfect absorption behavior to the
crossover between bound and leaky behavior of one eigenmode of the layered
structure. Both modal methods show that perfect absorption occurs at a
frequency slightly larger than the ENZ frequency, in agreement with
experimental results, and both methods predict a second perfect absorption
condition at higher frequencies attributed to another crossover between bound
and leaky behavior of the same eigenmode. Our results greatly expand the list
of materials that can be considered for use as ultrathin perfect absorbers and
also provide a methodology for the design of absorber systems at any desired
frequency.

of nodes in this subset is sufficient to infer the opinion of the entire
network. We focus on two fundamental algorithmic problems: (i) given a subset
of the network, how to determine whether it is an IDS; (ii) how to construct a
minimum IDS. Assuming binary opinions and the local majority rule for opinion
correlation, we show that the first problem is co-NP-complete and the second
problem is NP-hard in general networks. We then focus on networks with special
structures, in particular, acyclic networks. We show that in acyclic networks,
both problems admit linear-complexity solutions by establishing a connection
between the IDS problems and the vertex cover problem. Our technique for
establishing the hardness of the IDS problems is based on a novel graph
transformation that transforms the IDS problems in a general network to that in
an odd-degree network. This graph transformation technique not only gives an
approximation algorithm to the IDS problems, but also provides a useful tool
for general studies related to the local majority rule. Besides opinion
sampling for applications such as political polling and market survey, the
concept of IDS and the results obtained in this paper also find applications in
data compression and identifying critical nodes in information networks.

arising from systematic uncertainties in halo mass functions and the residual
uncertainties in cosmological parameters. Ignoring any of these sources of

Additionally, we demonstrate that ignoring the significant covariance between

The resulting long-term movement predictions demonstrate improved accuracy

four radiation hydrodynamical simulations of star cluster formation that
resolve masses down to the opacity limit for fragmentation. The calculations
are identical except for their dust and gas opacities. Assuming dust opacity is
proportional to metallicity, the calculations span a range of metallicities
from 1/100 to 3 times solar, although we emphasise that changing the
metallicity has other thermodynamic effects that the calculations do not
capture (e.g. on the thermal coupling between gas and dust).
  All four calculations produce stellar populations whose statistical
properties are difficult to distinguish from observed stellar systems, and we
find no significant dependence of stellar properties on opacity. The mass
functions and properties of multiple stellar systems are consistent with each
other. However, we find protostellar mergers are more common with lower
opacities. Combining the results from the three calculations with the highest
opacities, we obtain a stellar population consisting of more than 500 stars and
brown dwarfs. Many of the statistical properties of this population are in good
agreement with those observed in our Galaxy, implying that gravity,
hydrodynamics, and radiative feedback may be the primary ingredients for
determining the statistical properties of low-mass stars. However, we do find
indications that the calculations may be slightly too dissipative. Although
further calculations will be required to understand all of the effects of

uncountably many `exotic' Banach algebras.
  We associate to each isometry of an $L^p$-space, a spectral invariant called
`spectral configuration', which contains considerably more information than its

the isometric isomorphism type of the Banach algebra that the isometry
generates together with its inverse.
  It follows from our analysis that these algebras are semisimple. With the
exception of $PF_p(\mathbb{Z})$, they are all closed under continuous
functional calculus, and their Gelfand transform is an isomorphism.
  As an application of our results, we show that Banach algebras that act on

Population inversion, bistable normal phases and the coexistence of
normal{superradiant phases are revealed by adjusting of the experimentally
realizable interaction strength and pump-laser frequency. For the negative
(effective) cavity-frequency we observe remark- ably an inverted quantum phase
transition (QPT) from the superradiant to normal phases with the increase of
atom-field coupling, which is just opposite to the QPT in the normal Dicke
model. The bistable macroscopic states are derived analytically in terms of the
spin-coherent-state variational method by taking into account of both normal

our model, a dynamic path network consists of an undirected path with positive
edge lengths, uniform edge capacity, and positive vertex supplies. Here, each
vertex supply corresponds to a set of evacuees. Then, the problem requires to
find the optimal location of $k$ sinks in a given path so that each evacuee is
sent to one of k sinks. Let x denote a k-sink location. Under the optimal
evacuation for a given x, there exists a (k-1)-dimensional vector d, called
(k-1)-divider, such that each component represents the boundary dividing all
evacuees between adjacent two sinks into two groups, i.e., all supplies in one
group evacuate to the left sink and all supplies in the other group evacuate to
the right sink. Therefore, the goal is to find x and d which minimize the
maximum cost or the total cost, which are denoted by the minimax problem and
the minisum problem, respectively. We study the k-sink location problem in
dynamic path networks with continuous model, and prove that the minimax problem
can be solved in O(kn) time and the minisum problem can be solved in O(n^2
min{k, 2^{sqrt{log k log log n}}}) time, where n is the number of vertices in
the given network. Note that these improve the previous results by [6].

odorants by firing bursts of action potentials called sharp events. A given
cell produces a sharp event at a fixed phase during the sniff cycle in response
to a given odor; different cells have different phases. The olfactory bulb
response to an odor is thus a sequence of sharp events. Here, we show that
sharp event onset is biased toward certain phases of the ongoing gamma
frequency oscillation. Thus, the signature of an odor is a discrete sequence.
The fact that this sequence is relatively short suggests a new class of ""brute

number of modules, each forming a persistent snapshot of what occurs in a
certain gamma cycle. Towards the end of the sniff, the collection of these
snapshots forms a spatial pattern that could be recognized by standard
attractor-based network mechanisms. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
solution with simulations of simple network architectures having modules that

compressive phase retrieval. In this work, we detail a novel, probabilistic

alternatives and play an important role in transportation planning, marketing
research and other applications. The mixed multinomial logit (MMNL) model is a
popular discrete choice model that captures heterogeneity in the preferences of
decision makers through random coefficients. While Markov chain Monte Carlo
methods provide the Bayesian analogue to classical procedures for estimating
MMNL models, computations can be prohibitively expensive for large datasets.
Approximate inference can be obtained using variational methods at a lower
computational cost with competitive accuracy. In this paper, we develop
variational methods for estimating MMNL models that allow random coefficients
to be correlated in the posterior and can be extended easily to large-scale
datasets. We explore three alternatives: (1) Laplace variational inference, (2)
nonconjugate variational message passing and (3) stochastic linear regression.
Their performances are compared using real and simulated data. To accelerate
convergence for large datasets, we develop stochastic variational inference for
MMNL models using each of the above alternatives. Stochastic variational
inference allows data to be processed in minibatches by optimizing global
variational parameters using stochastic gradient approximation. A novel
strategy for increasing minibatch sizes adaptively within stochastic
variational inference is proposed.

legitimate parties of a quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme adds noise to

080501 (2005)] to improve the security of certain QKD protocols. In this
article, the improvement yielded by local randomisation is derived for an
imperfect implementation of the BB84 QKD protocol, in which the source emits
four given but arbitrary pure states and the detector performs
arbitrarily-aligned measurements. Specifically, this is achieved by modifying
an approach to analysing the security of imperfect variants of the BB84
protocol against collective attacks, introduced in [Phys. Rev. A 88, 012331

improvement to the threshold channel noise, from 11\% to 12.41\%, is recovered
in the special case of an ideal BB84 implementation and becomes more pronounced
in the case of a nonideal source. Finally, the bound derived for the asymptotic
key rate, both with and without local randomisation, is shown to be tight with
the particular source characterisation used. This is demonstrated by the
explicit construction of a family of source states and optimal attacks for

on the degree, showing that it is at least
$1-\frac2q(\frac{1}{q}+\frac{1}{q^2}+\frac{2}{q^3})^n$ for $q\geq4$. We
conjecture that the density is at least
$1-\frac1q(\frac{1}{q}+\frac{1}{2q^2})^n$ for all $q$ and $n$, and confirm this

algorithm called IsfCyclic to test whether a matrix is `good', at a cost of
${\rm O}({\rm Mat}(n)\log n)$ field operations, where ${\rm Mat}(n)$ is an

particularly take the systematic errors of CMB measurements into account. Then,
we study the effects of the anisotropies of the rotation angle

and economic viability of today's cellular networks, and calls for novel
network architectures and communication solutions. Data offloading through
third-party WiFi or femtocell access points (APs) can effectively alleviate the
cellular network congestion in a low operational and capital expenditure. This
solution requires the cooperation and agreement of mobile cellular network
operators (MNOs) and AP owners (APOs). In this paper, we model and analyze the
interaction among one MNO and multiple APOs (for the amount of MNO's offloading
data and the respective APOs' compensations) by using the Nash bargaining
theory. Specifically, we introduce a one-to-many bargaining game among the MNO
and APOs, and analyze the bargaining solution (game equilibrium) systematically
under two different bargaining protocols: (i) sequential bargaining, where the
MNO bargains with APOs sequentially, with one APO at a time, in a given order,
and (ii) concurrent bargaining, where the MNO bargains with all APOs
concurrently. We quantify the benefits for APOs when bargaining sequentially
and earlier with the MNO, and the losses for APOs when bargaining concurrently
with the MNO. We further study the group bargaining scenario where multiple
APOs form a group bargaining with the MNO jointly, and quantify the benefits
for APOs when forming such a group. Interesting, our analysis indicates that
grouping of APOs not only benefits the APOs in the group, but may also benefit
some APOs not in the group. Our results shed light on the economic aspects and
the possible outcomes of the MNO/APOs interactions, and can be used as a
roadmap for designing policies for this promising data offloading solution.

the impact of a thermalized UFO on the ambient gas in the inner part of the

clumpy. In the former case all of the ambient gas is driven outward rapidly as
expected based on commonly used energy budget arguments, while in the latter
the flows of mass and energy decouple. Carrying most of the energy, the shocked
UFO escapes from the bulge via paths of least resistance, taking with it only
the low-density phase of the host. Most of the mass is however in the
high-density phase, and is affected by the UFO much less strongly, and may even
continue to flow inwards. We suggest that the UFO energy leakage through the
pores in the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) may explain why observed
SMBHs are so massive despite their overwhelmingly large energy production
rates. The multiphase ISM effects reported here are probably under-resolved in
cosmological simulations but may be included in prescriptions for active

Researchers have proposed security mechanisms that operate within such a

These mechanisms improve in security over previous techniques since the defense
system is no longer part of an operating system's attack surface. However, due
to constant transitions between the hypervisor and the operating systems, these

  In this paper we present HyperForce, a framework which allows the deployment

executes with the highest privileges and has control over all the software

usually end with the installation of a rootkit, a stealthy piece of software
running with kernel privileges. When a rootkit is present, no guarantees can be
made about the correctness, privacy or isolation of the operating system.
  In this paper we present \emph{Hello rootKitty}, an invariance-enforcing

a guest operating system against rootkits. \emph{Hello rootKitty} uses the idea
of invariance to detect maliciously modified kernel data structures and restore

registration of infrared (IR) Very Large Telescope adaptive optics images with
optical \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} images we unambiguously identify the
precise location of the nucleus of a sample of nearby, type 2 AGN. Dust
extinction maps of the central few kpc of these galaxies are constructed from
optical-IR colour images, which allow tracing the dust morphology at scales of
few pc. In almost all cases, the IR nucleus is shifted by several tens of pc
from the optical peak and its location is behind a dust filament, prompting to
this being a major, if not the only, cause of the nucleus obscuration. These
nuclear dust lanes have extinctions $A_V \geq 3-6$ mag, sufficient to at least
hide the low-luminosity AGN class, and in some cases are observed to connect
with kpc-scale dust structures, suggesting that these are the nuclear fueling
channels. A precise location of the ionised gas H$\alpha$ and
[\textsc{Si\,vii}] 2.48 $\mu$m coronal emission lines relative to those of the
IR nucleus and dust is determined. The H$\alpha$ peak emission is often shifted
from the nucleus location and its sometimes conical morphology appears not to
be caused by a nuclear --torus-- collimation but to be strictly defined by the
morphology of the nuclear dust lanes. Conversely, [\textsc{Si\,vii}] 2.48
$\mu$m emission, less subjected to dust extinction, reflects the truly, rather
isotropic, distribution of the ionised gas. All together, the precise location
of the dust, ionised gas and nucleus is found compelling enough to cast doubts
on the universality of the pc-scale torus and supports its vanishing in
low-luminosity AGN. Finally, we provide the most accurate position of the NGC

variations and multiperiodic pulsations from all historical data including the
Kepler observations. Detailed analyses of 2,922 minimum epochs showed that the
orbital period has varied through a combination with an upward-opening parabola
and two sinusoidal variations, with periods of $P_3$=649 d and $P_4$=2,154 d
and semi-amplitudes of $K_3$=193 s and $K_4$=49 s, respectively. The secular
period increase could be interpreted as a combination of the secondary to
primary mass transfer and angular momentum loss. The most reasonable
explanation for both sinusoids is a pair of light-travel-time effects due to
two circumbinary objects with projected masses of $M_3$=0.47 M$_\odot$ and
$M_4$=0.047 M$_\odot$. The third-body parameters are consistent with those
calculated using the W-D binary code. For the orbital inclinations higher than
43$^\circ$, the fourth component has a mass within the hydrogen-burning limit
of $\sim$0.07 M$_\odot$, which implies that it is a brown dwarf. A satisfactory
model for the Kepler light curves was obtained through applying a cool spot to
the secondary component. The results demonstrate that the close eclipsing pair
is in a semi-detached, but near-contact, configuration; the primary fills
approximately 93% of its limiting lobe and is larger than the lobe-filling
secondary. Multiple frequency analyses were applied to the light residuals
after subtracting the synthetic eclipsing curve from the Kepler data. This
revealed that the primary component of V404 Lyr is a $\gamma$ Dor type
pulsating star, exhibiting seven pulsation frequencies in the range of
1.85$-$2.11 d$^{-1}$ with amplitudes of 1.38$-$5.72 mmag and pulsation
constants of 0.24$-$0.27 d. The seven frequencies were clearly identified as
high-order low-degree gravity-mode oscillations which might be excited through
tidal interaction.

deduplication, which works by referring duplicate chunks of the latest backup
to those of existing backups. However, inline deduplication degrades restore
performance of the latest backup due to fragmentation, and complicates deletion
of ex- pired backups due to the sharing of data chunks. While out-of-line
deduplication addresses the problems by forward-pointing existing duplicate
chunks to those of the latest backup, it introduces additional I/Os of writing
and removing duplicate chunks. We design and implement RevDedup, an efficient
hybrid inline and out-of-line deduplication system for backup storage. It
applies coarse-grained inline deduplication to remove duplicates of the latest
backup, and then fine-grained out-of-line reverse deduplication to remove
duplicates from older backups. Our reverse deduplication design limits the I/O
overhead and prepares for efficient deletion of expired backups. Through
extensive testbed experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets, we show
that RevDedup can bring high performance to the backup, restore, and deletion
operations, while maintaining high storage efficiency comparable to
conventional inline deduplication.

use time-domain measurements to quantify the dissipation. We compare the
Q-factor obtained from the ring-down measurements to those obtained from the
thermal noise spectrum and from the frequency response of the driven device. In
few-layer and single-layer $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ resonators the two are in close
agreement, which demonstrates that the spectral line-width in $\mathrm{MoS_2}$
membranes at room temperature is limited by dissipation, and that excess

properties, the paper reports and discusses on the strand elongation of
disordered columnar phases, hexagonal or lamello-columnar, of small molecules
or polymers. The mechanical properties appear to be relevant to the length of
the columns of molecules compared to the thread length, instead of the usual
correlation length. When short, the column entanglement being taken into
account, the strand exhibits rather fluid properties that may even look like
nematic at a macroscopic scale. Then, the Plateau-Rayleigh instability soon
breaks the thread. However, the hydrodynamic objects being the columns instead
of the molecules, the viscosity is anomalously large. The observations show
that the strands of columnar phases are made of filaments, or fibrils, that
indeed are bundles of columns of molecules. They both explain the grooves and
rings observed on the antenna or bamboo-like strand profiles. On pulling a
strand, the elongation stress eventually exceeds the plasticity threshold, thus
breaking columns and filaments. Cracks, more exactly, giant dislocations are
thus formed. They change the strand thickness by steps of different
birefringence colours. Interestingly, adding a solute may drastically change
the effective viscosity of the columnar phase and its mechanical properties.
Some solutes as alcanes, exhibit lubricant and detangling properties, while
others as triphenylene, are quite anti-lubricant.

  for locally tame combinatorial manifolds","20 pages",,,,"math.GT math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a recent work [2] with Datta, we introduced the mu vector (with respect to
a given field) of simplicial complexes and used it to study tightness and lower
bounds. In this paper, we modify the definition of mu vectors. With the new
definition, most results of [2] become correct without the hypothesis of
2-neighbourliness. In particular, the combinatorial Morse inequalities of [2]
are now true of all simplicial complexes.
  As an application, we prove the following generalized lower bound theorem
(GLBT) for connected locally tame combinatorial manifolds. If $M$ is such a
manifold of dimension $d$, then for $1 \leq \ell \leq \frac{d-1}{2}$ and any
field $\mathbb{F}, ~ g_{\ell+1} (M) \geq \binom{d+2}{\ell+1}
\sum\limits_{i=1}^\ell (-1)^{\ell-i} \beta_i (M;\mathbb{F})$. Equality holds
here if and only if $M$ is $\ell$-stacked.
  We conjecture that, more generally, this theorem is true of all triangulated
connected and closed homology manifolds. A conjecture on the sigma vectors of
triangulated homology spheres is proposed, whose validity will imply this GLB
Conjecture for homology manifolds. We also prove the GLBC for all connected and
closed combinatorial 3-manifolds. Thus, any connected closed combinatorial
manifold $M$ of dimension three satisfies $g_2 (M) \geq 10 \beta_1
(M;\mathbb{F})$, with equality iff $M$ is 1-stacked. This result settles a
question of Novik and Swartz [6] in the affirmative.

shown, that Fermi surfaces of K_{1-x}Fe_{2-y}Se_2 are essentially different

discuss the electronic structure of several multiple-band superconductors,

very different from previously studies iron pnictides and chalcogenides. The

constituent equations along the light-cone direction. We also reduce the
equation satisfied by the entropy current of the relativistic theory and obtain
a consistent entropy current for the non-relativistic system (we call it
""canonical form"" of the entropy current). Demanding that the non-relativistic
fluid satisfies the second law of thermodynamics we impose constraints on
various first order transport coefficients. For parity even fluid, this is
straight forward; it tells us positive definiteness of different transport
coefficients like viscosity, thermal conductivity, electric conductivity etc.
However for parity-odd fluid, canonical form of the entropy current fails to
confirm the second law of thermodynamics. Therefore, we need to add two
parity-odd vectors to the entropy current with arbitrary coefficients. Upon
demanding the validity of second law, we see that one can fix these two
coefficients exactly.

proposed to complement the fast, but best-effort, nature of Hardware
Transactional Memory (HTM) with a slow, reliable software backup. However, the
fundamental limitations of building a HyTM with nontrivial concurrency between
hardware and software transactions are still not well understood.
  In this paper, we propose a general model for HyTM implementations, which
captures the ability of hardware transactions to buffer memory accesses, and
allows us to formally quantify and analyze the amount of overhead
(instrumentation) of a HyTM scheme. We prove the following: (1) it is
impossible to build a strictly serializable HyTM implementation that has both
uninstrumented reads and writes, even for weak progress guarantees, and (2)
under reasonable assumptions, in any opaque progressive HyTM, a hardware
transaction must incur instrumentation costs linear in the size of its data
set. We further provide two upper bound implementations whose instrumentation
costs are optimal with respect to their progress guarantees. In sum, this paper
captures for the first time an inherent trade-off between the degree of
concurrency a HyTM provides between hardware and software transactions, and the
amount of instrumentation overhead the implementation must incur.

their lack of long-range structural order. At the level of two-body structural
correlations, glassformers show no qualitative change upon vitrifying from a
supercooled liquid. Nonetheless the dynamical properties of a glass are so much
slower that it appears to take on the properties of a solid. While many
theories of the glass transition focus on dynamical quantities, a solid's
resistance to flow is often viewed as a consequence of its structure. Here we
address the viewpoint that this remains the case for a glass. Recent
developments using higher-order measures show a clear emergence of structure
upon dynamical arrest in a variety of glass formers and offer the tantalising
hope of a structural mechanism for arrest. However a rigorous fundamental
identification of such a causal link between structure and arrest remains
elusive. We undertake a critical survey of this work in experiments, computer
simulation and theory and discuss what might strengthen the link between
structure and dynamical arrest. We move on to highlight the relationship
between crystallisation and glass-forming ability made possible by this deeper
understanding of the structure of the liquid state, and emphasize the potential
to design materials with optimal glassforming and crystallisation ability, for
applications such as phase-change memory. We then consider aspects of the
phenomenology of glassy systems where structural measures have yet to make a
large impact, such as polyamorphism (the existence of multiple liquid states),
aging (the time-evolution of non-equilibrium materials below their glass
transition) and the response of glassy materials to external fields such as

astrophysics in the energy range 30 GeV-100 TeV, which will improve by about
one order of magnitude the sensitivity with respect to the current major arrays
(H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS). In order to achieve such improved performance,
for both the northern and southern CTA sites, four units of 23m diameter Large
Size Telescopes (LSTs) will be deployed close to the centre of the array with
telescopes separated by about 100m. A larger number (about 25 units) of 12m
Medium Size Telescopes (MSTs, separated by about 150m), will cover a larger
area. The southern site will also include up to 24 Schwarzschild-Couder
dual-mirror medium-size Telescopes (SCTs) with the primary mirror diameter of
9.5m. Above a few TeV, the Cherenkov light intensity is such that showers can
be detected even well outside the light pool by telescopes significantly
smaller than the MSTs. To achieve the required sensitivity at high energies, a
huge area on the ground needs to be covered by Small Size Telescopes (SSTs)
with a FOV of about 10 deg and an angular resolution of about 0.2 deg, making
the dual-mirror configuration very effective. The SST sub-array will be
composed of 50-70 telescopes with a mirror area of about 5-10 square meters and
about 300m spacing, distributed across an area of about 10 square kilometers.
We will focus on the innovative solution for the optical design of the medium
and small size telescopes based on a dual-mirror configuration. This layout
will allow us to reduce the dimension and the weight of the camera at the focal
plane of the telescope, to adopt SiPMs as light detectors thanks to the reduced
plate-scale, and to have an optimal imaging resolution on a wide FOV.

where the Higgs boson plays a role of the inflaton. In the minimal model, it
would be difficult to satisfy theoretical constraints from vacuum stability and
perturbative unitarity. These problems can be solved by considering multi-Higgs
models. In this talk, we discuss a Higgs inflation scenario in a radiative
seesaw model with an inert doublet, which originally has been proposed to
explain dark matter and neutrino masses. We study this model under the
constraints from the current data, and find parameter regions where additional
scalar bosons can play a role of inflatons. They satisfy the current data from
neutrino experiments, the dark matter searches and also from LEP and LHC. A
unique phenomenological prediction appears in the mass spectrum of inert scalar
bosons. We show that this scenario is challenging to be tested at the LHC, but
would be well testable at the International Liner Collider by measuring
endpoints of energy distribution of a two jet system from decay processes of
the inert scalar fields produced via pair production.

In addition to the gapless points (Weyl/Dirac nodes) in the bulk, the
three-dimensional Weyl/Dirac semimetals are also characterized by
""topologically protected"" surface state with Fermi arcs on their specific
surface. The Weyl/Dirac semimetals have attracted much attention recently they
provide a venue not only to explore unique quantum phenomena but also to show
potential applications. While Cd3As2 is proposed to be a viable candidate of a
Dirac semimetal, more experimental evidence and theoretical investigation are
necessary to pin down its nature. In particular, the topological surface state,
the hallmark of the three-dimensional semimetal, has not been observed in
Cd3As2. Here we report the electronic structure of Cd3As2 investigated by
angle-resolved photoemission measurements on the (112) crystal surface and
detailed band structure calculations. The measured Fermi surface and band
structure show a good agreement with the band structure calculations with two
bulk Dirac-like bands approaching the Fermi level and forming Dirac points near

of the unified chaotic system along with a gradual decrease in the commensurate
FO is capable of suppressing the chaotic fluctuations much earlier than that

parameter switching in nonlinear dynamical systems have been characterized
using the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and Shannon entropy. The effect of
choosing different simulation techniques for random parameter FO switched
chaotic systems have also been explored through two frequency domain and three
time domain methods. Such a noise-like random switching mechanism could be
useful for stabilization and control of chaotic oscillation in many real-world
applications.

be at the stage of quasi-spherical settling accretion onto slowly rotating
magnetized NS from the OB-companion winds. At this stage, a hot quasi-static
shell is formed above the magnetosphere, the plasma entry rate into
magnetosphere is controlled by (inefficient) radiative plasma cooling, and the
accretion rate onto the NS is suppressed by a factor of \sim 30 relative to the
Bondi-Hoyle-Littleton value. Changes in the local wind velocity and density can
only slightly increase the mass accretion rate (a factor of \sim 10) bringing
the system into the Compton cooling dominated regime and led to the production
of moderately bright flares (L_x\lesssim 10^{36} erg/s). To interpret the
brightest flares (L_x>10^{36}~erg/s) displayed by the SFXTs, we propose that a
larger increase in the mass accretion rate can be produced by sporadic capture
of magnetized stellar wind plasma. At sufficiently low accretion rates,
magnetic reconnection can enhance the magnetospheric plasma entry rate,
resulting in copious production of X-ray photons, strong Compton cooling and
ultimately in unstable accretion of the entire shell. A bright flare develops
on the free-fall time scale in the shell, and the typical energy released in an
SFXT bright flare corresponds to the mass of the shell. This view is consistent
with the energy released in SFXT bright flares (\sim 10^{38}-10^{40}~ergs),
their typical dynamic range (\sim 100), and with the observed dependence of
these characteristics on the average unflaring X-ray luminosity of SFXTs. Thus
the flaring behavior of SFXTs, as opposed to steady HMXBs, may be primarily
related to their low X-ray luminosity allowing sporadic magnetic reconnection
to occur during magnetized plasma entry into the magnetosphere.

systems, and their forms examined at short and long times. Various
one-dimensional systems are studied. Results of numerical simulations for the
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain are qualitatively similar to results for the harmonic
chain, and agree unexpectedly well with a simple description in terms of
linearized equations for damped fluctuating sound waves. Simulation results for
the alternate mass hard particle gas reveal that - in contradiction to our
earlier results [1] with smaller system sizes - the diffusion constant slowly
converges to a constant value, in a manner consistent with mode coupling
theories. Our simulations also show that the behaviour of the Lennard-Jones gas
depends on its density. At low densities, it behaves like a hard-particle gas,
and at high densities like an anharmonic chain. In all the systems studied, the
tagged particle was found to show normal diffusion asymptotically, with
convergence times depending on the system under study. Finite size effects show
up at time scales larger than sound traversal times, their nature being
system-specific.

on the disc accretion speed and accretion rate and on the wind mass loss rate

the emerging traffic demand from smart devices, but also because of the
dependence on the traditional unsustainable energy and the overall
environmental concerns. The urgent call for reducing power consumption while
meeting system requirements has motivated increasing research efforts on green
radio. In this paper, we investigate a new joint spectrum and power allocation
scheme for a cooperative downlink multi-user system using the frequency
division multiple access scheme, in which arbitrary M base stations (BSs)
coordinately allocate their resources to each user equipment (UE). With the
assumption that multi-BS UE (user being served by multi-BS) would require the
same amount of spectrum from these BSs, we conclude that when the number of
multi-BS UEs is limited by M-1, the resource allocation scheme can always
guarantee the minimum overall transmit power consumption while meeting the
throughput requirement of each UE and also each BS's power constraint. Then, to
decide the clusters of multi-BS UEs and the clusters of individual-BS UEs
(users being served by individual BSs), we propose a UE-BS association scheme
and a complexity reduction scheme. Finally, a novel joint spectrum and power
allocation algorithm is proposed to minimize the total power consumption.
Simulation results are presented to verify the optimality of the derived

categories. However, it is known to the field that semantic classes do not
necessarily correspond to a unique visual class (e.g. inside and outside of a
car). Furthermore, many of the feasible learning techniques at hand cannot
model a visual class which appears consistent to the human eye. These problems
have motivated the use of 1) Unsupervised or supervised clustering as a
preprocessing step to identify the visual subclasses to be used in a
mixture-of-experts learning regime. 2) Felzenszwalb et al. part model and other
works model mixture assignment with latent variables which is optimized during
learning 3) Highly non-linear classifiers which are inherently capable of
modelling multi-modal input space but are inefficient at the test time. In this
work, we promote an incremental view over the recognition of semantic classes
with varied appearances. We propose an optimization technique which
incrementally finds maximal visual subclasses in a regularized risk
minimization framework. Our proposed approach unifies the clustering and
classification steps in a single algorithm. The importance of this approach is
its compliance with the classification via the fact that it does not need to
know about the number of clusters, the representation and similarity measures
used in pre-processing clustering methods a priori. Following this approach we
show both qualitatively and quantitatively significant results. We show that
the visual subclasses demonstrate a long tail distribution. Finally, we show
that state of the art object detection methods (e.g. DPM) are unable to use the
tails of this distribution comprising 50\% of the training samples. In fact we
show that DPM performance slightly increases on average by the removal of this

problems. In CVC, training and test data are co-clustered and class-cluster
distributions are used to find the label of the test data. To determine an
efficient number of clusters, a Semi-supervised Hierarchical Clustering (SHC)
algorithm is proposed. Clusters are obtained by hierarchically applying two-way
NCut by using signs of the Fiedler vector of the normalized graph Laplacian. To
this end, a Direct Fiedler Vector Computation algorithm is proposed. The graph
cut is based on the data structure and does not consider labels. Labels are
used only to define the stopping criterion for graph cut. We propose clustering
to be performed on the Grassmannian manifolds facilitating the formation of
spectral ensembles. The proposed algorithm outperformed state-of-the-art
image-set classification algorithms on five standard datasets.

the relative importance of each input parameter (or combinations thereof) of a

decomposition methods leading to the well-known Sobol' indices are recognized

polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) to compute Sobol' indices has allowed to
alleviate the computational burden though. However, when dealing with large

in order to discard unimportant variables. The {\em derivative-based global

this paper we show how polynomial chaos expansions may be used to compute

derivation of derivatives of the orthonormal polynomials which enter PC
expansions. The efficiency of the approach is illustrated on two well-known

hole, it is shown that only some phantom black holes of both classes exhibit
critical phenomena. The two classes share a nonextremality, but special,
critical point where the transition is continuous and the heat capacity, at
constant charge, changes sign with an infinite discontinuity. This point yields
a classification scheme for critical points. It is concluded that the two
unstable and stable phases coexist on one side of the criticality state and
disappear on the other side, that is, there is no configuration where only one
phase exists. The sinh class has an extremality critical point where the
entropy diverges. The transition from extremality to nonextremality with the
charge held constant is accompanied by a loss of mass and an increase in the
temperature. A special case of this transition is when the hole is isolated
(microcanonical ensemble), it will evolve by emission of energy, which results
in a decrease of its mass, to the final state of minimum mass and vanishing
heat capacity. The Ehrenfest scheme of classification is inaccurate in this

thermal fluctuations, and this allows to estimate the exponents tau_p and
zeta_p associated with moments of dissipation fluctuations and velocity
fluctuations. This approach, initiated in an earlier note, is pursued here more
carefully. In particular we derive probability distributions at finite Reynolds
number for the dissipation and velocity fluctuations, and the latter permit an
interpretation of numerical experiments. Specifically, if p(z)dz is the
probability distribution of the radial velocity gradient we can explain why,
when the Reynolds number increases, log p(z) passes from a concave to a linear
then to a convex profile for large z as observed. We show that the central
limit theorem applies to the dissipation and velocity distribution functions,
so that a logical relation with the lognormal theory of Kolmogorov and Obukhov

that a Petrov-Galerkin formulation does not suffer from a significant loss of
accuracy, and still preserve the convergence order of the original multiscale
method. We also prove inf-sup stability of a PG Continuous and a Discontinuous
Galerkin Finite Element multiscale method. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
Petrov-Galerkin method can decrease the computational complexity significantly,
allowing for more efficient solution algorithms. As another application of the
framework, we show how the Petrov-Galerkin framework can be used to construct a
locally mass conservative solver for two-phase flow simulation that employs the
Buckley-Leverett equation. To achieve this, we couple a PG Discontinuous
Galerkin Finite Element method with an upwind scheme for a hyperbolic
conservation law.

instrument to measure fluxes for the [CII] 158 um emission line. Sources cover
a wide range of active galactic nucleus to starburst classifications, as
derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) strength measured with the
Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph. Redshifts from [CII] and line to continuum
strengths (equivalent width of [CII]) are given for the full sample, which
includes 18 new [CII] flux measures. Calibration of L([CII)]) as a star
formation rate (SFR) indicator is determined by comparing [CII] luminosities
with mid-infrared [NeII] and [NeIII] emission line luminosities; this gives the
same result as determining SFR using bolometric luminosities of reradiating
dust from starbursts: log SFR = log L([CII)]) - 7.0, for SFR in solar masses
per year and L([CII]) in solar luminosities. We conclude that L([CII]) can be
used to measure SFR in any source to a precision of ~ 50%, even if total source
luminosities are dominated by an AGN component. The line to continuum ratio at
158 um, EW([CII]), is not significantly greater for starbursts (median
EW([CII]) = 1.0 um) compared to composites and AGN (median EW([CII]) = 0.7 um),
showing that the far infrared continuum at 158 um scales with [CII] regardless
of classification. This indicates that the continuum at 158 um also arises
primarily from the starburst component within any source, giving log SFR = log
vLv(158 um) - 42.8 for SFR in solar masses per year and vLv(158 um) in erg per
sec.

most of the energy deposition expected from coherent scattering is well below
this level. The devices we discuss can be operated at a threshold of
approximately 30 eV, making them ideal for observing this signal. For example,
the number of coherent scattering events expected on a 52 gram CCD array

of 99% can be reached within three months for this kind of detector array.

To maximize the overall throughput while meeting the constraints imposed by the

deals usually with symbols that are bounded measurable functions on the domain

corresponding RI sensitivity of the air-ring type 2D annular PCs (APCs) have
been studied in detail. Such type of 2D PCs can easily and apparently improve
the RI sensitivity in comparison with conventional air-hole type 2D PCs that
have been widely studied in previous works. This is because the APCs can
naturally exhibit suppressed up edge of PBG that can strongly affect the final
RI sensitivity. In general, an enhanced sensing performance of as high as up to
2-3 times RI sensitivity can be obtained from pure 2D APCs. Such high RI
sensitivity is also available in three typical waveguides developed from pure
2D APCs. Furthermore, a new conception of dual-polarization RI biosensors has
been proposed by defining the RI sensitivity as the difference of crossing
relative sensitivity of up-edge PBG between different polarizations. Based on
pure 2D APCs, a dual-polarization RI biosensor with high RI sensitivity of
around 1190 nm/RIU in infrared range was also presented as an example.

is compact (radius <60 au) and asymmetric. The dust emission is well matched by
a truncated disk with outer radius of $\approx$50 au. The lack of
millimeter-sized particles outside the 60 au is consistent with radial drift of
particles of this size. The protoplanet candidate, identified in previous

critical value of a coupling, from those characteristic of a thermalising phase

a quantum phase transition in its ground-state in the limit of large size,
related to a first-order active-to-inactive phase transition in the stochastic
trajectories of an associated classical model of glasses. Our results here
suggest that this transition is present throughout the spectrum of the system

Observations from three viewpoints are used for as precise as possible

prominence loop 'jumps' laterally to the latitude lower than the latitude of
the originally southern endpoint. Thus, the endpoints reshuffled their
positions in the limb view. Although this behaviour could be interpreted as the

likely to be reconnection of the flux-rope field lines in its northern leg with
ambient coronal magnetic field lines rooted in a quiet region far from the

the filament before the eruption was stable for vertical displacements, but was
liable to violation of the horizontal equilibrium. This is unusual initiation

empirical test statistics for testing a simple null hypothesis when the vector
of parameters of interest are defined through a specific set of unbiased
estimating functions. This family of test statistics is based on a distance
between two probability vectors, with the first probability vector obtained by
maximizing the empirical likelihood on the vector of parameters, and the second
vector defined from the fixed vector of parameters under the simple null
hypothesis. The distance considered for this purpose is the phi-divergence
measure. The asymptotic distribution is then derived for this family of test
statistics. The proposed methodology is illustrated through the well-known data
of Newcomb's measurements on the passage time for light. A simulation study is
carried out to compare its performance with that of the empirical likelihood
ratio test when confidence intervals are constructed based on the respective
statistics for small sample sizes. The results suggest that the ""empirical
modified likelihood ratio test statistic"" provides a competitive alternative to
the empirical likelihood ratio test statistic, and is also more robust than the
empirical likelihood ratio test statistic in the presence of contamination in
the data. Finally, we propose empirical phi-divergence test statistics for
testing a composite null hypothesis and present some asymptotic as well as
simulation results for evaluating the performance of these test procedures.

scale flow of a conducting fluid in order to deduce mean-field properties of
the combined induction action of small scale eddies. We examine two different
flow patterns in the style of the G.O. Roberts flow but with a mean vertical
component and with internal fixtures that are modelled by regions with
vanishing flow. These fixtures represent either rods that lie in the center of
individual eddies, or internal dividing walls that provide a separation of the
eddies from each other. The fixtures can be made of magnetic material with a
relative permeability larger than one which can alter the dynamo behavior. The
investigations are motivated by the widely unknown induction effects of the
forced helical flow that is used in the core of liquid sodium cooled fast
reactors, and from the key role of soft iron impellers in the
Von-K\'arm\'an-Sodium (VKS) dynamo.
  For both examined flow configurations the consideration of magnetic material
within the fluid flow causes a reduction of the critical magnetic Reynolds
number of up to 25%. The development of the growth-rate in the limit of the
largest achievable permeabilities suggests no further significant reduction for
even larger values of the permeability.
  In order to study the dynamo behavior of systems that consist of tens of
thousands of helical cells we resort to the mean-field dynamo theory (Krause &
R\""adler 1980) in which the action of the small scale flow is parameterized in
terms of an $\alpha$- and $\beta$-effect. We compute the relevant elements of
the $\alpha$- and the $\beta$-tensor using the so called testfield method. We
find a reasonable agreement between the fully resolved models and the
corresponding mean-field models for wall or rod materials in the considered
range $1\leq \mu_r \leq 20$.

enhancing particle creation at small velocities. Since the non-relativistic

no length contraction or time dilation, we show that the effect vanishes in the

exponential distribution according to the Gutenberg-Richter relation. Two
alternatives are the truncated exponential distribution (TED) and the cut-off
exponential distribution (CED). The TED is frequently used in seismic hazard
analysis although it has a weak point: When two TEDs with equal parameters
except the upper bound magnitude are mixed, then the resulting distribution is
not a TED. Inversely, it is also not possible to split a TED of a seismic
region into TEDs of sub-regions with equal parameters except the upper bound
magnitude. This weakness is a principal problem as seismic regions are
constructed scientific objects and not natural units. We overcome it by the
generalization of the above-mentioned exponential distributions: the
generalized truncated exponential distribution (GTED). Therein, identical
exponential distributions are mixed by the probability distribution of the
correct cut-off points. This distribution model is flexible in the vicinity of
the upper bound magnitude and is equal to the exponential distribution for
smaller magnitudes. Additionally, the exponential distributions TED and CED are
special cases of the GTED. We discuss the possible ways of estimating its
parameters and introduce the normalized spacing for this purpose. Furthermore,
we present methods for geographic aggregation and differentiation of the GTED
and demonstrate the potential and universality of our simple approach by
applying it to empirical data. The considerable improvement by the GTED in
contrast to the TED is indicated by a large difference between the
corresponding values of the Akaike information criterion.

of the method in such applications.

with some of the most used trading strategies for forecasting the behavior of
real financial indexes. We also push forward our analysis by means of a
Self-Organized Criticality model, able to simulate financial avalanches in
trading communities with different network topologies, where a Pareto-like
power law behavior of wealth spontaneously emerges. In this context, we present
new findings and suggestions for policies based on the effects that random

  Domain","25 pages, 20 figures, accepted in VLDB",,,,"stat.ML cs.DS cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Real-world data typically contain repeated and periodic patterns. This
suggests that they can be effectively represented and compressed using only a
few coefficients of an appropriate basis (e.g., Fourier, Wavelets, etc.).
However, distance estimation when the data are represented using different sets
of coefficients is still a largely unexplored area. This work studies the
optimization problems related to obtaining the \emph{tightest} lower/upper
bound on Euclidean distances when each data object is potentially compressed
using a different set of orthonormal coefficients. Our technique leads to
tighter distance estimates, which translates into more accurate search,
learning and mining operations \textit{directly} in the compressed domain.
  We formulate the problem of estimating lower/upper distance bounds as an
optimization problem. We establish the properties of optimal solutions, and
leverage the theoretical analysis to develop a fast algorithm to obtain an
\emph{exact} solution to the problem. The suggested solution provides the
tightest estimation of the $L_2$-norm or the correlation. We show that typical
data-analysis operations, such as k-NN search or k-Means clustering, can
operate more accurately using the proposed compression and distance
reconstruction technique. We compare it with many other prevalent compression
and reconstruction techniques, including random projections and PCA-based
techniques. We highlight a surprising result, namely that when the data are
highly sparse in some basis, our technique may even outperform PCA-based
compression.
  The contributions of this work are generic as our methodology is applicable
to any sequential or high-dimensional data as well as to any orthogonal data
transformation used for the underlying data compression scheme.

targeted attacks has proven to be difficult. In recent years, virtualization
has received attention from security researchers who utilize it to harden
existing systems and provide strong security guarantees. This has lead to
interesting use cases such as cloud computing where possibly sensitive data is
processed on remote, third party systems. The migration and processing of data
in remote servers, poses new technical and legal questions, such as which
security measures should be taken to protect this data or how can it be proven
that execution of code wasn't tampered with. In this paper we focus on
technological aspects. We discuss the various possibilities of security within
the virtualization layer and we use as a case study \HelloRootkitty{}, a
lightweight invariance-enforcing framework which allows an operating system to
recover from kernel-level attacks. In addition to \HelloRootkitty{}, we also
explore the use of special hardware chips as a way of further protecting and
guaranteeing the integrity of a virtualized system.

or even disastrous consequences. One major factor influencing mistakes and
failures is complexity of such tasks, which has been studied extensively in
prior research. Another important issue which hardly received any attention is
the impact of both accidental and intended distractions on users performing
security-critical tasks. In particular, it is unclear whether, and to what
extent, unexpected sensory cues (e.g., auditory or visual) can influence user
behavior and/or trigger mistakes. Better understanding of the effects of
intended distractions will help clarify their role in adversarial models. As
part of the research effort described in this paper, we administered a range of
naturally occurring -- yet unexpected -- sounds while study participants
attempted to perform a security-critical task. We found that, although these
auditory cues lowered participants' failure rates, they had no discernible
effect on their task completion times. To this end, we overview some relevant
literature that explains these somewhat counter-intuitive findings.
  Conducting a thorough and meaningful study on user errors requires a large
number of participants, since errors are typically infrequent and should not be
instigated more than once per subject. To reduce the effort of running numerous
subjects, we developed a novel experimental setup that was fully automated and
unattended. We discuss our experience with this setup and highlight the pros
and cons of generalizing its usage.
