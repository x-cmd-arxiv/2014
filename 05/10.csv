regions of spacetime to be compact (that is, physically speaking, free from
sources of unpredictability such as infinities and singularities). Motivated by
this argument we consider the spacetimes with the compactly determined Cauchy
horizons (CDCHs), the defining property of which is the compactness of
$\overline{J^-(\EuScript U)}\cap J^+(\EuScript S_0)$, where $\EuScript U$ is an
open subset of the Cauchy horizon and $\EuScript S_0$ is a Cauchy surface of
the initial globally hyperbolic region $\ingh$. The following two facts are
established: 1) $\ingh$ has no globally hyperbolic maximal extension. This
means that by shaping appropriately a precompact portion of a globally
hyperbolic region one can \emph{force} the Universe to produce either a closed
causal curve, or a quasiregular singularity, whichever it abhors less; 2)
Before a CDCH is formed a null geodesic appears which infinitely approaches the
horizon returning again and again in the same --- arbitrarily small --- region.
The energy of the photon moving on such a geodesic increases with each passage,
or at least falls insufficiently fast. As a result, an observer located in the
mentioned region would see a bunch of photons passing through his laboratory
with the arbitrarily large total energy. We speculate that this phenomenon may
have observable consequences.

existing stream classifiers based on accuracy can suffer poor minority class

sensitive to the non-Gaussian features in the primordial fluctuations, the same
fluctuations that evolved into today's planets, stars and galaxies. However,
this invaluable information is potentially screened, as not all of the observed
non-Gaussianity is of primordial origin. Indeed, a bispectrum arises even for
perfectly Gaussian initial conditions due to non-linear dynamics, such as CMB
photons scattering off free electrons and propagating in an inhomogeneous
Universe. In this thesis, I introduce the reader to this intrinsic bispectrum
in a pedagogic way, building up from the standard model of cosmology and from
cosmological perturbation theory, the tool cosmologists use to unravel the
history of the cosmos. In doing so, I introduce $\text{SONG}$, a new and
efficient code for solving the second-order Einstein and Boltzmann equations.
Next, I move on to answer the crucial question: is the intrinsic bispectrum
going to screen the primordial signal in the CMB? Using $\text{SONG}$ I compute
the intrinsic bispectrum and shows how its contamination leads to a small bias
in the estimates of primordial non-Gaussianity, a great news for the prospect
of using CMB data to probe primordial non-Gaussianity.

shales. These developments include a change from low-volume, high-viscosity
fluid injection to high-volume, low-viscosity injection. The injected fluid
introduces distributed damage that provides fracture permeability for the
extraction of the gas and oil. In order to model this process, we utilize a
loopless non-trapping invasion percolation previously introduced to model
optimal polymers in a strongly disordered medium, and for determining minimum
energy spanning trees on a lattice. We performed numerical simulations on a 2D
square lattice and find significant differences from other percolation models.
Additionally, we find that the growing fracture network satisfies both
Horton-Strahler and Tokunaga network statistics. As with other invasion
percolation models, our model displays burst dynamics, in which the cluster
extends rapidly into a connected region. We introduce an alternative definition
of bursts to be a consecutive series of opened bonds whose strengths are all
below a specified value. Using this definition of bursts, we find good
agreement with a power-law frequency-area distribution. These results are
generally consistent with the observed distribution of microseismicity observed
during a high-volume frack.

by surface tension, is a unique locomotion strategy well adapted for the
environmental niche on the surface of water. Although previously described in
phylogenetically basal aquatic insects like stone flies, the biomechanics of
interfacial flight has never been analyzed. Here, we report interfacial flight
as an adapted behaviour in water-lily beetles (Galerucella nymphaeae, Linnaeus
1758) which are also dexterous airborne fliers. We present the first
quantitative biomechanical model of interfacial flight in insects, uncovering
an intricate interplay of capillary, aerodynamic and neuromuscular forces. We
show that water-lily beetles use their tarsal claws to attach themselves to the
interface, via a fluid contact line pinned at the claw. We investigate the
kinematics of interfacial flight trajectories using high-speed imaging and
construct a mathematical model describing the flight dynamics. Our results show
that nonlinear surface tension forces make interfacial flight energetically
expensive compared to airborne flight at the relatively high speeds
characteristic of water-lily beetles, and cause chaotic dynamics to arise
naturally in these regimes. We identify the crucial roles of capillary-gravity
wave drag and oscillatory surface tension forces which dominate interfacial
flight, showing that the air-water interface presents a radically modified
force landscape for flapping wing flight compared to air.

depending on the ratio between the angular velocity $\omega$ and the trap size

compute a critical value $\omega_c>0$ such that the optimal trap location is at

governed by the scaling of topologically nontrivial two-dimensional classical

paper a statistical framework for a general two-colored urn model. The
probability to draw a ball at each step depends on the number of balls of each
color and on a multidimensional parameter $\theta$ through a function $f$,
called a choice function. We introduce two estimators of $\theta$: the maximum
likelihood estimator and a weighted least squares estimator which is less
efficient, but is closer to the calibration techniques used in the applied
literature. In general, the model is an inhomogeneous Markov chain and this
property makes the estimation of the parameter impossible on a single path,
even if it were infinite. Therefore we assume that we observe i.i.d.
experiments, each of a predetermined finite length. This is coherent with the
usual experimental set-ups. We apply the statistical framework to a real life
experiment: the selection of a path among pre-existing channels by an ant
colony. We performed experiments, which consisted of letting ants pass through
the branches of a fork. We consider the particular urn model proposed by J.-L.
Deneubourg in 1990 to describe this phenomenon. We simulate this model for
several parameter values in order to assess the accuracy of the MLE and the
WLSE. Then we estimate the parameter from the experimental data and evaluate
confident regions with Bootstrap algorithms. The findings of this paper do not
contradict the biological literature, but give statistical significance to the
values of the parameter found therein.

concurrency where agents interact by telling and asking constraints. Since
their inception, CCP-languages have been designed for having a strong
connection to logic. In fact, the underlying constraint system can be built
from a suitable fragment of intuitionistic (linear) logic --ILL-- and processes
can be interpreted as formulas in ILL. Constraints as ILL formulas fail to
represent accurately situations where ""preferences"" (called soft constraints)
such as probabilities, uncertainty or fuzziness are present. In order to
circumvent this problem, c-semirings have been proposed as algebraic structures
for defining constraint systems where agents are allowed to tell and ask soft
constraints. Nevertheless, in this case, the tight connection to logic and
proof theory is lost. In this work, we give a proof theoretical interpretation
to soft constraints: they can be defined as formulas in a suitable fragment of
ILL with subexponentials (SELL) where subexponentials, ordered in a c-semiring
structure, are interpreted as preferences. We hence achieve two goals: (1)
obtain a CCP language where agents can tell and ask soft constraints and (2)
prove that the language in (1) has a strong connection with logic. Hence we
keep a declarative reading of processes as formulas while providing a logical
framework for soft-CCP based systems. An interesting side effect of (1) is that
one is also able to handle probabilities (and other modalities) in SELL, by
restricting the use of the promotion rule for non-idempotent c-semirings.This
finer way of controlling subexponentials allows for considering more
interesting spaces and restrictions, and it opens the possibility of specifying
more challenging computational systems.

most massive high-redshift galaxies; thus, their properties provide important
constraints on galaxy evolution models. However, there is still a debate about
their stellar masses and their nature in the context of the general galaxy
population. To test the reliability of their stellar mass determinations, we
used a sample of simulated submm galaxies for which we derived stellar masses
via spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling (with Grasil, Magphys, Hyperz
and LePhare) adopting various star formation histories (SFHs). We found that
the assumption of SFHs with two independent components leads to the most
accurate stellar masses. Exponentially declining SFHs (tau) lead to lower
masses (albeit still consistent with the true values), while the assumption of
single-burst SFHs results in a significant mass underestimation. Thus, we
conclude that studies based on the higher masses inferred from fitting the SEDs
of real submm galaxies with double SFHs are most likely to be correct, implying
that submm galaxies lie on the high-mass end of the main sequence of
star-forming galaxies. This conclusion appears robust to assumptions of whether
or not submm galaxies are driven by major mergers, since the suite of simulated
galaxies modelled here contains examples of both merging and isolated galaxies.
We identified discrepancies between the true and inferred stellar ages (rather
than the dust attenuation) as the primary determinant of the success/failure of
the mass recovery. Regardless of the choice of SFH, the SED-derived stellar
masses exhibit a factor of ~2 scatter around the true value; this scatter is an
inherent limitation of the SED modelling due to simplified assumptions.
Finally, we found that the contribution of active galactic nuclei does not have
any significant impact on the derived stellar masses.

potential disorder. In the clean system, the density of states vanishes
quadratically at the Dirac point. Disorder is known to be perturbatively
irrelevant, and previous theoretical work has assumed that the Dirac semimetal
phase, characterized by a vanishing density of states, survives at weak
disorder, with a finite disorder phase transition to a diffusive metal with a
non-vanishing density of states. In this paper we show that nonperturbative
effects from rare regions, which are missed by conventional disorder-averaged
calculations, instead give rise to a nonzero density of states for any nonzero
disorder. Thus, there is no Dirac semimetal phase at non-zero disorder. The
results are established both by a heuristic scaling argument and via a
systematic saddle point analysis. We also discuss transport near the Dirac
point. At the Dirac point, we argue that transport is diffusive, and proceeds
via hopping between rare resonances. As one moves in chemical potential away
from the Dirac point, there are interesting intermediate-energy regimes where
the rare regions produce scattering resonances that determine the DC
conductivity. We derive a scaling theory of transport near disordered 3D Dirac
points. We also discuss the interplay of disorder with attractive interactions
at the Dirac point, and the resulting granular superconducting and Bose glass
phases. Our results are relevant for all 3D systems with Dirac points,

tool for disentangling the contributions of in-situ and ex-situ formed stars.
In the two-phase galaxy formation scenario, the initial gas collapse creates
steep metallicity gradients, while the accretion of stars formed in satellites
tends to flatten these gradients in the outskirts, particularly for massive
galaxies. This work presents the first compilation of extended metallicity
profiles over a wide range of galaxy mass. We use the DEIMOS spectrograph on
the Keck telescope in multi-slit mode to obtain radial stellar metallicity
profiles for 22 nearby early-type galaxies. From the calcium triplet lines in
the near-infrared we measure the metallicity of the starlight up to 3 effective
radii. We find a relation between the outer metallicity gradient and galaxy
mass, in the sense that lower mass systems show steeper metallicity gradients
than more massive galaxies. This result is consistent with a picture in which
the ratio of ex-situ to in-situ formed stars is lower in less massive galaxies
as a consequence of the smaller contribution by accretion. In addition, we
infer a correlation between the strength of the calcium triplet feature in the
near-infrared and the stellar initial mass function slope that is consistent

secular processes enhance the inward migration of the innermost planets in
these systems, and can drive them to short orbital periods. Resonant
interactions of both the mean motion and secular variety are observed, although
the interactions are not strong enough to drive systemic instability in most

and accretion rate, and parameters related to the dominance of a wind in the
broad emission line region. We match the FIRST source catalog to samples of
luminous quasars (both spectroscopic and photometric), primarily from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. After accounting for catastrophic errors in BH mass
estimates at high-redshift, we find that both the RLF and the mean radio
luminosity increase for increasing BH mass and decreasing accretion rate.
Similarly both the RLF and mean radio loudness increase for quasars which are
argued to have weaker radiation line driven wind components of the broad
emission line region. In agreement with past work, we find that the RLF
increases with increasing luminosity and decreasing redshift while the mean
radio-loudness evolves in the exact opposite manner. This difference in
behavior between the mean radio-loudness and the RLF in L-z may indicate
selection effects that bias our understanding of the evolution of the RLF;
deeper surveys in the optical and radio are needed to resolve this discrepancy.
Finally, we argue that radio-loud (RL) and radio-quiet (RQ) quasars may be
parallel sequences but where only RQ quasars at one extreme of the distribution

two-sided testing can reduce power compared to the doubled $p$-value, due to

our models are constrained by transitions over an unprecedented range in

However, it has proved challenging to develop large-area defectless graphene

multilayer graphitic films made by chemical reduction of easily and cheaply
produced graphene oxide laminates. They are found to provide a practically
perfect barrier that blocks all gases, liquids and aggressive chemicals

laminates are reduced in hydroiodic acid, no permeation of hydrogen and water
could be detected for films as thin as 30 nm, which remain optically
transparent. The films thicker than 100 nm become completely impermeable. The
exceptional barrier properties are attributed to a high degree of
graphitization of the laminates and little structural damage during reduction.
This work indicates a close prospect of thin protective coatings with stability

two-level atoms that are spatially organized by weak optical fields give rise
to a nonlinear material response that is greatly enhanced beyond that
attainable in a homogeneous gas. Specifically, in the regime where the
intensity of the applied optical fields is much less than the off-resonant
saturation intensity, we show that the third-order nonlinear susceptibility
scales inversely with atomic temperature and, due to this scaling, can be two
orders of magnitude larger than that of a homogeneous gas for typical
experimental parameters. As a result, we predict that spatially bunched
two-level atoms can exhibit single-photon nonlinearities. Our model is valid
for all atomic temperature regimes and simultaneously accounts for the
back-action of the atoms on the optical fields. Our results agree with previous
theoretical and experimental results for light-atom interactions that have
considered only a limited range of temperatures. For lattice beams tuned to the
low-frequency side of the atomic transition, we find that the nonlinearity
transitions from a self-focusing type to a self-defocusing type at a critical
intensity. We also show that higher than third-order nonlinear optical
susceptibilities are significant in the regime where the dipole potential
energy is on the order of the atomic thermal energy. We therefore find that it
is crucial to retain high-order nonlinearities to accurately predict
interactions of laser fields with spatially organized ultracold atoms. The

continuously in time. As with all cyberphysical systems, ensuring hard

analytical tool for guaranteeing such constraint satisfaction is the viability
kernel: the set of all initial conditions for which a safety-preserving control
law (that is, a control law that satisfies all input and state constraints)

approximates the viability kernel for high-dimensional sampled-data linear

Carpenter, where the momentum direction associated with an incoming trajectory
initiated at a high energy saddle point determines to a considerable extent the
outcome of the reaction (passage through the diametrically opposing exit
channel). By studying a `stretched' version of the caldera model, we have
uncovered a generalized dynamical matching: bundles of trajectories can reflect
off a hard potential wall so as to end up exiting predominantly through the
transition state opposite the reflection point. We also investigate the effects
of dissipation on the classical dynamics. In addition to classical trajectory
studies, we examine the dynamics of quantum wave packets on the caldera
potential (stretched and unstretched). These computations reveal a quantum
mechanical analogue of the `dynamical matching' phenomenon, where the initial
expectation value of the momentum direction for the wave packet determines the

of merging events which shock heat the intracluster gas. Temperature maps were
made from both \textit{Chandra} and \textit{XMM-Newton} obervations. The
combination of a new, long-exposure \textit{XMM} observation and an improved
temperature map binning technique produced the highest fidelity temperature
maps of A85 to date. Hot regions were detected near the subclusters to the
South and Southwest in both the \textit{Chandra} and \textit{XMM} temperature
maps. The presence of these structures implies A85 is not relaxed. The hot
regions may indicate the presence of shocks. The Mach numbers were estimated to
be $\sim$1.9 at the locations of the hot spots. Observational effects will tend
to systematically reduce temperature jumps, so the measured Mach numbers are
likely underestimated. Neither temperature map showed evidence for a shock in
the vicinity of the presumed radio relic near the Southwest subcluster.
However, the presence of a weak shock cannot be ruled out. There was tension
between the temperatures measured by the two instruments.

MoS2, a semiconductor in the TMD family, with its remarkable thermal and
chemical stability and high mobility, has emerged as a promising candidate for
post-silicon applications such as switching, photonics, and flexible
electronics. Since these rely on controlling the position of the Fermi energy
(EF), it is crucial to understand its dependence on doping and gating. Here we
employed scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) with gating
capabilities to measure the bandgap and the position of EF in MoS2, and to
track its evolution with gate voltage. For bulk samples, the measured bandgap
(~1.3eV) is comparable to the value obtained by photoluminescence, and the
position of EF (~0.35eV) below the conduction band, is consistent with n-doping
reported in this material. Using topography together with spectroscopy we
traced the source of the n-doping in bulk MoS2 samples to point defects, which
we attribute to S vacancies. In contrast, for thin films deposited on SiO2, we
found significantly higher levels of n-doping that cannot be attributed to S
vacancies. By combining gated STS with transport measurements in a field effect
transistor (FET) configuration, we demonstrate that the higher levels of
n-doping in thin film samples is due to charge traps at the sample-substrate

TeV scale physics. Although in the previous work, rather large Yukawa couplings
constants; i.e., greater than about 3, are required to reproduce the muon mass,
we do not need to introduce such a large but ${\cal O}$(1) couplings. In our
model, masses for neutrinos (charged-leptons) are generated by a dimension five
effective operator with two isospin triplet (singlet and doublet) scalar
fields. Thus, the mass hierarchy between neutrinos and charged-leptons can be
naturally described by the difference in the number of vacuum expectation
values (VEVs) of the triplet fields which must be much smaller than the VEV of
the doublet field due to the constraint from the electroweak rho parameter.
Furthermore, the discrepancy in the measured muon anomalous magnetic moment
($g-2$) from the prediction in the standard model are explained by one-loop
contributions from vector-like extra charged-leptons which are necessary to
obtain the radiative generation of the lepton masses. We study the decay
property of the extra leptons by taking into account the masses of muon,
neutrinos, muon $g-2$ and dark matter physics. We find that the extra leptons
can mainly decay into the mono-muon, dark matter with or without $Z$ bosons in

RuGa$_3$. We find that the inclusion of sizable amounts of Mn and Zn dopants
into FeGa$_3$ does not induce an insulator-to-metal transition. Our study
indicates that both substitution of Zn onto the Ga site and replacement of Fe
by Mn introduces states into the semiconducting gap that remain localized even
at highest doping levels. Most importantly, using neutron powder diffraction
measurements, we establish that FeGa$_3$ orders magnetically above room
temperature in a complex structure, which is almost unaffected by the doping
with Mn and Zn. Using realistic many-body calculations within the framework of
dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), we argue that while the iron atoms in
FeGa$_3$ are dominantly in an $S=1$ state, there are strong charge and spin
fluctuations on short time scales, which are independent of temperature.
Further, the low magnitude of local contributions to the spin susceptibility
advocates an itinerant mechanism for the spin response in FeGa$_3$. Our joint
experimental and theoretical investigations classify FeGa$_3$ as a correlated
band insulator with only small dynamical correlation effects, in which
non--local exchange interactions are responsible for the spin gap of 0.4 eV and
the antiferromagnetic order. We show that hole doping of FeGa$_3$ leads, within
DMFT, to a notable strengthening of many--body renormalizations.

Bai and Saranadasa (1996) and Srivastava and Du (2006). In this paper, we focus
on Hotelling's test and Dempster's test. The comparative merits and demerits of
these two tests vary according to the local parameters. In particular, we
consider the situation where it is difficult to determine which test should be
used, that is, where the two tests are asymptotically equivalent in terms of
local power. We propose a new statistic based on the weighted averaging of
Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic and Dempster's statistic that can be applied in
such a situation. Our weight is determined on the basis of the maximum local
asymptotic power on a restricted parameter space that induces local asymptotic
equivalence between Hotelling's test and Dempster's test. In addition, some
good asymptotic properties with respect to the local power are shown. Numerical
results show that our test is more stable than Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic and

two states, one shallow and one deep, attached to the ground-state of the

$\Delta(\xi)$, already known in the case of three bosons. In the three-particle
system the angle $\xi$, determined by the ratio of the two- and three-body
binding energies $E_3/E_2=\tan^2\xi$, characterizes the Discrete Scale
Invariance of the system. Extending the definition of the angle to the $N$-body

intermediate levels of uncertainty call for retaining memory of the past.

hierarchical. Secular dynamics controls its long term evolution with orbital
commensurability having negligible effect. Secular interactions transfer
angular momentum between inner and outer orbits unless their apsidal lines are
parallel or anti-parallel. These choices correspond, respectively, to
orthogonal eigenmodes p and a. Each is characterized by an eccentricity ratio
set by the masses and semi-major axes, i.e., $e_{p, 1}/e_{p, 2}\sim a_1/a_2$
while $e_{a, 1}/e_{a, 2}\sim (a_1/a_2)^{-3/2}(m_2/m_1)$. Mode p dominates the
system's current state so $e_1/e_2$ always remains close to $e_{p, 1}/e_{p,
2}$. A small contribution by Mode a causes $e_1$ and $e_2$ to oscillate with
period $\sim 10^3\,\yr$. Orbital changes should be apparent in a few years.
These will reveal the forcing of the apsidal precession of the inner orbit by
general relativity (GR), and possibly also the smaller contribution due to the
tidal and rotational distortion of the inner white dwarf (WD). Phinney (1992)
proposes that the epicyclic energy of a WD-pulsar binary reaches equipartition
with the kinetic energy of a single convective eddy when the WD's progenitor
fills its Roche lobe. We extend Phinney's theory to apply to modes rather than
individual orbits. Thus we predict that Mode p and Mode a achieved
equipartition with eddies in the giant envelopes of the progenitors of the
outer and inner WD, respectively. The most effective eddies are those with
lifetimes closest to the orbit period. These were more energetic in the
progenitor of the outer WD. This explains why Mode p overwhelms Mode a, and
also why the inner binary's orbit is far more eccentric than other WD-pulsar
binaries with similar orbit periods. Mode a's small but finite amplitude places
a lower bound of $Q\sim 10^6$ on the tidal quality parameter of the inner WD.

strategy based on co-integration relationships where we discover candidate
portfolios using multiple factors rather than just price data. The portfolio
selection methodologies include K-means clustering, graphical lasso and a
combination of the two. Our results show that clustering appears to yield
better candidate portfolios on average than naively using graphical lasso over
the entire equity pool. A hybrid approach of using the combination of graphical
lasso and clustering yields better results still. We also examine the effects
of an adaptive approach during the trading period, by re-computing potential
portfolios once to account for change in relationships with passage of time.
However, the adaptive approach does not produce better results than the one
without re-learning. Our results managed to pass the test for the presence of
statistical arbitrage test at a statistically significant level. Additionally
we were able to validate our findings over a separate dataset for formation and

The system operates according to the opportunistic beamforming framework in a

maximum number of co-scheduled users in a cell is equal to its transmission
rank, thus increasing it will have the effect of increasing the multiplexing

the network, which will decrease the rate of communication. This paper focuses
on optimally setting the transmission rank at each base station such that a set

rate per beam at each base station, is not violated. Expressions representing
the achievable region of transmission ranks are obtained considering different

indicates a likelihood of $\sim 70-80%$ that the $R_{\rm h}=ct$ Universe is the
correct cosmology versus $\sim 20-30%$ for the standard model. This possibly
interesting result reinforces the need to greatly expand the sample of
time-delay lenses, e.g., with the successful implementation of the Dark Energy
Survey, the VST ATLAS survey, and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. In
anticipation of a greatly expanded catalog of time-delay lenses identified with
these surveys, we have produced synthetic samples to estimate how large they
would have to be in order to rule out either model at a $\sim 99.7%$ confidence
level. We find that if the real cosmology is $\Lambda$CDM, a sample of $\sim
150$ time-delay lenses would be sufficient to rule out $R_{\rm h}=ct$ at this
level of accuracy, while $\sim 1,000$ time-delay lenses would be required to
rule out $\Lambda$CDM if the real Universe is instead $R_{\rm h}=ct$. This
difference in required sample size reflects the greater number of free

related to the importance of the critical quantum and thermal fluctuations near
such a point. However, direct and continuous control of these fluctuations has
been difficult to realize, and complete thermodynamic and spectroscopic
information is required to disentangle the effects of quantum and classical
physics around a QCP. Here we achieve this control in a high-pressure,

that quantum and thermal fluctuations can behave largely independently near a

admits regular orbits overall in the phase-space can be represented by a
function of three action variables. This type of distribution function in
Galactic models is often constructed theoretically for comparison of the
Galactic models with observational data as a test of the models. On the other
hand, observations give Cartesian phase-space coordinates of stars. Therefore
it is necessary to relate action variables and Cartesian coordinates in
investigating whether the distribution function constructed in galaxy models
can explain observational data. Generating functions are very useful in
practice for this purpose, because calculations of relations between action
variables and Cartesian coordinates by generating functions do not require a
lot of computational time or computer memory in comparison with direct
numerical integration calculations of stellar orbits. Here, we propose a new
method called a torus-fitting method, by which a generating function is derived
numerically for models of the Galactic potential in which almost all orbits are
regular. We confirmed the torus-fitting method can be applied to major orbit
families (box and loop orbits) in some two-dimensional potentials. Furthermore,
the torus-fitting method is still applicable to resonant orbit families,
besides major orbit families. Hence the torus-fitting method is useful for
analyzing real Galactic systems in which a lot of resonant orbit families might
exist.

measured with high accuracy. At the same time, the theoretical description of
light nuclei has made enormous progress, and properties of, e.g., the Helium
isotopes can now be calculated {\it ab initio}. These advances make those rare
isotopes an ideal testing ground for effective field theories (EFTs) built upon
cluster degrees of freedom.
  Purpose: Systems with widely separated intrinsic scales are well suited to an
EFT treatment. The Borromean halo nucleus $^6$He exhibits such a separation of
scales. In this work an EFT in which the degrees of freedom are the valence
neutrons ($n$) and an inert $^4$He-core ($\alpha$) is employed. The properties
of ${}^6$He can then be calculated using the momentum-space Faddeev equations
for the $\alpha nn$ bound state to obtain information on ${}^6$He at leading
order (LO) within the EFT.
  Results: The $nn$ virtual state and the $^2$P$_{3/2}$ resonance in $^5$He
give the two-body amplitudes which are input to our LO three-body Halo EFT
calculation. We find that without a genuine three-body interaction the
two-neutron separation energy $S_{2n}$ of ${}^6$He is strongly cutoff
dependent. We introduce a $nn \alpha$ ""three-body"" operator which renormalizes
the system, adjusting its coefficient to reproduce the $S_{2n}$ of $^6$He. The
Faddeev components are then cutoff independent for cutoffs of the order of, and
above, the breakdown scale of the Halo EFT.
  Conclusions: As in the case of a three-body system where only resonant s-wave
interactions are present, one three-body input is required for the
renormalization of the EFT equations that describe $^6$He at LO. However, in
contrast to the s-wave-only case, the running of the LO $nn\alpha$ counterterm
does not exhibit discrete scale invariance, due to the presence of the p-wave
$n\alpha$ interaction.

successive attempts of guessing a word of a certain length consisting of
letters with given probabilities of occurrence. Both first- and second-order
approximations to a natural language are considered. The guessing strategy used
is guessing words in decreasing order of probability. When word and alphabet
sizes are large, approximations are necessary in order to estimate the number
of guesses. Several kinds of approximations are discussed demonstrating
moderate requirements concerning both memory and CPU time. When considering
realistic sizes of alphabets and words (100) the number of guesses can be
estimated within minutes with reasonable accuracy (a few percent). For many
probability distributions the density of the logarithm of probability products
is close to a normal distribution. For those cases it is possible to derive an
analytical expression for the average number of guesses. The proportion of
guesses needed on average compared to the total number decreases almost
exponentially with the word length. The leading term in an asymptotic expansion
can be used to estimate the number of guesses for large word lengths.

heart transplantation is usually the only guarantee of survival beyond this
period. The number of donor hearts available currently is less than 3,000 per
annum worldwide. Apart from the relatively fortunate people who receive donor
hearts for transplant, the only alternative for people with HF is the
implantation of rotary blood pump (IRBP). In fact, an IRBP with its continuous
operation requires a more complex controller to achieve basic physiological
requirements. The essential control requirement of an IRBP needs to mimic the
way that the heart pumps as much blood to the arterial circulation as it
receives from the venous circulation. This research aims to design, develop and
implement novel control strategies combining sensorless and non-invasive data
measurements to provide an adaptive and fairly robust preload sensitive
controller for IRBPs subjected to varying patient conditions, model
uncertainties and external disturbances. A sensorless pulastile flow estimator
was developed using collected data from animal experiments. Based on this
estimator, advanced physiological control algorithms for regulation of an IRBP
were developed to automatically adjust the pump speed to cater for changes in
the metabolic demand.The performance of the developed control algorithms are
assessed using a lumped parameter model of the CVS that was previously
developed using actual data from healthy pigs over a wide range of operating
conditions. Immediate responses of the controllers to short-term circulatory
changes as well as adaptive characteristics of the controllers in response to
long-term changes are examined in a parameter-optimised model of CVS - IRBP
interactions. Simulation results prove that the proposed controllers are fairly
robust against model uncertainties, parameter variations and external
disturbances.

classification problems, any Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) learning rule
has close to optimal sample complexity. In this paper we seek for a generic
optimal learner for multiclass prediction. We start by proving a surprising
result: a generic optimal multiclass learner must be improper, namely, it must
have the ability to output hypotheses which do not belong to the hypothesis
class, even though it knows that all the labels are generated by some
hypothesis from the class. In particular, no ERM learner is optimal. This
brings back the fundmamental question of ""how to learn""? We give a complete
answer to this question by giving a new analysis of the one-inclusion
multiclass learner of Rubinstein et al (2006) showing that its sample
complexity is essentially optimal. Then, we turn to study the popular
hypothesis class of generalized linear classifiers. We derive optimal learners
that, unlike the one-inclusion algorithm, are computationally efficient.
Furthermore, we show that the sample complexity of these learners is better
than the sample complexity of the ERM rule, thus settling in negative an open
question due to Collins (2005).

investigated in a small number of materials \cite{Pantea 2006,Chapman

understanding the whole suite of properties together. By studying models with

pressure-enhanced NTE, and pressure-induced softening naturally emerge
together. We then show how anharmonic interactions lead to structural warm

interesting physical phenomena. Here, we report a detailed analysis of powder
neutron diffraction (ND) studies on polycrystalline Y1-xDyxMnO3 (x = 0, 0.05)
as a function of temperature. Our analysis shows that Dy doping at Y site leads
to modification in lattice constants: unit cell shrinks in c direction, but
expands in ab plane, unit cell volume increases and effective Mn magnetic
moment also reduces. All the Mn-O bond lengths and O-Mn-O bond angles shows
significant variations leading to reduction in tilting of MnO5 polyhedra.
Dielectric measurements on these samples show that, due to Dy doping, inverse
S-shape anomaly shifts to the lower temperature side and magnetoelectric
coupling decreases. Magnetic measurements confirm the decrease in the
frustration of Mn triangular lattice. Temperature dependent specific heat
measurement shows anomaly at N\'eel temperature (TN) and results indicate a
decrease in entropy due to Dy doping. These results are understood in terms of
modification in magnetoelectric coupling triggered due to Dy induced strain in
Y plane of YMnO3.

species are affected by changes in both mean abundance and variability
(coefficient of variation) of their predator's primary prey. The theory is
motivated by the indirect effects of cyclic rodent populations on
ground-breeding birds, and developed through progressive analytic
simplifications of an empirically-based model. It applies nonetheless to many
other systems where primary prey have fast life-histories and can become
locally superabundant, which facilitates impact on alternative prey species. In
contrast to classic apparent competition theory based on symmetric
interactions, our results suggest that predator effects on alternative prey
should generally decrease with mean primary prey abundance, and increase with
primary prey variability (low to high CV) - unless predators have strong
aggregative responses, in which case these results can be reversed.
Approximations of models including predator dynamics (general numerical
response with possible delays) confirm these results but further suggest that
negative temporal correlation between predator and primary prey is harmful to
alternative prey. We find in general that predator numerical responses are
crucial to predict the response of ecosystems to changes in key prey species
exhibiting outbreaks, and extend the apparent competition/mutualism theory to
asymmetric interactions.

operating in the plane in Look-Compute-Move cycles: each agent has an
externally visible light which can assume colors from a fixed set; the lights
are persistent (i.e., the color is not erased at the end of a cycle), but
otherwise the agents are oblivious. The investigation of computability in this
model, initially suggested by Peleg, is under way, and several results have
been recently established. In these investigations, however, an agent is
assumed to be capable to see through another agent. In this paper we start the
study of computing when visibility is obstructable, and investigate the most
basic problem for this setting, Complete Visibility: The agents must reach
within finite time a configuration where they can all see each other and
terminate. We do not make any assumption on a-priori knowledge of the number of
agents, on rigidity of movements nor on chirality. The local coordinate system
of an agent may change at each activation. Also, by definition of lights, an
agent can communicate and remember only a constant number of bits in each
cycle. In spite of these weak conditions, we prove that Complete Visibility is
always solvable, even in the asynchronous setting, without collisions and using
a small constant number of colors. The proof is constructive. We also show how
to extend our protocol for Complete Visibility so that, with the same number of
colors, the agents solve the (non-uniform) Circle Formation problem with
obstructed visibility.

is not in accord with the real distribution of feature functions. This paper
introduces coordinate system selection (RSS) into the search algorithm for
MERT. Contrary to previous approaches in which every dimension only corresponds
to one independent feature function, we create several coordinate systems by
moving one of the dimensions to a new direction. The basic idea is quite simple

finite automaton (DFA) is called the synchronizing word if w sends all states

n-state complete DFA possessing a minimal synchronizing word of length (n-1)^2.
The hypothesis, well known today as the Cerny conjecture, claims that it is
also precise upper bound on the length of such a word for a complete DFA. This
simple looking conjecture is arguably the most fascinating and longstanding
open problem in the theory of finite automaton. The hypothesis was formulated
in 1966 by Starke. The problem has motivated great and constantly growing

algebra with non-standard operations on a special class of matrices (row
monomial), induced by words in the alphabet of labels on edges. These matrices
generate a space with respect to the mentioned operation. The proof is based on
connection between length of words u and dimension of the space generated by

on the relation between ranks of Mu and Lx.

one-dimensional and can be represented as \begin{equation}\label{eqn:1}
\Omega=\{ (x_1,x_2,x_3)\in \mathbb E \,:\, (x_1,x_2) \in

commuting square matrices of the same order satisfying
$[A_1^*,A_1]=[A_2^*,A_2]$ and a norm condition. The converse also holds, i.e, a
set of the form (\ref{eqn:1}) is always a distinguished variety in $\mathbb E$.
We show that for a triple of commuting operators $\Upsilon = (T_1,T_2,T_3)$
having $\overline{\mathbb E}$ as a spectral set, there is a one-dimensional

Tabling is a
commonly used technique in logic programming for avoiding cyclic behavior of
logic programs and enabling more declarative program definitions. Furthermore,
tabling often improves computational performance. Rational term are terms with
one or more infinite sub-terms but with a finite representation. Rational terms
can be generated in Prolog by omitting the occurs check when unifying two
terms. Applications of rational terms include definite clause grammars,
constraint handling systems, and coinduction. In this paper, we report our
extension of YAP's Prolog tabling mechanism to support rational terms. We
describe the internal representation of rational terms within the table space
and prove its correctness. We then use this extension to implement a tabling
based approach to coinduction. We compare our approach with current coinductive
transformations and describe the implementation. In addition, we present an
algorithm that ensures a canonical representation for rational terms.

the design of the table space. One of the most successful proposals for
representing tables is based on a two-level trie data structure, where one trie
level stores the tabled subgoal calls and the other stores the computed
answers. In this work, we present a simple and efficient lock-free design where
both levels of the tries can be shared among threads in a concurrent
environment. To implement lock-freedom we took advantage of the CAS atomic
instruction that nowadays can be widely found on many common architectures. CAS
reduces the granularity of the synchronization when threads access concurrent
areas, but still suffers from low-level problems such as false sharing or cache
memory side-effects. In order to be as effective as possible in the concurrent
search and insert operations over the table space data structures, we based our
design on a hash trie data structure in such a way that it minimizes potential
low-level synchronization problems by dispersing as much as possible the
concurrent areas. Experimental results in the Yap Prolog system show that our
new lock-free hash trie design can effectively reduce the execution time and
scale better than previous designs.

provide a model (in the Platonic Heaven of mathematics) for the
self-predicative strand of Plato's Theory of Forms as well as for the idea of a
""concrete universal"" in Hegel and similar ideas of paradigmatic exemplars in
ordinary thought. 2. The paper also shows how the always-self-predicative
universals of category theory provide the ""opposite bookend"" to the
never-self-predicative universals of iterative set theory and thus that the
paradoxes arose from having one theory (e.g., Frege's Paradise) where
universals could be either self-predicative or non-self-predicative (instead of
being always one or the other). 3. Moreover the paper considers one of the most
important examples of self-predicative universals in pure mathematics, namely
adjoint functors or adjunctions. It gives a parsing of adjunctions into two
halves (left and right semi-adjunctions) using the heterodox notion of
heteromorphisms, and then shows that the parts can be recombined in a new way
to define the cognate-to-adjoints notion of a brain functor that provides an
abstract conceptual model of a brain. 4. Finally the paper argues that at least
one way category theory has foundational relevance is that it isolates the
universal concepts and structures that are important throughout mathematics.

broadband and highly polarized pulsed radio emission. In order to determine the
nature of the emission and the physical characteristics in the source region,
we have made multi-epoch, wideband spectral observations of TVLM 0513-46 and 2M
0746+20. We combine these observations with archival radio data to fully
characterize both the temporal and spectral properties of the radio emission.
The continuum spectral energy distribution can be well modeled using
gyrosynchrotron emission from mildly relativistic electrons in a dipolar field.
The pulsed emission exhibits a variety of time-variable characteristics,
including frequency drifts, frequency cutoffs, and multiple pulses per period.
For 2M 0746+20 we determine a pulse period consistent with previously
determined values. We modeled locations of pulsed emission using an oblique
rotating magnetospheric model with beamed electron cyclotron maser (ECM)
sources. The best-fit models have narrow ECM beaming angles aligned with the
local source magnetic field direction, except for one isolated burst from 2M
0746+20. For TVLM 0513-46, the best-fit rotation axis inclination is nearly
orthogonal to the line of sight. For 2M 0746+20 we found a good fit using a
fixed inclination i=36 deg, determined from optical observations. For both
stars the ECM sources are located near feet of magnetic loops with radial
extents 1.2Rs-2.7 Rs and surface fields 2.2 - 2.5 kG. These results support
recent suggestions that radio over-luminous UCDs have a global `weak field'
non-axisymmetric magnetic topologies.

Sun with unprecedented resolution. Observations with the 1.6m New Solar
Telescope of the Big Bear Solar Observatory are making next steps in our
understanding of the solar surface structure. Granular-scale magnetic flux
emergence and the response of the solar atmosphere are among the key research.
As part of a joint observing program with NASA's IRIS mission, the NST observed
active region NOAA 11810 in photospheric and chromospheric wavelengths.
Complimentary data are provided by SDO and Hinode space-based telescopes. The
region displayed a group of solar pores, in the vicinity of which we detect a
small-scale buoyant horizontal magnetic flux tube causing abnormal granulation
and interacting with the pre-existing ambient field in upper atmospheric
layers. Following the expansion of distorted granules at the emergence site, we
observed a sudden appearance of an extended surge in the HeI data. IRIS catched
ejection of a hot plasma jet associated with the HeI-surge. The SDO/HMI data
reveal emerging magnetic looplike structures. Hinode/Ca II H and IRIS
filtergrams detail the connectivities of the newly emerged magnetic field in
the lower solar chromosphere. From these data we fid that the orientation of
the emerging flux tube was almost perpendicular to the overlying ambient field.
Nevertheless the interaction of emerging magnetic field lines with the
pre-existing overlying field generates high-temperature emission regions and
boosts the surge/jet production. The localized heating is detected before and
after the first signs of the surge/jet ejection. We compare the results with
previous observations and theoretical models, and propose a scenario for the
activation of plasma jet/surges and confined heating. Such process may play a
significant role in the mass and energy flow from the interior to the corona.
