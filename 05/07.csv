the chiral 3N interaction on several spectroscopic observables. The agreement
of some observables with experiment is improved significantly by the inclusion
of 3N interactions, e.g., the B(M1) from the first $J^\pi T = 1^+ 1$ state to

rational maps in two complex variables. In 2003 Lilov proved the non-existence
of wandering Fatou components for polynomial skew-products in the neighborhood
of an invariant super-attracting fiber. In fact Lilov proved a stronger result,
namely that the forward orbit of any vertical disk must intersect a fattened
Fatou component of the invariant fiber.
  Naturally the next class of maps to study are polynomial skew-products with
an invariant attracting (but not super-attracting) fiber. Here we show that
Lilov's stronger result does not hold in this setting: for some skew-products
there are vertical disks whose orbits accumulate at repelling fixed points in
the invariant fiber, and that therefore never intersect the fattened Fatou
components. These disks are necessarily Fatou disks, but we also prove that the
vertical disks we construct lie entirely in the Julia set.
  Our results therefore do not answer the existence question of wandering Fatou
components in the attracting setting, but show that the question is
considerably more complicated than in the super-attracting setting.

Wikipedia lines and Shakespeare plots, the resulting latent semantics capture
not only the associative links which form concepts, but also spatial dimensions
embedded within the surface structure of language. As both the shape and
movements of objects have been found to be associated with phonetic contrasts
already in toddlers, this study explores whether articulatory and acoustic
parameters may likewise differentiate the latent semantics of action verbs.
Selecting 3 x 20 emotion, face, and hand related verbs known to activate
premotor areas in the brain, their mutual cosine similarities were computed
using latent semantic analysis LSA, and the resulting adjacency matrices were
compared based on two different large scale text corpora; HAWIK and TASA.
Applying hierarchical clustering to identify common structures across the two
text corpora, the verbs largely divide into combined mouth and hand movements
versus emotional expressions. Transforming the verbs into their constituent
phonemes, the clustered small and large size movements appear differentiated by
front versus back vowels corresponding to increasing levels of arousal. Whereas
the clustered emotional verbs seem characterized by sequences of close versus
open jaw produced phonemes, generating up- or downwards shifts in formant
frequencies that may influence their perceived valence. Suggesting, that the
latent semantics of action verbs reflect parameters of intensity and emotional
polarity that appear correlated with the articulatory contrasts and acoustic
characteristics of phonemes

significant directions in the field of theoretical cosmology recently. First,
we are now able to make use of present observations, such as the Planck and
BICEP2 data, to examine theoretical predictions from the standard inflationary
$\Lambda$CDM which were made decades of years ago. Second, we can search for
new cosmological signatures as a way to explore physics beyond the standard
cosmic paradigm. In particular, a subset of early universe models admit a
nonsingular bouncing solution that attempts to address the issue of the big
bang singularity. These models have achieved a series of considerable
developments in recent years, in particular in their perturbative frameworks,
which made brand-new predictions of cosmological signatures that could be
visible in current and forthcoming observations. In this article we present two
representative paradigms of very early universe physics. The first is the
so-called new matter (or matter-ekpyrotic) bounce scenario in which the
universe starts with a matter-dominated contraction phase and transitions into
an ekpyrotic phase. In the setting of this paradigm, we propose some possible
mechanisms of generating a red tilt for primordial curvature perturbations and
confront its general predictions with recent cosmological observations. The
second is the matter-bounce inflation scenario which can be viewed as an
extension of inflationary cosmology with a matter contraction before inflation.
We present a class of possible model constructions and review its implications
on the current CMB experiments. Last, we review the significant achievements of
these paradigms beyond the inflationary $\Lambda$CDM model, which we expect to
shed new light on the direction of observational cosmology in the next decade
years.

the peculiar phenomenon of auto-acoustic compaction -- non-monotonic variation
of shear band volume with shear rate in angular particles -- recently observed
in experiments. Our approach is based on the notion that the volume of a
granular material is determined by an effective-disorder temperature known as
the compactivity. Noise sources in a driven granular material couple its
various degrees of freedom and the environment, causing the flow of entropy
between them. The grain-scale dynamics is described by the
shear-transformation-zone (STZ) theory of granular flow, which accounts for
irreversible plastic deformation in terms of localized flow defects whose
density is governed by the state of configurational disorder. To model the
effects of grain shape and frictional characteristics, we propose an Ising-like
internal variable to account for nearest-neighbor grain interlocking and
geometric frustration, and interpret the effect of friction as an acoustic
noise strength. We show quantitative agreement between experimental
measurements and theoretical predictions, and propose additional experiments
that provide stringent tests on the new theoretical elements.

developed in the literature, we permanently keep track of the light emitted by
each particle during the time the measurements of their positions ('altitudes')
and speeds are performed. By performing the Langevin simulation, we quantified
effect of biases such as Brownian motion, heterogeneities induced by the walls,
statistical biases, photo bleaching, polydispersivity and limited depth of
field. Using this method, we obtained slip length on hydrophilic surfaces of 1$
\pm $5 nm for sucrose solution, and 9$ \pm $10 nm for water; On hydrophobic
surface, 32$ \pm $5 nm for sucrose solution, and 55$ \pm $9 nm for water. The
errors (based on 95% confidence intervals) are significantly smaller than the
state-of-the-art, but more importantly, the method demonstrates for the first
time a capacity to measure slippage with a satisfactory accuracy, while
providing a local information on the flow structure with a nanometric
resolution. Our study confirms the discrepancy already pointed out in the
literature between numerical and experimental slip length estimates. With the
progress conveyed by the present work, TIRF based technique with continuous
tracking can be considered as a quantitative method for investigating flow
properties close to walls, providing both global and local information on the

architectures, greedy layer-wise pre-training is employed. In a well-trained
model, the lower layer of the architecture models the data distribution
conditional upon the hidden variables, while the higher layers model the hidden
distribution prior. But due to the greedy scheme of the layerwise training
technique, the parameters of lower layers are fixed when training higher
layers. This makes it extremely challenging for the model to learn the hidden
distribution prior, which in turn leads to a suboptimal model for the data
distribution. We therefore investigate joint training of deep autoencoders,
where the architecture is viewed as one stack of two or more single-layer
autoencoders. A single global reconstruction objective is jointly optimized,
such that the objective for the single autoencoders at each layer acts as a
local, layer-level regularizer. We empirically evaluate the performance of this
joint training scheme and observe that it not only learns a better data model,
but also learns better higher layer representations, which highlights its
potential for unsupervised feature learning. In addition, we find that the
usage of regularizations in the joint training scheme is crucial in achieving
good performance. In the supervised setting, joint training also shows superior
performance when training deeper models. The joint training framework can thus
provide a platform for investigating more efficient usage of different types of
regularizers, especially in light of the growing volumes of available unlabeled

(LN) core-shell nanocuboids and found that giant SHG can occur via deliberately
designed double plasmonic resonances. By controlling the aspect ratio, we can
tune fundamental wave (FW) and SHG signal to match the longitudinal and
transverse plasmonic modes simultaneously, and achieve giant enhancement of SHG
by more than five orders of magnitude in comparison to a bare LN nanocuboid and
by about one order of magnitude to the case adopting only single plasmonic
resonance. The underlying key physics is that the double-resonance nanoparticle
enables greatly enhanced trapping and harvesting of incident FW energy,
efficient internal transfer of optical energy from FW to SHW, and much improved
power to transport the SHG energy from the nanoparticle to the far-field
region. The proposed double-resonance nanostructure can serve as an efficient
subwavelength coherent light source through SHG and enable flexible engineering
of light-matter interaction at nanoscale.

We produce new upper and lower bounds for this problem in an abstract MAC layer
model that captures the key guarantees provided by most wireless MAC layers. In
more detail, we first generalize the well-known impossibility of deterministic
consensus with a single crash failure [FLP 1895] from the asynchronous message
passing model to our wireless setting. Proceeding under the assumption of no
faults, we then investigate the amount of network knowledge required to solve
consensus in our model---an important question given that these networks are
often deployed in an ad hoc manner. We prove consensus is impossible without
unique ids or without knowledge of network size (in multihop topologies). We
also prove a lower bound on optimal time complexity. We then match these lower
bounds with a pair of new deterministic consensus algorithms---one for single
hop topologies and one for multihop topologies---providing a comprehensive
characterization of the consensus problem in the wireless setting. From a
theoretical perspective, our results shed new insight into the role of network
information and the power of MAC layer abstractions in solving distributed
consensus. From a practical perspective, given the level of abstraction used by
our model, our upper bounds can be easily implemented in real wireless devices
on existing MAC layers while preserving their correctness
guarantees---facilitating the development of wireless distributed systems.

for testing relationshi ps between collections of related genes and an outcome
of interest in high throughput expression analyses. Using $M$ random
permutations, one can attain $p$-values as small as $1/(M+1)$. When many gene
sets are tested, we need smaller $p$-values, hence larger $M$, to achieve
significance while accounting for the n umber of simultaneous tests being made.
As a result, the number of permutations to be done rises along with the cost
per permutation. To reduce this cost, we seek parametric approximations to the
permutation distributions for gene set tes ts.
  {\bf Results:} We focus on two gene set methods related to sums and sums of
squared $t$ statistics. Our approach calculates exact relevant moments of a
weighted sum of (squared) test statistics under permutation. We find
moment-based gene set enrichment $p$-values that closely approximate the
permutation method $p$-values. The computational cost of our algorithm for
linear statistics is on the order of doing $|G|$ permutations, where $|G|$ is
the number of genes in set $G$. For the quadratic statistics, the cost is on
the order of $|G|^2$ permutations which is orders of magnitude faster than
naive permutation. We applied the permutation approximation method to three
public Parkinson's Disease expression datasets and discovered enriched gene
sets not previously discussed. In the analysis of these experiments with our
method, we are able to remove the granularity effects of permutation analyses
and have a substantial computational speedup with little cost to accura cy.

colorectal cancer. There is however some agreement on the fact that the
carcinogenic process is a result of several genetic mutations of normal cells.
The colon epithelium is characterized by millions of invaginations, very small
cavities, called crypts, where most of the cellular activity occurs. It is
consensual in the medical community, that a potential first manifestation of
the carcinogenic process, observed in conventional colonoscopy images, is the
appearance of Aberrant Crypt Foci (ACF). These are clusters of abnormal crypts,
morphologically characterized by an atypical behavior of the cells that
populate the crypts. In this work an homogenization model is proposed, for
representing the cellular dynamics in the colon epithelium. The goal is to
simulate and predict, in silico, the spread and evolution of ACF, as it can be
observed in colonoscopy images. By assuming that the colon is an heterogeneous
media, exhibiting a periodic distribution of crypts, we start this work by
describing a periodic model, that represents the ACF cell-dynamics in a
two-dimensional setting. Then, homogenization techniques are applied to this
periodic model, to find a simpler model, whose solution symbolizes the averaged
behavior of ACF at the tissue level. Some theoretical results concerning the
existence of solution of the homogenized model are proven, applying a fixed
point theorem. Numerical results showing the convergence of the periodic model
to the homogenized model are presented.

the Planck upper limit, $r < 0.11$ at 95% CL, has attracted a great deal of
attention. In this short note, we show that this discrepancy is mainly due to
an `apples to oranges' comparison. The result reported by BICEP2 was measured
at a pivot scale $k_* = 0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$, assuming $n_t = 0$, whereas the
Planck limit was provided at $k_* = 0.002$ Mpc$^{-1}$, assuming the slow-roll

constraint at $k_* = 0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$ becomes $r < 0.135$ at $95%$ CL, which
can be compared directly with the BICEP2 result. Once a plausible dust
contribution to the BICEP2 signal is taken into account (DDM2 model), $r$ is
reduced to $r = 0.16^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ and the discrepancy becomes of order

usage of Twitter during crises has attracted researchers to focus on detecting

paced events such as a crisis presents new opportunities and challenges. In
this paper, we investigate event detection in the context of real-time Twitter
streams as observed in real-world crises. We highlight the key challenges in
this problem: the informal nature of text, and the high volume and high
velocity characteristics of Twitter streams. We present a novel approach to
address these challenges using single-pass clustering and the compression
distance to efficiently detect events in Twitter streams. Through experiments
on large Twitter datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed framework is able
to detect events in near real-time and can scale to large and noisy Twitter
streams.

  Word Sense Disambiguation",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a problem in the field of computational
linguistics given as finding the intended sense of a word (or a set of words)
when it is activated within a certain context. WSD was recently addressed as a
combinatorial optimization problem in which the goal is to find a sequence of
senses that maximize the semantic relatedness among the target words. In this
article, a novel algorithm for solving the WSD problem called D-Bees is
proposed which is inspired by bee colony optimization (BCO)where artificial bee
agents collaborate to solve the problem. The D-Bees algorithm is evaluated on a
standard dataset (SemEval 2007 coarse-grained English all-words task corpus)and
is compared to simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and two ant colony
optimization techniques (ACO). It will be observed that the BCO and ACO
approaches are on par.

dominated by the irradiation from the nearby Herbig Be star R CrA. The luminous
large-scale emission makes it necessary to use high-resolution spectral imaging
to study the chemistry and dynamics of the inner envelopes and discs of the
protostars.
  Aims: We aim to better understand the structure of the inner regions of these
protostars and, in particular, the interplay between the chemistry and the
presence of discs.
  Methods: Using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
high-resolution spectral imaging interferometry observations, we study the
molecular line and dust continuum emission at submillimetre wavelengths.
  Results: We detect dust continuum emission from four circumstellar discs
around Class 0/I objects within the R CrA cloud. Towards IRS7B we detect
C$^{17}$O emission showing a rotation curve consistent with a Keplerian disc
with a well-defined edge that gives a good estimate for the disc radius at 50
AU. We derive the central object mass to $2.3M_{\odot}$ and the disc mass to
$0.024M_{\odot}$. The observations are also consistent with a model of material
infalling under conservation of angular momentum; however, this model provides
a worse fit to the data. We also report a likely detection of faint CH$_3$OH
emission towards this point source, as well as more luminous CH$_3$OH emission
in an outflow orthogonal to the major axis of the C$^{17}$O emission.
  Conclusions: The faint CH$_3$OH emission seen towards IRS7B can be explained
by a flat density profile of the inner envelope caused by the disc with a
radius $\lesssim50$ AU. We propose that the regions of the envelopes where
complex organic molecules are present in Class 0/I young stellar objects can
become quenched as the disc grows.

transformation processes suggests that S0 and spheroidal galaxies are
star-formation-quenched, ""red and dead"" versions of spiral and Im galaxies. In
particular, Sph galaxies are bulgeless S0s. This motivates a parallel sequence
galaxy classification in which an S0a-S0b-S0c-Sph sequence of decreasing

spectroscopic observations of BAT99 3a with the du Pont 2.5-m telescope and the
Southern African Large Telescope revealed that it is a close, eccentric binary
system, and that the absorption lines are associated with an O companion star.
We analyzed the spectrum of the binary system using the non-LTE Potsdam
Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) code, confirming that the WR component is a very hot (approx
90 kK) WN star. For this star, we derived a luminosity of log L/Lsun =5.45 and
a mass-loss rate of 10^{-5.8} Msun/yr, and found that the stellar wind
composition is dominated by helium with 20 per cent of hydrogen. Spectroscopy
of the shell revealed an He iii region centred on BAT99 3a and having the same
angular radius (approx 15 arcsec) as the shell. We thereby add a new example to
a rare class of high-excitation nebulae photoionized by WR stars. Analysis of
the nebular spectrum showed that the shell is composed of unprocessed material,
implying that the shell was swept-up from the local interstellar medium. We
discuss the physical relationship between the newly identified massive stars
and their possible membership of a previously unrecognized star cluster.

of star formation. The balance between the UV light from young, massive stars

relation between the attenuation (IRX for IR excess hereafter) and the stellar
mass, assuming a scatter of 0.4\,dex around this relation. We obtain a good
overall agreement with the measurements of the IR luminosity function up to z~3

reproduce the observed, flat relation between the mean IRX and the UV

(MBHs) with masses less than $\sim10^5 M_\odot$. These tidal interactions feed
material to the MBH well above its Eddington limit, with the potential to
launch a relativistic jet. The corresponding beamed emission is a promising
signpost to an otherwise quiescent MBH of relatively low mass. We show that the
mass transfer history, and thus the lightcurve, are quite different when the
disruptive orbit is parabolic, eccentric, or circular. The mass lost each orbit
exponentiates in the eccentric-orbit case leading to the destruction of the WD
after several tens of orbits. We examine the stellar dynamics of clusters
surrounding MBHs to show that single-passage WD disruptions are substantially
more common than repeating encounters. The $10^{49}$ erg s$^{-1}$ peak
luminosity of these events makes them visible to cosmological distances. They
may be detectible at rates of as many as tens per year by instruments like
Swift. In fact, WD-disruption transients significantly outshine their
main-sequence star counterparts, and are the most likely tidal interaction to
be detected arising from MBHs with masses less than $10^5 M_\odot$. The
detection or non-detection of such WD-disruption transients by Swift is,
therefore, a powerful tool to constrain lower end of the MBH mass function. The
emerging class of ultra-long gamma ray bursts all have peak luminosities and
durations reminiscent of WD disruptions, offering a hint that WD-disruption

that launch fast stellar winds. The integrated kinetic energy carried by these
winds is comparable to that delivered by supernova explosions, suggesting that
at early times winds could be an important form of feedback on the surrounding
cold material from which the star cluster formed. However, the interaction of
these winds with the surrounding clumpy, turbulent, cold gas is complex and
poorly understood. Here we investigate this problem via an accounting exercise:
we use empirically determined properties of four well-studied massive star
clusters to determine where the energy injected by stellar winds ultimately
ends up. We consider a range of kinetic energy loss channels, including
radiative cooling, mechanical work on the cold interstellar medium, thermal
conduction, heating of dust via collisions by the hot gas, and bulk advection
of thermal energy by the hot gas. We show that, for at least some of the
clusters, none of these channels can account for more than a small fraction of
the injected energy. We suggest that turbulent mixing at the hot-cold interface
or physical leakage of the hot gas from the HII region can efficiently remove
the kinetic energy injected by the massive stars in young star clusters. Even
for the clusters where we are able to account for all the injected kinetic
energy, we show that our accounting sets strong constraints on the importance
of stellar winds as a mechanism for feedback on the cold interstellar medium.

personalization, ranking, and content filtering. However, when users evaluate
content contributed by fellow users (e.g., by liking a post or voting on a
comment), these evaluations create complex social feedback effects. This paper
investigates how ratings on a piece of content affect its author's future
behavior. By studying four large comment-based news communities, we find that
negative feedback leads to significant behavioral changes that are detrimental
to the community. Not only do authors of negatively-evaluated content
contribute more, but also their future posts are of lower quality, and are
perceived by the community as such. Moreover, these authors are more likely to
subsequently evaluate their fellow users negatively, percolating these effects
through the community. In contrast, positive feedback does not carry similar
effects, and neither encourages rewarded authors to write more, nor improves
the quality of their posts. Interestingly, the authors that receive no feedback
are most likely to leave a community. Furthermore, a structural analysis of the
voter network reveals that evaluations polarize the community the most when
positive and negative votes are equally split.

parameters effective radius, stellar velocity dispersion, and the dynamical to
stellar mass ratio with redshift. As the effective radii of BOSS galaxies at
these redshifts are not well resolved in the SDSS imaging we calibrate the SDSS
size measurements with HST/COSMOS photometry for a sub-sample of galaxies. We
further apply a correction for progenitor bias to build a sample which consists
of a coeval, passively evolving population. Systematic errors due to size
correction and the calculation of dynamical mass, are assessed through Monte
Carlo simulations. At fixed stellar or dynamical mass, we find moderate
evolution in galaxy size and stellar velocity dispersion, in agreement with
previous studies. We show that this results in a decrease of the dynamical to
stellar mass ratio with redshift at >2sigma significance. By combining our
sample with high-redshift literature data we find that this evolution of the
dynamical to stellar mass ratio continues beyond z~0.7 up to z>2 as Mdyn/Mstar~
(1+z)^{-0.30+/- 0.12} further strengthening the evidence for an increase of
Mdyn/Mstar with cosmic time. This result is in line with recent predictions

redshift-dependent, so there is a visible relative shift between galaxies at

distinguish between strong and weak statements. However, even this problem is
understudied, partly due to a lack of data. Since strength is inherently
relative, revisions of texts that make claims are a natural source of data on
strength differences. In this paper, we introduce a corpus of sentence-level

The recent discovery of evidence for the ejection of r-process elements from a
short-duration gamma-ray burst singled out neutron star mergers (NSMs) as their
origin. In contrast, core-collapse supernovae are ruled out as the main origin
of heavy r-process elements (A>110) by recent numerical simulations. However,
the properties characterizing NSM events - their rarity and high yield of
r-process elements per event - have been claimed to be incompatible with the
observed stellar records on r-process elements in the Galaxy. We add to this
picture with our results, which show that the observed constant [r-process/H]
ratio in faint dwarf galaxies and one star unusually rich in r-process in the
Sculptor galaxy agree well with this rarity of NSM events. Furthermore, we
found that a large scatter in the abundance ratios of r-process elements to
iron in the Galactic halo can be reproduced by a scheme that incorporates an
assembly of various protogalactic fragments, in each of which r-process
elements supplied by NSMs pervade the whole fragment while supernovae
distribute heavy elements only inside the regions swept up by the blast waves.
Our results demonstrate that NSMs occurring at Galactic rate of 12-23 per Myr
are the main site of r-process elements, and we predict the detection of
gravitational waves from NSMs at a high rate with upcoming advanced detectors.

tracers such as galaxy or dark matter halo is essential to extract cosmological
information from ongoing or future galaxy redshift surveys. At sufficiently
large scales such as the BAO scale, a standard approach for the bias problem on
the basis of the perturbation theory (PT) is to assume the `local bias' model
in which the density field of biased tracers is deterministically expanded in
terms of matter density field at the same position. The higher-order bias
parameters are then determined by combining the power spectrum with
higher-order statistics such as the bispectrum. As is pointed out by recent
studies, however, nonlinear gravitational evolution naturally induces nonlocal
bias terms even if initially starting only with purely local bias. As a matter
of fact, previous works showed that the second-order nonlocal bias term, which
corresponds to the gravitational tidal field, is important to explain the
characteristic scale-dependence of the bispectrum. In this paper we extend the
nonlocal bias term up to third order, and investigate whether the PT-based
model including nonlocal bias terms can simultaneously explain the power
spectrum and the bispectrum of simulated halos in $N$-body simulations. We show
that the power spectrum, including density and momentum, and the bispectrum
between halo and matter in $N$-body simulations can be simultaneously well
explained by the model including up to third-order nonlocal bias terms up to
k~0.1h/Mpc. Also, the results seem in a good agreement with theoretical
predictions of a simple coevolution picture, although the agreement is not
perfect. These demonstration clearly shows a failure of the local bias model
even at such large scales, and we conclude that nonlocal bias terms should be
consistently included in order to model statistics of halos. [abridged]

reach perihelion distances $q < 1.3$ au, and that also fulfill the conditions
of approaching or crossing Jupiter's orbit (aphelion distances $Q > 4.8$ au),
having Tisserand parameters $2 < T < 3$ and orbital periods $P < 20$ yr. In
order to compare the dynamics, we also analyze a sample of 42 Jupiter family
comets (JFCs) in near-Earth orbits, i.e. with $q < 1.3$ au. We integrated the
orbits of these two samples for $10^4$ yr in the past and in the future. We
find that the great majority of the NEAs move on stable orbits during the
considered period, and that a large proportion of them are in one of the main
mean motion resonances with Jupiter, in particular the 2:1. We find a strong
coupling between the perihelion distance and the inclination in the motion of
most NEAs, due to Kozai mechanism, that generates many sungrazers. On the other
hand, most JFCs are found to move on very unstable orbits, showing large
variations in their perihelion distances in the last few $10^2 - 10^3$ yr,
which suggests a rather recent capture in their current near-Earth orbits. Even
though most NEAs of our sample move in typical 'asteroidal' orbits, we detect a
small group of NEAs whose orbits are highly unstable, resembling those of the
JFCs. These are: 1997 SE5, 2000 DN1, 2001 XQ, 2002 GJ8, 2002 RN38, 2003 CC11,

indeed 2003 WY25 has been associated with comet Blanpain, and it is now
designed as comet 289P/Blanpain. Under the assumption that these objects are
inactive comets, we can set an upper limit of $\sim 0.17$ to the fraction of
NEAs with $Q > 4.8$ au of cometary origin, but it could be even lower if the
NEAs in unstable orbits listed before turn out to be {\it bona fide} asteroids

random gradient models with disorder. In model (A) the interface feels a bulk
term of random fields while in model (B) the disorder enters though the
potential acting on the gradients. We assume a general distribution on the
disorder with uniformly-bounded finite second moments.
  It is well known that for gradient models without disorder there are no Gibbs
measures in infinite-volume in dimension $d = 2$, while there are
shift-invariant gradient Gibbs measures describing an infinite-volume
distribution for the gradients of the field, as was shown by Funaki and Spohn.
Van Enter and Kuelske proved in 2008 that adding a disorder term as in model
(A) prohibits the existence of such gradient Gibbs measures for general
interaction potentials in $d = 2$. In Cotar and Kuelske (2012) we proved the
existence of shift-covariant random gradient Gibbs measures for model (A) when
$d\geq 3$, the disorder is i.i.d and has mean zero, and for model (B) when
$d\geq 1$ and the disorder has stationary distribution.
  In the present paper, we prove existence and uniqueness of shift-covariant
random gradient Gibbs measures with a given expected tilt $u\in R^d$ and with
the corresponding annealed measure being ergodic: for model (A) when $d\geq 3$
and the disordered random fields are i.i.d. and symmetrically-distributed, and
for model (B) when $d\geq 1$ and for any stationary disorder dependence
structure. We also compute for both models for any gradient Gibbs measure
constructed as in Cotar and Kuelske (2012), when the disorder is i.i.d. and its
distribution satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality assumption, the optimal decay of
covariances with respect to the averaged-over-the-disorder gradient Gibbs
measure.

temperature we observe a decrease in the superflare rate, which is analogous to
the previous findings of a decrease in dynamo activity with increasing
effective temperature. For slowly rotating stars, we find a quadratic increase
of the mean occurrence rate with the rotation rate up to a critical point,
after which the rate decreases linearly. Motivated by standard dynamo theory,
we study the behavior of the relative starspot coverage, approximated as the
relative brightness variation. For faster rotating stars, an increased fraction
of stars shows higher spot coverage, which leads to higher superflare rates. A
turbulent dynamo is used to study the dependence of the Ohmic dissipation as a
proxy of the flare energy on the differential rotation or shear rate. The
resulting statistics of the dissipation energy as a function of dynamo number
is similar to the observed flare statistics as a function of the inverse Rossby
number and shows similarly strong fluctuations. This supports the idea that
superflares might well be possible for solar-type G stars.

derived in the limit of infinite Prandtl number using the background method. We
demonstrate that the exponent in this bound cannot be improved on using a
piece-wise monotonic background temperature profile like the one used here.
This is true for finite Prandtl numbers as well, i.e. $Nu \lesssim Ra^3$ is the
best upper bound for this particular setup of the background method. The
feature that obstructs the availability of a better bound in this case is the
appearance of small-scale thermal plumes emanating from (or entering) the
thermal boundary layer.

examples of probability-preserving dynamical systems. A point in the state
spaces consists of a walk-trajectory and a scenery, and its `motion'
corresponds to shifting the time-origin.
  These models were proposed as natural examples of non-Bernoulli
K-automorphisms by Adler, Ornstein and Weiss. This was proved in a famous
analysis by Kalikow using Ornstein's Very Weak Bernoulli characterization of
Bernoulli processes. Since then, various authors have generalized this
construction to give other examples, including some smooth examples due to
Katok and Rudolph.
  However, the methods used to prove non-Bernoullicity do not obviously show
that these examples are distinct from one another. This paper introduces a new
isomorphism-invariant of probability-preserving systems, and shows that in a
large class of the above examples it essentially captures the Kolmogorov-Sinai
entropy of the scenery process alone. As a result, constructions that use
different scenery-entropies give continuum-many non-isomorphic examples.
Conditionally on an invariance principle for certain local times, these include
a continuum of distinct smooth non-Bernoulli K-automorphisms on a fixed compact
manifold.

localization (MBL), a remarkable phenomena characterized by an absence of

disorder is increased, one expects that an MBL phase will eventually undergo a
dynamical phase transition to a delocalized phase. Here we constrain the nature
of such a transition by exploiting the strong subadditivity of entanglement
entropy, as applied to the many-body eigenstates close to the transition in
general dimensions. In particular, we show that at a putative continuous
transition between an MBL and an ergodic delocalized phase, the critical
eigenstates are necessarily thermal, and therefore, the critical entanglement
entropy equals the thermal entropy. We also explore a qualitatively different
continuous localization-delocalization transition, where the delocalized phase
is non-ergodic whose volume law entanglement entropy tends to zero as the
transition is approached.

observation of $Y$. In particular, the principal inertia components bear an
interpretation as filter coefficients in the linear transformation of

conjecture that the mutual information between $f(X)$ and $Y$ is maximized when
all the principal inertia components have equal value. We also study the role

that are either in or close to the penumbra to the photosphere a few Mms away
from the sunspot. They reach less than 1 Mm in height. The other half of the
fibrils rise with distance from the sunspot until they leave the Ca II IR
formation height. Many of the fibrils show a central dark core and two lateral
brightenings as seen in line-core intensity images. The corresponding velocity
image shows fibrils that are as wide as the fibrils seen in intensity without a
lateral substructure. Additionally, we study one example of exceptional
brightness in more detail. It belongs to a different class of structures
without prominent mass flows and with a 3D topology formed by two parallel,
closed loops connecting patches of opposite polarity. We present evidence that
the inverse Evershed flow into the sunspot in the lower chromosphere is the
consequence of siphon flows along short loops that connect photospheric foot
points. The dark-cored structure of the chromospheric fibrils cannot have an
convective origin because of their location above regular granulation in an
optically thin atmosphere. The dark core most likely results from an opacity
difference between the central axis and the lateral edges caused by the
significant flow speed along the fibrils.

near-cliques. There exists a dichotomy between the results in the existing work
related to this problem: on the one hand the densest subgraph problem (DSP)
which maximizes the average degree over all subgraphs is solvable in polynomial
time but for many networks fails to find subgraphs which are near-cliques. On
the other hand, formulations that are geared towards finding near-cliques are
NP-hard and frequently inapproximable due to connections with the Maximum
Clique problem.
  In this work, we propose a formulation which combines the best of both
worlds: it is solvable in polynomial time and finds near-cliques when the DSP
fails. Surprisingly, our formulation is a simple variation of the DSP.
Specifically, we define the triangle densest subgraph problem (TDSP): given
$G(V,E)$, find a subset of vertices $S^*$ such that $\tau(S^*)=\max_{S
\subseteq V} \frac{t(S)}{|S|}$, where $t(S)$ is the number of triangles induced
by the set $S$. We provide various exact and approximation algorithms which the
solve the TDSP efficiently. Furthermore, we show how our algorithms adapt to
the more general problem of maximizing the $k$-clique average density. Finally,
we provide empirical evidence that the TDSP should be used whenever the output
of the DSP fails to output a near-clique.

(ncFET). Its operation is similar to that of a Tunnelling Field Effect
Transistor (TFET) with two barriers in series. The tunnelling barriers are
fabricated in very thin silicon dioxyde and the channel in intrinsic
polycrystalline silicon. The absence of doping eliminates the problem of
achieving sharp doping profiles at the junctions, which has proven a challenge
for large-scale integration and in principle allows scaling down the atomic
level. The demonstrated ncFET features a 10$^4$ on/off current ratio at room
temperature, a low 30 pA/$\mu$m leakage current at a 0.5 V bias, an on-state
current on a par with typical all-Si TFETs and bipolar operation with high
symmetry. Quantum dot transport spectroscopy is used to assess the band
structure and energy levels of the silicon island.

  In this paper, a relaxation is employed to nonconvex alternating minimization

  A generic measurement matrix can be standardized to a matrix consisting of
orthonormal columns. To recover the rank-one matrix, the standardized frames
are used to select the matrix with the maximal leading eigenvalue among the
rank-$r$ matrices. Empirical studies are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of this relaxation approach. In the case of Gaussian random

that the singular vector corresponding to the least singular value is close to
the unknown signal, and thus it can be a good initialization for the nonconvex
minimization algorithm.

vertices $u$ and $v$ are adjacent in $G^2$ if the distance between $u$ and $v$
in $G$ is at most 2. Let $\chi(H)$ and $\chi_{\ell}(H)$ be the chromatic number
and the list chromatic number of $H$, respectively. A graph $H$ is called {\em
chromatic-choosable} if $\chi_{\ell} (H) = \chi(H)$. It is an interesting
problem to find graphs that are chromatic-choosable.
  Motivated by the List Total Coloring Conjecture, Kostochka and Woodall (2001)
proposed the List Square Coloring Conjecture which states that $G^2$ is
chromatic-choosable for every graph $G$. Recently, Kim and Park showed that the
List Square Coloring Conjecture does not hold in general by finding a family of
graphs whose squares are complete multipartite graphs with partite sets of
unbounded size. It is a well-known fact that the List Total Coloring Conjecture
is true if the List Square Coloring Conjecture holds for special class of
bipartite graphs. On the other hand, the counterexamples to the List Square
Coloring Conjecture are not bipartite graphs. Hence a natural question is
whether $G^2$ is chromatic-choosable or not for every bipartite graph $G$.
  In this paper, we give a bipartite graph $G$ such that $\chi_{\ell} (G^2)
\neq \chi(G^2)$. Moreover, we show that the value $\chi_{\ell}(G^2) -
\chi(G^2)$ can be arbitrarily large.

almost a constant while within which a disk is formed and the angular momentum
roughly follows the Keplerian distribution. In this paper, we perform numerical
simulations to study whether the picture above is correct in the context of hot
accretion flow. We find that for a steady accretion flow, the ""circularization
radius"" does not exist and the angular momentum profile will be smooth
throughout the flow. However, for transient accretion systems, such as the
tidal disruption of a star by a black hole, a ""turning point"" should exist in
the radial profile of the angular momentum, which is conceptually similar to
the ""circularization radius"". At this radius, the viscous timescale equals the
life time of the accretion event. The specific angular momentum is close to
Keplerian within this radius, while beyond this radius the angular momentum is
roughly constant.

eclipsing binaries, or transiting planets. We find 178 Kepler M-star targets

of the 178 systems exhibit two or more independent short periods within the
same Kepler photometric aperture, while several have three or more short
periods. Adaptive optics imaging and modeling of the Kepler pixel response
function for a subset of our sample support the conclusion that the targets
with multiple periods are highly likely to be relatively young physical binary,
triple, and even quadruple M star systems. We explore in detail the one object
with four incommensurate periods all less than 1.2 days, and show that two of
the periods arise from one of a close pair of stars, while the other two arise
from the second star, which itself is probably a visual binary. If most of
these M-star systems with multiple periods turn out to be bound M stars, this
could prove a valuable way of discovering young hierarchical M-star systems;
the same approach may also be applicable to G and K stars. The ~5% occurrence
rate of rapid rotation among the ~3900 M star targets is consistent with spin

problems in various areas of science. Subgradient projection methods are
important tools for solving the CFP because they enable the use of subgradient
calculations instead of orthogonal projections onto the individual sets of the
problem. Working in a real Hilbert space, we show that the sequential
subgradient projection method is perturbation resilient. By this we mean that
under appropriate conditions the sequence generated by the method converges
weakly, and sometimes also strongly, to a point in the intersection of the
given subsets of the feasibility problem, despite certain perturbations which
are allowed in each iterative step. Unlike previous works on solving the convex
feasibility problem, the involved functions, which induce the feasibility
problem's subsets, need not be convex. Instead, we allow them to belong to a
wider and richer class of functions satisfying a weaker condition, that we call
""zero-convexity"". This class, which is introduced and discussed here, holds a
promise to solve optimization problems in various areas, especially in
non-smooth and non-convex optimization. The relevance of this study to
approximate minimization and to the recent superiorization methodology for
constrained optimization is explained.

estimate only one parameter of the geometry close to the compact object, and
therefore it is not possible to get independent measurements of both the spin

break the degeneracy between the spin and possible deviations from the Kerr

parallels with information theory. We consider Vapnik's General Setting of
Learning in which the learning process is defined to be the act of selecting a
hypothesis in response to a given training set. Such hypothesis can, for
example, be a decision boundary in classification, a set of centroids in
clustering, or a set of frequent item-sets in association rule mining.
Depending on the hypothesis space and how the final hypothesis is selected, we
show that a learning process can be assigned a numeric score, called learning
capacity, which is analogous to Shannon's channel capacity and satisfies
similar interesting properties as well such as the data-processing inequality
and the information-cannot-hurt inequality. In addition, learning capacity
provides the tightest possible bound on the difference between true risk and
empirical risk of the learning process for all loss functions that are
parametrized by the chosen hypothesis. It is also shown that the notion of
learning capacity equivalently quantifies how sensitive the choice of the final
hypothesis is to a small perturbation in the training set. Consequently,
algorithmic stability is both necessary and sufficient for generalization.
While the theory does not rely on concentration inequalities, we finally show
that analogs to classical results in learning theory using the Probably
Approximately Correct (PAC) model can be immediately deduced using this theory,
and conclude with information-theoretic bounds to learning capacity.

CPC provides a natural language to express trade where information exchange is
pivotal to interaction. The unification allows some patterns to be more

Thoroughly rewritten version",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When investigating theories at the tiniest conceivable scales in nature,
almost all researchers today revert to the quantum language, accepting the
verdict from the Copenhagen doctrine that the only way to describe what is
going on will always involve states in Hilbert space, controlled by operator
equations. Returning to classical, that is, non quantum mechanical,
descriptions will be forever impossible, unless one accepts some extremely
contrived theoretical constructions that may or may not reproduce the quantum
mechanical phenomena observed in experiments.
  Dissatisfied, this author investigated how one can look at things
differently. This book is an overview of older material, but also contains many
new observations and calculations. Quantum mechanics is looked upon as a tool,
not as a theory. Examples are displayed of models that are classical in
essence, but can be analysed by the use of quantum techniques, and we argue
that even the Standard Model, together with gravitational interactions, might
be viewed as a quantum mechanical approach to analyse a system that could be
classical at its core. We explain how such thoughts can conceivably be
reconciled with Bell's theorem, and how the usual objections voiced against the
notion of `superdeterminism' can be overcome, at least in principle. Our
proposal would eradicate the collapse problem and the measurement problem. Even
the existence of an ""arrow of time"" can perhaps be explained in a more elegant
way than usual.

physics definition of free will, and an unconventional view on the arrow of

  Rees' result is a generalization of Zariski's product theorem for complete
ideals in a regular local ring of dimension two.
  The aim of this paper is to extend Rees' theorem for the ordinary powers of
$\m$-primary ideals $I$ and $J$ in a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension
two.
  Following Rees' approach,
  we define the modified Koszul homology modules $M^1_{r,s}(a^k,b^k)$ for a
joint reduction $(a,b)$ of $I$ and $J$.
  Under the additional assumption that the associated graded rings of $I$ and
$J$ have positive depth, we obtain a characterization of the joint reduction
number zero of $I$ and $J$ in terms of the vanishing of the module
$M^1_{0,0}(a,b)$, as well as in terms of the Hilbert coefficients and the
bigraded Hilbert coefficients. More generally, we introduce the joint reduction
lattice and study the vanishing of $M^1_{r,s}(a,b)$ for any $r, s \geq 0$. This
gives a characterization for a vector $(r,s)$ to be in the joint reduction
lattice of $I$ and $J$. We also give a cohomological interpretation of these
theorems by investigating the local cohomology modules of the bigraded extended
Rees algebra. This gives another characterization for a vector $(r,s)$ to be in
the joint reduction lattice and also extends a recent result of Masuti and
Verma in \cite{masuti-verma} for ordinary powers of ideals.

fall of different QTF are in conformity with third law of thermodynamics. But,
the sensitiveness of decay i.e. the power of the power law decay explicitly
depends on $\mu(\omega)$. We also separately discuss the influence of
confinement and magnetic field on the low temperature behavior of different
QTF. In this process we demonstrate how to control low temperature behaviour of
anomalous dissipative quantum systems by varying confining length $a$, $B$ and
the temperature $T$. Momentum dissipation reduces effective mass of the system

  near the critical line","PhD thesis",,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the value-distribution of the Riemann zeta-function and related
functions on and near the critical line. Amongst others, we focus on the
following:
  The critical line is a natural boundary of the Voronin-type universality
property of the Riemann zeta-function. We study a modified concept of
`universality' at the critical line: roughly speaking, we add a scaling factor
to the vertical shifts that appear in Voronin's universality theorem.
  Levinson showed that almost all a-points of the Riemann zeta-function lie in
a certain funnel-shaped region around the critical line. We rely on arguments
of the theory of normal families and the notion of filling discs to detect
a-points in this region which are very close to the critical line.
  According to a folklore conjecture (often attributed to Ramachandra) one
expects that the values of the Riemann zeta-function on the critical line lie
dense in the complex numbers. We show that there are certain curves which
approach the critical line asymptotically such that the values of the
zeta-function on these curves are dense in the complex numbers.
  The Lindel\""of hypothesis can be reformulated in terms of power moments to
the right of the critical line. Tanaka showed recently that the expected
asymptotic formulas for these power moments are true in a certain
measure-theoretical sense. We provide a discrete and integrated version of
Tanaka's result and extend it to a large class of Dirichlet series connected to
the Riemann zeta-function.

(CMB); it could be of primordial origin, or caused by a intervening structure
along the line of sight. We identified a large projected underdensity in the
recently constructed WISE-2MASS all-sky infrared galaxy catalogue aligned with
the Cold Spot direction at $(l,b)\approx(209^\circ,-57^\circ)$. It has an
angular size of tens of degrees, and shows a $\sim20\%$ galaxy underdensity in
the center. Moreover, we find another large underdensity in the projected
WISE-2MASS galaxy map at $(l,b)\approx(101^\circ,46^\circ)$ (hereafter Draco
Supervoid), also aligned with a CMB decrement, although less significant than
that of the CS direction. Motivated by these findings, we develop spherically
symmetric Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) compensated void models to explain the
observed CMB decrements with these two underdensities, or ""supervoids"". Within
our perturbative treatment of the LTB voids, we find that the Integrated
Sachs-Wolfe and Riess-Sciama effects due to the Draco Supervoid can account for
the CMB decrement observed in the same direction. On the contrary, the
extremely deep CMB decrement in the CS direction is more difficult to explain
by the presence of the CS supervoid only. Nevertheless, the probability of a
random alignment between the CS and the corresponding supervoid is disfavored,

Smart Grid which will be a corner stone to build sustainable energy efficient
communities. An integral part of the future Smart Grid will be the
communications infrastructure which will make real time control of the grid

key enabler for monitoring and controlling the customer loads. %RPL is a
connectivity enabling mechanism for low power and lossy networks currently
being standardized by the IETF ROLL working group. RPL is deemed to be a
suitable candidate for AMI networks where the meters are connected to a
concentrator over multi hop low power and lossy links. This paper proposes an
efficient cooperative anycasting approach for wireless mesh networks with the
aim of achieving reduced traffic and increased utilisation of the network
resources. The proposed cooperative anycasting has been realised as an
enhancement on top of the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks
(RPL), a connectivity enabling mechanism in wireless AMI mesh networks. In this
protocol, smart meter nodes utilise an anycasting approach to facilitate
efficient transport of metering data to the concentrator node. Moreover, it
takes advantage of a distributed approach ensuring scalability.

did not identify any new comoving companions. The survey also led to spatially

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya spin-orbit interaction. In the presence of a sufficiently
large applied magnetic field, such skyrmions are large amplitude excitations of
the field-polarized magnetic state. We investigate analytically the interaction
between such a skyrmion excitation and its small amplitude fluctuations, i.e.,
the magnons in a clean two-dimensional chiral magnet. The magnon spectrum is
found to include two magnon-skyrmion bound states corresponding to a breathing
mode and, for intermediate fields, a quadrupolar mode, which will give rise to
subgap magnetic and electric resonances. Due to the skyrmion topology, the
magnons scatter from a Aharonov-Bohm flux density that leads to skew and
rainbow scattering, characterized by an asymmetric differential cross section
with, in general, multiple peaks. As a consequence of the skew scattering, a
finite density of skyrmions will generate a topological magnon Hall effect.
Using the conservation law for the energy-momentum tensor, we demonstrate that
the magnons also transfer momentum to the skyrmion. As a consequence, a magnon
current leads to magnon pressure reflected in a momentum-transfer force in the
Thiele equation of motion for the skyrmion. This force is reactive and governed
by the scattering cross sections of the skyrmion; it causes not only a finite
skyrmion velocity but also a large skyrmion Hall effect. Our results provide,
in particular, the basis for a theory of skyrmion caloritronics for a dilute

to be $(1.54 \pm 0.04 \pm 0.11) \times 10^{-4}$. This is the most precise

quantities for compact binaries exhibit a combinatorial increase in complexity,
including ever-increasing numbers of transcendentals. Here we consider the
gravitational wave energy flux at infinity from a point particle in a circular
orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole, which is known to 22PN beyond the
lowest-order Newtonian prediction, at which point each order has over 1000
terms. We introduce a factorization that considerably simplifies the spherical
harmonic modes of the energy flux (and thus also the amplitudes of the
spherical harmonic modes of the gravitational waves); it is likely that much of
the complexity this factorization removes is due to curved-space wave
propagation (e.g., tail effects). For the modes with azimuthal number l of 7 or
greater, this factorization reduces the expressions for the modes that enter
the 22PN total energy flux to pure integer PN series with rational
coefficients, which amounts to a reduction of up to a factor of ~150 in the
total number of terms in a given mode. The reduction in complexity becomes less
dramatic for smaller l, due to the structure of the expansion, though the
factorization is still able to remove all the half-integer PN terms. For the
22PN l = 2 modes, this factorization still reduces the total number of terms
(and size) by a factor of ~10 and gives purely rational coefficients through
8PN. This factorization also improves the convergence of the series, though we
find the exponential resummation introduced for the full energy flux by Isoyama
et al. to be even more effective at improving the convergence of the individual
modes, producing improvements of over four orders of magnitude over the
original series for some modes. However, the exponential resummation is not as
effective at simplifying the series, particularly for the higher-order modes.

described by interdependent networks. The interdependence between networks
significantly affects the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation on them.
Meanwhile, due to the diversity and complexity of social and biological
systems, players on different networks may not interact with each other by the
same way, which should be described by multiple models in evolutionary game
theory, such as the Prisoner's Dilemma and Snowdrift Game. We therefore study
the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation on two interdependent networks playing
different games respectively. We clearly evidence that, with the increment of
network interdependence, the evolution of cooperation is dramatically promoted
on the network playing Prisoner's Dilemma. The cooperation level of the network
playing Snowdrift Game reduces correspondingly, although it is almost
invisible. In particular, there exists an optimal intermediate region of
network interdependence maximizing the growth rate of the evolution of
cooperation on the network playing Prisoner's Dilemma. Remarkably, players
contacting with other network have advantage in the evolution of cooperation
than the others on the same network.

the extent, structure, and kinematics of the BLR is to study the continuum and
line profile variability in AGN. We selected the radio-loud Seyfert 1 galaxy 3C
120 as a target for this study. We took spectra with a high signal-to-noise
ratio of 3C 120 with the 9.2m Hobby-Eberly Telescope between Sept. 2008 and
March 2009. In parallel, we photometrically monitored the continuum flux at the
Wise observatory. We analyzed the continuum and line profile variations in
detail (1D and 2D reverberation mapping) and modeled the geometry of the
line-emitting regions based on the line profiles. We show that the BLR in 3C
120 is stratified with respect to the distance of the line-emitting regions
from the center with respect to the line widths (FWHM) of the rms profiles and
with respect to the variability amplitude of the emission lines. The emission
line wings of H{\alpha} and H{\beta} respond much faster than their central
region. This is explained by accretion disk models. In addition, these lines
show a stronger response in the red wings. However, the velocity-delay maps of
the helium lines show a stronger response in the blue wing. Furthermore, the
HeII{\lambda}4686 line responds faster in the blue wing in contradiction to
observations made one and a half years later when the galaxy was in a lower
state. The faster response in the blue wing is an indication for central
outflow motions when this galaxy was in a bright state during our observations.
The vertical BLR structure in 3C 120 coincides with that of other AGN. We
confirm the general trend: the emission lines of narrow line AGN originate at
larger distances from the midplane than AGN with broader emission lines.

  O(He)-type stars","29 pages, 27 figures, accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201423498",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  About a quarter of all post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are
hydrogen-deficient. Stellar evolutionary models explain the carbon-dominated
H-deficient stars by a (very) late thermal pulse scenario where the
hydrogen-rich envelope is mixed with the helium-rich intershell layer.
Depending on the particular time at which the final flash occurs, the entire
hydrogen envelope may be burned. In contrast, helium-dominated post-AGB stars
and their evolution are yet not understood. A small group of very hot,
helium-dominated stars is formed by O(He)-type stars. We performed a detailed
spectral analysis of ultraviolet and optical spectra of four O(He) stars by
means of state-of-the-art non-LTE model-atmosphere techniques. We determined
effective temperatures, surface gravities, and the abundances of H, He, C, N,
O, F, Ne, Si, P, S, Ar, and Fe. By deriving upper limits for the mass-loss
rates of the O(He) stars, we found that they do not exhibit enhanced mass-loss.
The comparison with evolutionary models shows that the status of the O(He)
stars remains uncertain. Their abundances match predictions of a double helium
white dwarf merger scenario, suggesting that they might be the progeny of the
compact and of the luminous helium-rich sdO-type stars. The existence of
planetary nebulae that do not show helium enrichment around every other O(He)
star, precludes a merger origin for these stars. These stars must have formed
in a different way, for instance via enhanced mass-loss during their post-AGB
evolution or a merger within a common-envelope (CE) of a CO-WD and a red giant
or AGB star. A helium-dominated stellar evolutionary sequence exists, that may
be fed by different types of mergers or CE scenarios. It appears likely, that
all these pass through the O(He) phase just before they become white dwarfs.

framework has been applied to study the complexity of the differential operator
and the complexity of functionals over the space of continuous functions on the

to the product space of the real numbers endowed with the product topology. We
show that no computable norm can be defined over such topology. We investigate
computability and complexity of total functions over the product space in two
cases: (1) when the computing machine submits a uniformally bounded number of
queries to the oracle and (2) when the number of queries submitted by the
machine is not uniformally bounded. In the first case we show that the function
over the product space can be reduced to a function over a finite-dimensional
space. However, in general there exists functions whose computing machines must
submit a non-uniform number of queries to the oracle indicating that computing
over the product topology can not in general be reduced to computing over
finite-dimensional spaces.

of topological insulator nanowires based on Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3 and Bi2Se3 as a
function of diameter and Fermi level. We show that the thermoelectric

systems the competition between surface states and bulk channel causes a
significant modification of the thermoelectric transport coefficients if the
diameter is reduced into the sub-10 um range. Key aspects are that the surface

polarity as well as the high surface to volume ratio of the nanowires. This
limits the maximum thermoelectric performance of topological insulator
nanowires and thus their application in efficient thermoelectric devices.

varies considerably (0-12%) with one friable example having porosity around
50%. At higher velocities, the range of meteoroid porosity narrows, but average
porosity increases (to 16-27%) due to volatile evaporation and partial melting
(scoriaceous phase). Metal distribution seems to be mostly unaffected at this
stage. At even higher entry velocities, complete melting follows the
scoriaceous phase. Complete melting is accompanied by metal oxidation and
redistribution, loss of porosity (1 $\pm$ 1%), and narrowing of the bulk (3.2

Lagrangian the coupled-channel partial-wave scattering amplitudes have to be

of the various scattering amplitudes into suitable sets of invariant functions
expected to satisfy Mandelstam's dispersion-integral representation is
presented. Sets are identified that are free from kinematical constraints and
that can be computed efficiently in terms of a novel projection algebra. From
such a representation one can deduce the analytic structure of the partial-wave

amplitudes are kinematically constrained at the Kibble conditions. Therefore an
application of a dispersion-integral representation is prohibitively
cumbersome. We derive covariant partial-wave amplitudes that are free from
kinematical constraints at the Kibble conditions. They correspond to specific
polynomials in the 4-momenta and Dirac matrices that solve the various
Bethe-Salpeter equations in the presence of short-range interactions

addition to our main results, we include at the end a number of open questions.

However, quantifying the strength of evidence for selection acting on a
particular trait is a difficult task. Here we develop a population-genetic test
for selection acting on a quantitative trait which is based on multiple-line
crosses. We show that using multiple lines increases both the power and the
scope of selection inference. First, a test based on three or more lines
detects selection with strongly increased statistical significance, and we show
explicitly how the sensitivity of the test depends on the number of lines.
Second, a multiple-line test allows to distinguish different lineage-specific
selection scenarios. Our analytical results are complemented by extensive
numerical simulations. We then apply the multiple-line test to QTL data on
floral character traits in plant species of the Mimulus genus and on
photoperiodic traits in different maize strains, where we find a signatures of
lineage-specific selection not seen in a two-line test.

some may cooperate, while others may not. Since individual factors promoting
cooperation could be used by institutions to indirectly prime cooperation, this
heterogeneity raises the important question of who these cooperators are. We
have conducted a series of experiments to study whether benevolence, defined as
a unilateral act of paying a cost to increase the welfare of someone else
beyond one's own, is related to cooperation in a subsequent one-shot anonymous
Prisoner's dilemma. Contrary to the predictions of the widely used inequity
aversion models, we find that benevolence does exist and a large majority of
people behave this way. We also find benevolence to be correlated with
cooperative behaviour. Finally, we show a causal link between benevolence and
cooperation: priming people to think positively about benevolent behaviour
makes them significantly more cooperative than priming them to think
malevolently. Thus benevolent people exist and cooperate more.

review six different experiments: ARPES, quantum oscillations, neutron

Kerr effect and ultrasonics) that require verification, yet they offer new

some constraining comments on the microscopic models that rely on localised

rate surface density, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$. This result is based on wide field
and high sensitivity CO(3-2) observations at 100 pc resolution. Star formation
efficiencies (SFE), defined as $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$/$\Sigma_{\rm H_2}$, in GHRs
are found to be about 1 dex higher than in other disk regions. The
CO(3-2)/CO(1-0) integrated intensity ratio is also higher than the average over

starburst galaxies, which suggests that GHRs may be the elements building up a
larger scale starburst region. Three possible contributions to high SFEs in GHR
are investigated: (1) the $I_{CO}$-$N({\rm H_2})$ conversion factor, (2) the
dense gas fraction traced by CO(3-2)/CO(1-0), and (3) the initial mass function

existing synthesis methods with partial observation to be applicable and

counterexamples, which witness unrealizability potentially due to the
limitations in sensing and the coarseness in the abstract system, and
interpolation-based techniques to refine the model and the sensing modalities,

double-well supersymmetric matrix model in its double scaling limit, which
corresponds to two-dimensional type IIA superstring theory on a nontrivial
Ramond-Ramond background. To this end we draw upon the wisdom of random matrix
theory developed by Tracy and Widom, which expresses the largest eigenvalue
distribution of unitary ensembles in terms of a Painleve II transcendent.
Regularity of the result at any value of the string coupling constant shows
that the third-order phase transition between a supersymmetry-preserving phase
and a supersymmetry-broken phase, previously found at the planar level, becomes
a smooth crossover in the double scaling limit. Accordingly, the supersymmetry
is always broken spontaneously as its order parameter stays nonzero for the
whole region of the coupling constant. Coincidence of the result with the
unitary one-matrix model suggests that one-dimensional type 0 string theories
partially correspond to the type IIA superstring theory. Our formulation
naturally allows for introduction of an instanton chemical potential, and
reveals the presence of a novel phase transition, possibly interpreted as
condensation of instantons.

on the trace-distance as quantifier of the disturbance. We discuss connections
with entanglement and previously defined notions of quantumness of

studied extensively in (standard) graphs. In particular, fast (i.e.,
logarithmic run time) randomized algorithms are well-established for MIS and
$\Delta +1$-coloring in both the LOCAL and CONGEST distributed computing
models. On the other hand, comparatively much less is known on the complexity
of distributed symmetry breaking in {\em hypergraphs}. In particular, a key
question is whether a fast (randomized) algorithm for MIS exists for
hypergraphs.
  In this paper, we study the distributed complexity of symmetry breaking in
hypergraphs by presenting distributed randomized algorithms for a variety of
fundamental problems under a natural distributed computing model for
hypergraphs. We first show that MIS in hypergraphs (of arbitrary dimension) can
be solved in $O(\log^2 n)$ rounds ($n$ is the number of nodes of the
hypergraph) in the LOCAL model. We then present a key result of this paper ---
an $O(\Delta^{\epsilon}\text{polylog}(n))$-round hypergraph MIS algorithm in
the CONGEST model where $\Delta$ is the maximum node degree of the hypergraph
and $\epsilon > 0$ is any arbitrarily small constant.
  To demonstrate the usefulness of hypergraph MIS, we present applications of
our hypergraph algorithm to solving problems in (standard) graphs. In
particular, the hypergraph MIS yields fast distributed algorithms for the {\em
balanced minimal dominating set} problem (left open in Harris et al. [ICALP

distributed algorithms for coloring, maximal matching, and maximal clique in

discrepancy measures of point sets. After providing an introduction which puts
the calculation of discrepancy measures in a more general context, we focus on
the geometric discrepancy measures for which computation algorithms have been
designed. In particular, we explain methods to determine $L_2$-discrepancies
and approaches to tackle the inherently difficult problem to calculate the star
discrepancy of given sample sets. We also discuss in more detail three
applications of algorithms to approximate discrepancies.

and broad-lined Ic. All of these types are attributed to the core collapse of
massive stars, with varying degrees of intact H and He envelopes before
explosion. The SNe in our sample have a mean redshift <cz> = 4200 km/s. Most of
these spectra were gathered at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
(CfA) between 2004 and 2009. For 53 SNe, these are the first published spectra.
The data coverage range from mere identification (1-3 spectra) for a few SNe to
extensive series of observations (10-30 spectra) that trace the spectral
evolution for others, with an average of 9 spectra per SN. For 44 SNe of the 73
SNe presented here, we have well-determined dates of maximum light to determine
the phase of each spectrum. Our sample constitutes the most extensive spectral
library of stripped-envelope SNe to date. We provide very early coverage (as
early as 30 days before V-band max) for photospheric spectra, as well as
late-time nebular coverage when the innermost regions of the SNe are visible
(as late as 2 years after explosion, while for SN1993J, we have data as late as
11.6 years). This data set has homogeneous observations and reductions that
allow us to study the spectroscopic diversity of these classes of stripped SNe
and to compare these to SNe associated with gamma-ray bursts. We undertake
these matters in follow-up papers.

reaction dynamics induced by antiprotons. The reaction channels of elastic
scattering, annihilation, charge exchange and inelastic collisions have been
included in the model. Dynamics on particle production, in particular pions,
kaons, antikaons and hyperons, is investigated in collisions of $\overline{p}$
on $^{12}$C, $^{20}$Ne, $^{40}$Ca, $^{112}$Sn, $^{181}$Ta, $^{197}$Au and
$^{238}$U from a low to high incident momentum. The rapidity and momentum
distributions of $\pi^{+}$ and protons from the LEAR measurements can be well
reproduced. The impacts of system size and incident momentum on particle
emissions are investigated from the inclusive spectra, transverse momentum and
rapidity distributions. It is found that the annihilations of $\overline{p}$ on
nucleons are of importance on the particle production. Hyperons are mainly
produced via meson induced reactions on nucleons and strangeness exchange
collisions when the incident momentum is below the threshold value of
annihilation reaction. A higher nuclear temperature is obtained from the kaon
emission, but it has a lower value for hyperon production.

  Reflective Kratzer Oscillator","114 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper studies violation of conventional rules of SUSY quantum mechanics
for the centrifugal potential V(r) within the limit-circle (LC) range. A
special attention is given to transformation properties of the Titchmarsh-Weyl
m-function under Darboux deformations of the reflective Kratzer oscillator:
centrifugal Kepler-Coulomb (KC) potential plus a Taylor series in r. Since our
analysis is based on Fulton's representation of a regular-at-infinity solution
[Math. Nachr. 281, 1418 (2008)] as a superposition of two Frobenius solutions
at the origin, we refer to the appropriate expressions as the
Titchmarsh-Weyl-Fulton (TWF) functions. Explicit transformation relations are
derived for partner TWF functions associated with SUSY pairs of centrifugal
potentials. It is shown that these relations have a completely different form
for Darboux transformations (DTs) keeping the potential within the LC range.
  As an illustration, we use regular nodeless Frobenius solutions to construct
SUSY partners of the radial r- and c-Gauss-reference (GRef) potentials solvable
via hypergeometric and confluent hypergeometric functions, respectively. We
explicitly demonstrate existence of non-isospectral partners of both radial
potentials in the LC region and obtain their discrete energy spectra using the
derived closed-form expressions for the TWF functions. The general
transformation relations for the TWF function have been verified taking
advantage of form-invariance of the radial GRef potentials under double-step
DTs with the so-called 'basic' seed solutions (SSs). Similarly we directly
ratify that TWF functions for three shape-invariant reflective potentials on
the half-line -- hyperbolic Poschl-Teller (h-PT), Eckart/Manning-Rosen (E/MR),
and centrifugal KC potentials - do retain their form under basic DTs.

persons read text labels and product packaging from hand-held objects in their
daily life. To isolate the object from untidy backgrounds or other surrounding
objects in the camera vision, we initially propose an efficient and effective
motion based method to define a region of interest (ROI) in the video by asking
the user to tremble the object. This scheme extracts moving object region by a
mixture-of-Gaussians-based background subtraction technique. In the extracted
ROI, text localization and recognition are conducted to acquire text details.
To automatically focus the text regions from the object ROI, we offer a novel
text localization algorithm by learning gradient features of stroke
orientations and distributions of edge pixels in an Adaboost model. Text
characters in the localized text regions are then binarized and recognized by
off-the-shelf optical character identification software. The renowned text
codes are converted into audio output to the blind users. Performance of the
suggested text localization algorithm is quantitatively evaluated on ICDAR-2003
and ICDAR-2011 Robust Reading Datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our algorithm achieves the highest level of developments at present time. The
proof-of-concept example is also evaluated on a dataset collected using ten
blind persons to evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme. We explore the user
interface issues and robustness of the algorithm in extracting and reading text
from different objects with complex backgrounds.

structure with fractional numbers of branches joined on one site. Although the
lattice is undrawable in real space, the concept is consistent with regular
Husimi lattice. The Ising spins of antiferromagnetic interaction on such a sets
of lattices were calculated to check the critical temperatures ($T_{c}$) and
ideal glass transition temperatures ($T_{k}$) variation with fractional branch
numbers. Besides the similar results of two solutions representing the stable
state (crystal) and metastable state (supercooled liquid) and indicating the
phase transition temperatures, the phase transitions show a well-defined shift
with branch number variation. Therefore the fractional branch number as a
parameter can be used as an adjusting tool in constructing a recursive lattice
model to describe real systems.
