massive members can affect the properties of other constituent solar systems.
This paper considers how clusters influence star formation and forming
planetary systems through nuclear enrichment from supernova explosions, where
massive stars deliver short-lived radioactive nuclei (SLRs) to their local
environment. The decay of these nuclei leads to both heating and ionization,
and thereby affects disk evolution, disk chemistry, and the accompanying
process of planet formation. Nuclear enrichment can take place on two spatial
scales: [1] Within the cluster itself ($\ell\sim1$pc), the SLRs are delivered
to the circumstellar disks associated with other cluster members. [2] On the
next larger scale ($\ell\sim2-10$pc), SLRs are injected into the background
molecular cloud; these nuclei provide heating and ionization to nearby
star-forming regions, and to the next generation of disks. For the first
scenario, we construct the expected distributions of radioactive enrichment
levels provided by embedded clusters. Clusters can account for the SLR mass
fractions inferred for the early Solar Nebula, but typical SLR abundances are
lower by a factor of $\sim10$. For the second scenario, we find that
distributed enrichment of SLRs in molecular clouds leads to comparable
abundances. For both the direct and distributed enrichment processes, the
masses of $^{26}$Al and $^{60}$Fe delivered to individual circumstellar disks
typically fall in the range $10-100pM_\odot$ (where
$1pM_\odot=10^{-12}M_\odot$). The corresponding ionization rate due to SLRs
typically falls in the range $\zeta_{SLR}\sim1-5\times10^{-19}$ sec$^{-1}$.
This ionization rate is smaller than that due to cosmic rays,
$\zeta_{CR}\sim10^{-17}$ sec$^{-1}$, but will be important in regions where
cosmic rays are attenuated (e.g., disk mid-planes).

direct searches at collider experiments. In the HTM, there appear
doubly-charged Higgs bosons $H^{\pm\pm}$, and detection of them is a key to
probe the model. The decay property of $H^{\pm\pm}$ depends on the magnitude of
the vacuum expectation value of the triplet field $v_\Delta$. When $v_\Delta$
is smaller than about 1 MeV, $H^{\pm\pm}$ can mainly decay into the same-sign

obtaining explicit solutions in general relativity, especially for the
relativistic two-body problem with arbitrary mass ratio. Within many of its
applications, it is often required to use a regularization procedure. Though
frequently misunderstood, the regularization is essential for waveform
generation without reference to the internal structure of orbiting bodies. In
recent years, direct comparison with the self-force approach, constructed
specifically for highly relativistic particles in the extreme mass ratio limit,
has enabled preliminary confirmation of the foundations of both computational
methods, including their very independent regularization procedures, with high
numerical precision. In this paper, we build upon earlier work to carry this
comparison still further, by examining next-to-next-to-leading order
contributions beyond the half integral 5.5PN conservative effect, which arise
from terms to cubic and higher orders in the metric and its multipole moments,
thus extending scrutiny of the post-Newtonian methods to one of the highest
orders yet achieved. We do this by explicitly constructing tail-of-tail terms
at 6.5PN and 7.5PN order, computing the redshift factor for compact binaries in
the small mass ratio limit, and comparing directly with numerically and
analytically computed terms in the self-force approach, obtained using
solutions for metric perturbations in the Schwarzschild space-time, and a
combination of exact series representations possibly with more typical PN
expansions. While self-force results may be relativistic but with restricted
mass ratio, our methods, valid primarily in the weak-field slowly-moving
regime, are nevertheless in principle applicable for arbitrary mass ratios.

and previous work has explored Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and MAP
approximations for learning and inference. This paper studies Gaussian
approximations to the CGM. As the population grows large, we show that the CGM
distribution converges to a multivariate Gaussian distribution (GCGM) that
maintains the conditional independence properties of the original CGM. If the
observations are exact marginals of the CGM or marginals that are corrupted by
Gaussian noise, inference in the GCGM approximation can be computed efficiently
in closed form. If the observations follow a different noise model (e.g.,
Poisson), then expectation propagation provides efficient and accurate
approximate inference. The accuracy and speed of GCGM inference is compared to
the MCMC and MAP methods on a simulated bird migration problem. The GCGM
matches or exceeds the accuracy of the MAP method while being significantly
faster.

via a generalization of Doob's $h$-transform, used in the context of bridge

the logarithmic equivalence of path measures and implies that the two processes
have the same typical states. In constructing the driven process, we also prove
equivalence with the so-called exponential tilting of the Markov process, which
is used with importance sampling to simulate rare events, and which gives rise,
from the point of view of statistical mechanics, to a nonequilibrium version of

ellipses from an image. The approach employs an evolutionary algorithm to mimic
the way animals behave collectively assuming the overall detection process as a
multi-modal optimization problem. In the algorithm, searcher agents emulate a
group of animals that interact to each other using simple biological rules
which are modeled as evolutionary operators. In turn, such operators are
applied to each agent considering that the complete group has a memory to store
optimal solutions (ellipses) seen so-far by applying a competition principle.
The detector uses a combination of five edge points as parameters to determine
ellipse candidates (possible solutions) while a matching function determines if
such ellipse candidates are actually present in the image. Guided by the values
of such matching functions, the set of encoded candidate ellipses are evolved
through the evolutionary algorithm so that the best candidates can be fitted
into the actual ellipses within the image. Just after the optimization process
ends, an analysis over the embedded memory is executed in order to find the
best obtained solution (the best ellipse) and significant local minima
(remaining ellipses). Experimental results over several complex synthetic and
natural images have validated the efficiency of the proposed technique
regarding accuracy, speed and robustness.

by reduced-order models. The method employs Gaussian-process regression to
construct a mapping from a small number of computationally inexpensive `error
indicators' to a distribution over the true error. The variance of this
distribution can be interpreted as the (epistemic) uncertainty introduced by
the reduced-order model. To model normed errors, the method employs existing
rigorous error bounds and residual norms as indicators; numerical experiments
show that the method leads to a near-optimal expected effectivity in contrast
to typical error bounds. To model errors in general outputs, the method uses
dual-weighted residuals---which are amenable to uncertainty control---as
indicators. Experiments illustrate that correcting the reduced-order-model
output with this surrogate can improve prediction accuracy by an order of
magnitude; this contrasts with existing `multifidelity correction' approaches,
which often fail for reduced-order models and suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. The proposed error surrogates also lead to a notion of
`probabilistic rigor', i.e., the surrogate bounds the error with specified
probability.

particularly well suited to solve problems featuring nonlinear and multimodal
cost functions. EMO employs searcher agents that emulate a population of
charged particles which interact to each other according to electromagnetisms
laws of attraction and repulsion. However, EMO usually requires a large number
of iterations for a local search procedure; any reduction or cancelling over
such number, critically perturb other issues such as convergence, exploration,
population diversity and accuracy. This paper presents an enhanced EMO
algorithm called OBEMO, which employs the Opposition-Based Learning (OBL)
approach to accelerate the global convergence speed. OBL is a machine
intelligence strategy which considers the current candidate solution and its
opposite value at the same time, achieving a faster exploration of the search
space. The proposed OBEMO method significantly reduces the required
computational effort yet avoiding any detriment to the good search capabilities
of the original EMO algorithm. Experiments are conducted over a comprehensive
set of benchmark functions, showing that OBEMO obtains promising performance
for most of the discussed test problems.

our framework yields as side product an extremely effective tool to handle and

the study of strongly correlated electron systems, since it allows to easily
identify fermionic degrees of freedom able to capture part of the correlations

analysis, also symmetry-based studies of the quantum Hamiltonians can be
improved, since the simple representation of the generators of the canonical

difficult interpretation. The main aim of this work is to provide a

By
preparing a system in a readily initialised state and then slowly changing its

inaccessible. Moreover, a judicious choice of final Hamiltonian whose
groundstate encodes the solution to a problem allows adiabatic transport to be
used for universal quantum computation. However, the dephasing effects of the
environment limit the quantum correlations that an open system can support and
degrade the power of such adiabatic computation. We quantify this effect by
allowing the system to evolve over a restricted set of quantum states,
providing a link between physically inspired classical optimisation algorithms
and quantum adiabatic optimisation. This new perspective allows us to develop
benchmarks to bound the quantum correlations harnessed by an adiabatic
computation. We apply these to the D-Wave Vesuvius machine with revealing -

collisions as for instance in such observables as the $\pi^-/\pi^+$ ratio is
discussed using a simple chiral Lagrangian. It is shown, with some mild
assumptions, that kaons, when present in the system, can affect the EoS
appreciably for both symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter. For nuclear
matter with small asymmetry with which heavy-ion collisions are studied, it may
be difficult to distinguish a stiff symmetry energy and the supersoft symmetry
energy, even with kaons present. However the effect of kaon is found to be
significant such that $\mu_n-\mu_p \neq 0$ near $x=1/2$, at which the chemical
potential difference is zero without kaon amplitude. We present the argument
that in order to obtain a reliably accurate equation of state (EoS) for
compact-star matter, a much deeper understanding is needed on how the
strangeness degrees of freedom such as kaons, hyperons etc. behave in baryonic
matter in a Fermi liquid (or possibly a non-Fermi liquid) phase with potential
phase changes. It is suggested that such an {\em accurate} treatment could have
an important implication on possibly modified gravity.

singularities, then the space-time singular set is contained in finitely many
compact embedded $(n-1)$-dimensional Lipschitz submanifolds plus a set of
dimension at most $n-2$. If the initial hypersurface is mean convex, then all
singularities are generic and the results apply.
  In $R^3$ and $R^4$, we show that for almost all times the evolving
hypersurface is completely smooth and any connected component of the singular
set is entirely contained in a time-slice. For $2$ or $3$-convex hypersurfaces
in all dimensions, the same arguments lead to the same conclusion: the flow is
completely smooth at almost all times and connected components of the singular
set are contained in time-slices. A key technical point is a strong
{\emph{parabolic}} Reifenberg property that we show in all dimensions and for
all flows with only generic singularities. We also show that the entire flow
clears out very rapidly after a generic singularity.

are either sold in spot through auction mechanisms or in advance via guaranteed

bidding (RTB); however, the latter is still mainly done over the counter
through direct sales. This paper proposes a mathematical model that allocates
and prices the future impressions between real-time auctions and guaranteed
contracts. Under conventional economic assumptions, our model shows that the
two ways can be seamless combined programmatically and the publisher's revenue
can be maximized via price discrimination and optimal allocation. We consider
advertisers are risk-averse, and they would be willing to purchase guaranteed
impressions if the total costs are less than their private values. We also
consider that an advertiser's purchase behavior can be affected by both the
guaranteed price and the time interval between the purchase time and the
impression delivery date. Our solution suggests an optimal percentage of future
impressions to sell in advance and provides an explicit formula to calculate at
what prices to sell. We find that the optimal guaranteed prices are dynamic and
are non-decreasing over time. We evaluate our method with RTB datasets and find
that the model adopts different strategies in allocation and pricing according
to the level of competition. From the experiments we find that, in a less
competitive market, lower prices of the guaranteed contracts will encourage the
purchase in advance and the revenue gain is mainly contributed by the increased
competition in future RTB. In a highly competitive market, advertisers are more
willing to purchase the guaranteed contracts and thus higher prices are
expected. The revenue gain is largely contributed by the guaranteed selling.

signature at the LHC, featuring a distinctive $E^{\gamma}_T$ peak around 60

systems analysis and design. As this approach evolves, it becomes able to
provide additional information for various types of analyses. One very
important direction is the optimization of multibody systems. Sensitivity
analysis of multibody system dynamics is essential for design optimization.
Dynamic sensitivities, when needed, are often calculated by means of finite
differences. However, depending of the number of parameters involved, this
procedure can be computationally expensive. Moreover, in many cases the results
suffer from low accuracy when real perturbations are used. This paper develops
the adjoint sensitivity analysis of multibody systems in the context of penalty
formulations. The resulting sensitivities are applied to perform dynamical
optimization of a full vehicle system.

$T$*, has a distinct broken electronic symmetry from that of superconductivity.
Particularly, recent scattering experiments on the underdoped cuprates have
suggested that a charge ordering competes with superconductivity. However, no
direct link of this physics and the important low-energy excitations has been
identified. Here we report an antagonistic singularity at $T_{c}$ in the

insights into the nature of the competitive interplay between the two
intertwined phases and the complex phase diagram near the pseudogap critical

dark matter particles annihilating into Standard Model fermions with a cross

this particle has not yet been observed in direct detection experiments
somewhat restricts the nature of its interactions. One way to suppress the dark
matter's elastic scattering cross section with nuclei is to consider models in
which the dark matter is part of a hidden sector. In such models, the dark
matter can annihilate into other hidden sector particles, which then decay into
Standard Model fermions through a small degree of mixing with the photon, Z, or
Higgs bosons. After discussing the gamma-ray signal from hidden sector dark
matter in general terms, we consider two concrete realizations: a hidden photon
model in which the dark matter annihilates into a pair of vector gauge bosons
that decay through kinetic mixing with the photon, and a scenario within the
generalized NMSSM in which the dark matter is a singlino-like neutralino that
annihilates into a pair of singlet Higgs bosons, which decay through their

complexity measure is the number of calls to any of the unitary gates $U_i$ in
a quantum circuit which solves the problem. The second model provides quantum
switches and treats unitary transformations as inputs of second order. In that

Colnaghi et al. have shown that the problem can be solved within $n^2$ calls in
the query model and $\frac{n(n-1)}2$ quantum switches in the new model. We
refine these results by proving that $n\log_2(n) +\Theta(n)$ quantum switches

screening or Vainshtein mechanisms, and in inflationary models that rely on
large kinetic terms. Next, we clarify the role played by the symmetries. While
symmetries protect the form of the quantum corrections, theories equipped with
more symmetries do not necessarily have a broader range of scales for which
they are valid. We show this by deriving explicitly the regime of validity of
the classical solutions for $P(X)$ theories including Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI)

Indeed, we find that despite the existence of an additional symmetry, the DBI
effective field theory has a regime of validity similar to an arbitrary $P(X)$
theory. We explore the implications of our results for both early and late
universe contexts. Conversely, when applied to static and spherical screening
mechanisms, we deduce that the regime of validity of typical power-law $P(X)$

$\pi^0$-decay gamma-rays and secondary electrons through proton-proton
interaction. We follow the evolution of the CR protons and electrons by
calculating their distribution functions. We find that the spectrum and the
intensity profile of $\pi^0$-decay gamma-rays are consistent with observations.
We predict that the shock front is located far ahead of the gamma-ray boundary
of the Fermi bubbles. This naturally explains the fact that a clear temperature
jump of thermal gas was not discovered at the gamma-ray boundary in recent
Suzaku observations. We also consider re-acceleration of the background CRs in
the Galactic halo at the shock front. We find that it can significantly affect
the gamma-rays from the Fermi bubbles, unless the density of the background CRs
is $\lesssim 10$\% of that in the Galactic disk. We indicate that secondary
electrons alone cannot produce the observed radio emission from the Fermi
bubbles. However, the radio emission from the outermost region of the bubbles
can be explained, if electrons are directly accelerated at the shock front with

baryonic mass resolution of $1.8\times 10^2\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and a gravitational

the regime of mostly isolated dwarf galaxies with halo masses
$\sim10^{10}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ where dark matter dynamically dominates even at
sub-kpc scales. We find that while the global properties of galaxies of this
scale are minimally affected by allowed self-interactions, their internal
structures change significantly if the cross section is large enough within the
inner sub-kpc region. In these dark-matter-dominated systems, self-scattering
ties the shape of the stellar distribution to that of the dark matter
distribution. In particular, we find that the stellar core radius is closely
related to the dark matter core radius generated by self-interactions. Dark
matter collisions lead to dwarf galaxies with larger stellar cores and smaller
stellar central densities compared to the cold dark matter case. The central
metallicity within $1\,{\rm kpc}$ is also larger by up to $\sim 15\%$ in the

1<z<3 in the CANDELS UDS and COSMOS fields and have decomposed these systems
into their separate bulge and disk components according to their H(160)-band
morphologies. By extending this analysis to multiple bands we have been able to
conduct individual bulge and disk component SED fitting which has provided us
with stellar-mass and star-formation rate estimates for the separate bulge and
disk components. These have been combined with size measurements to explore the
evolution of these massive high-redshift galaxies. By utilising the new
decomposed stellar-mass estimates, we confirm that the bulge components display
a stronger size evolution than the disks. This can be seen from both the
fraction of bulge components which lie below the local relation and the median
sizes of the bulge components, where the bulges are a median factor of
2.93+/-0.32 times smaller than similarly massive local galaxies at 1<z<2 and
3.41+/-0.58 smaller at 2<z<3; for the disks the corresponding factors are
1.65+/-0.14 and 1.99+/-0.25. Moreover, by splitting our sample into the passive
and star-forming bulge and disk sub-populations and examining their sizes as a
fraction of their present-day counter-parts, we find that the star-forming and
passive bulges are equally compact, star-forming disks are larger, while the
passive disks have intermediate sizes. This trend is not evident when
classifying galaxy morphology on the basis of single-Sersic fits and adopting
the overall star-formation rates. Finally, by evolving the star-formation
histories of the passive disks back to the redshifts when the passive disks
were last active, we show that the passive and star-forming disks have
consistent sizes at the relevant epoch. These trends need to be reproduced by
any mechanisms which attempt to explain the morphological evolution of
galaxies.

Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey in order to characterize the
kinematic orientation of non-interacting galaxies. The study of galaxies in
isolation is a key step towards understanding how fast-external processes, such
as major mergers, affect kinematic properties in galaxies. We derived the
global and individual (projected approaching and receding sides) kinematic
position angles (PAs) for both the stellar and ionised gas line-of-sight
velocity distributions. When compared to the photometric PA, we find that
morpho-kinematic differences are smaller than 22 degrees in 90% of the sample
for both components; internal kinematic misalignments are generally smaller
than 16 degrees. We find a tight relation between the global stellar and
ionised gas kinematic PA consistent with circular-flow pattern motions in both
components. This relation also holds generally in barred galaxies across the
bar and galaxy disk scales. Our findings suggest that even in the presence of
strong bars, both the stellar and the gaseous components tend to follow the
gravitational potential of the disk. As a result, kinematic orientation can be
used to assess the degree of external distortions in interacting galaxies.

is a warm Jupiter at semi-major axis a = 0.370 +0.007/-0.006 AU with a large
eccentricity e=0.85 +0.08/-0.07 measured via the ""photoeccentric effect."" It
exhibits transit timing variations induced by the non-transiting Kepler-419c,
which we uniquely constrain to be a moderately eccentric (e=0.184 +/- 0.002),
hierarchically-separated (a=1.68 +/- 0.03 AU) giant planet (7.3 +/- 0.4 MJup).
We combine sixteen quarters of Kepler photometry, radial-velocity (RV)
measurements from the HIgh Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) on Keck, and
improved stellar parameters that we derive from spectroscopy and
asteroseismology. From the RVs, we measure the mass of inner planet to be
2.5+/-0.3MJup and confirm its photometrically-measured eccentricity, refining
the value to e=0.83+/-0.01. The RV acceleration is consistent with the
properties of the outer planet derived from TTVs. We find that, despite their
sizable eccentricities, the planets are coplanar to within 9 +8/-6 degrees, and
therefore the inner planet's large eccentricity and close-in orbit are unlikely
to be the result of Kozai migration. Moreover, even over many secular cycles,
the inner planet's periapse is most likely never small enough for tidal
circularization. Finally, we present and measure a transit time and impact
parameter from four simultaneous ground-based light curves from 1m-class
telescopes, demonstrating the feasibility of ground-based follow-up of Kepler
giant planets exhibiting large TTVs.

pinnacles"", integer approximations of a harmonic variational problem. Second,
in this model conditioned on $\eta\geq 0$ (a floor), the average height rises,
and in fact the height of almost all sites concentrates on levels $H,H+1$ where
$H\sim M/\sqrt{2}$.
  This in particular pins down the asymptotics, and corrects the order, in
results of Bricmont, El-Mellouki and Fr\""ohlich (1986), where it was argued
that the maximum and the height of the surface above a floor are both of order
$\sqrt{\log L}$.
  Finally, our methods extend to other classical surface models (e.g.,
restricted SOS), featuring connections to $p$-harmonic analysis and alternating
sign matrices.

ferromagnetism in a strongly interacting Fermi gas at zero temperature in the
absence of molecule formation. The interaction energy is obtained by summing
the perturbative contributions of Galitskii-Feynman type to all orders in the
gas parameter. It can be expressed by a simple phase space integral of an
in-medium scattering phase shift. In both three and two dimensions (3D and 2D),
the interaction energy shows a maximum before reaching the resonance from the
Bose-Einstein condensate side, which provides a possible explanation of the
experimental measurements of the interaction energy. This phenomenon can be
theoretically explained by the qualitative change of the nature of the binary
interaction in the medium. The appearance of an energy maximum has significant
effects on the itinerant ferromagnetism. In 3D, the ferromagnetic transition is
reentrant and itinerant ferromagnetism exists in a narrow window around the
energy maximum. In 2D, the present theoretical approach suggests that itinerant
ferromagnetism does not exist, which reflects the fact that the energy maximum
becomes much lower than the energy of the fully polarized state.

semi-implicit time discretization method and with a spatial discretization
based on adaptive discontinuous finite elements. The resulting method has full
second order accuracy in time and can employ polynomial bases of arbitrarily
high degree in space, is unconditionally stable and can effectively adapt the
number of degrees of freedom employed in each element, in order to balance
accuracy and computational cost. The p-adaptivity approach employed does not
require remeshing, therefore it is especially suitable for applications, such
as numerical weather prediction, in which a large number of physical quantities
are associated with a given mesh. Furthermore, although the proposed method can
be implemented on arbitrary unstructured and nonconforming meshes, even its
application on simple Cartesian meshes in spherical coordinates can cure
effectively the pole problem by reducing the polynomial degree used in the
polar elements. Numerical simulations of classical benchmarks for the shallow
water and for the fully compressible Euler equations validate the method and
demonstrate its capability to achieve accurate results also at large Courant
numbers, with time steps up to 100 times larger than those of typical explicit
discretizations of the same problems, while reducing the computational cost
thanks to the adaptivity algorithm.

nucleotide variation (SNV) in next generation sequencing data. For instance,
errors may be introduced during library construction and sequencing steps. In
addition, the reference genome and the algorithms used for the alignment of the
reads are further critical factors determining the efficacy of variant calling
methods. It is crucial to account for these factors in individual sequencing
experiments.
  Results: We introduce a simple data-adaptive model for variant calling. This
model automatically adjusts to specific factors such as alignment errors. To
achieve this, several characteristics are sampled from sites with low mismatch
rates, and these are used to estimate empirical log-likelihoods. These
likelihoods are then combined to a score that typically gives rise to a mixture
distribution. From these we determine a decision threshold to separate
potentially variant sites from the noisy background.
  Conclusions: In simulations we show that our simple proposed model is
competitive with frequently used much more complex SNV calling algorithms in
terms of sensitivity and specificity. It performs specifically well in cases
with low allele frequencies. The application to next-generation sequencing data
reveals stark differences of the score distributions indicating a strong
influence of data specific sources of noise. The proposed model is specifically
designed to adjust to these differences.

smallest currently observable flare events in X-rays, possess the same
energetic properties as large flares. Recent surveys have suggested that
microflares may be less efficient particle accelerators than large flares, and
hence contribute less nonthermal energy, which may have implications for
coronal heating mechanisms. We therefore explore the energetic properties of
microflares by combining Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray measurements.
  We present forward-fitting differential emission measure (DEM) analysis of 10
microflares. The fitting is constrained by combining, for the first time, high
temperature RHESSI observations and flux data from SDO/AIA. Two fitting models
are tested for the DEM; a Gaussian distribution and a uniform DEM profile. A
Gaussian fit proved unable to explain the observations for any of the studied
microflares. However, 8 of 10 events studied were reasonably fit by a uniform
DEM profile. Hence microflare plasma can be considered to be significantly
multi-thermal, and may not be significantly peaked or contain resolvable fine
structure, within the uncertainties of the observational instruments.
  The thermal and non-thermal energy is estimated for each microflare,
comparing the energy budget with an isothermal plasma assumption. From the
multithermal fits the minimum non-thermal energy content was found to average
approximately 30% of the estimated thermal energy. By comparison, under an
isothermal model the non-thermal and thermal energy estimates were generally
comparable. Hence, multi-thermal plasma is an important consideration for solar
microflares that substantially alters their thermal and non-thermal energy
content.

Tupper and Yang (2012), we proposed a framework for such systems in which,
instead of a diffusion coefficient and a drift coefficient, a modeller
specifies a diffusion coefficient and a equilibrium density, and then assumes
detailed balance with respect to this equilibrium density. We proposed a
numerical method for such systems that works directly with the diffusion
coefficient and equilibrium density, rather than the drift coefficient, and
uses a Metropolis-Hastings rejection process to preserve the equilibrium
density exactly. Here we show that the method is weakly convergent with order
1/2 for such systems with smooth coefficients. We perform numerical experiments
demonstrating the convergence of the method for systems not covered by our
theorem, including systems with discontinuous diffusion coefficients and
equilibrium densities.

resulting from a large-scale AIMD simulation of (H$_2$O)$_{128}$ at the
PBE0+vdW level of theory, significantly softens the structure of ambient liquid
water and yields an oxygen-oxygen structure factor, $S_{\rm OO}(Q)$, and
corresponding oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function, $g_{\rm OO}(r)$, that
are now in quantitative agreement with the best available experimental data.
This level of agreement between simulation and experiment as demonstrated
herein originates from an increase in the relative population of water
molecules in the interstitial region between the first and second coordination
shells, a collective reorganization in the liquid phase which is facilitated by
a weakening of the hydrogen bond strength by the use of the PBE0 hybrid XC
functional, coupled with a relative stabilization of the resultant disordered
liquid water configurations by the inclusion of non-local vdW/dispersion

overproduce stars by a factor of ~2 with respect to the predictions provided by
abundance matching methods for halos more massive than 5E11 Msun/h (Behroozi,
Wechsler & Conroy 2013).
  We also study the morphological impact of radiation pressure on our
simulations. In simulations with RP the average number of low mass clumps falls
dramatically. Only clumps with stellar masses Mclump/Mdisk <= 5% are impacted
by the inclusion of RP, and RP and no-RP clump counts above this range are
comparable. The inclusion of RP depresses the contrast ratios of clumps by
factors of a few for clump masses less than 5% of the disk masses. For more
massive clumps, the differences between and RP and no-RP simulations diminish.
We note however, that the simulations analyzed have disk stellar masses below
about 2E10 Msun/h.
  By creating mock Hubble Space Telescope observations we find that the number
of clumps is slightly reduced in simulations with RP. However, since massive
clumps survive the inclusion of RP and are found in our mock observations, we
do not find a disagreement between simulations of our clumpy galaxies and
observations of clumpy galaxies. We demonstrate that clumps found in any single

most $d$ are zero, i.e., $f$ is uncorrelated with all low-degree parities. We
study the notion of $\mathit{approximate}$ $\mathit{resilience}$ of Boolean
functions, where we say that $f$ is $\alpha$-approximately $d$-resilient if $f$
is $\alpha$-close to a $[-1,1]$-valued $d$-resilient function in $\ell_1$
distance. We show that approximate resilience essentially characterizes the
complexity of agnostic learning of a concept class $C$ over the uniform
distribution. Roughly speaking, if all functions in a class $C$ are far from
being $d$-resilient then $C$ can be learned agnostically in time $n^{O(d)}$ and
conversely, if $C$ contains a function close to being $d$-resilient then
agnostic learning of $C$ in the statistical query (SQ) framework of Kearns has
complexity of at least $n^{\Omega(d)}$. This characterization is based on the
duality between $\ell_1$ approximation by degree-$d$ polynomials and
approximate $d$-resilience that we establish. In particular, it implies that
$\ell_1$ approximation by low-degree polynomials, known to be sufficient for
agnostic learning over product distributions, is in fact necessary.
  Focusing on monotone Boolean functions, we exhibit the existence of
near-optimal $\alpha$-approximately
$\widetilde{\Omega}(\alpha\sqrt{n})$-resilient monotone functions for all
$\alpha>0$. Prior to our work, it was conceivable even that every monotone
function is $\Omega(1)$-far from any $1$-resilient function. Furthermore, we
construct simple, explicit monotone functions based on ${\sf Tribes}$ and ${\sf
CycleRun}$ that are close to highly resilient functions. Our constructions are
based on a fairly general resilience analysis and amplification. These
structural results, together with the characterization, imply nearly optimal
lower bounds for agnostic learning of monotone juntas.

mechanical objects can offer a route towards a purely mechanical entanglement
and the unique possibility of probing the quantum mechanical nature of our
everyday classical world. In spite of this prospect, mechanical two-mode
squeezed states have remained elusive due to the inability to recreate the
nonlinear interaction at the heart of this phenomenon in the mechanical domain.
To address this we have developed a parametric down-converter, in a mechanical
resonator integrated with electrical functionality, which enables mechanical
nonlinearities to be dynamically engineered to emulate the parametric
down-conversion interaction. In this configuration, phonons are simultaneously
generated in pairs in two macroscopic vibration modes which results in the
amplification of their motion. In parallel, mechanical two-mode squeezed states
are also created which exhibit fluctuations far below the thermal level of
their constituent modes as well as harbouring correlations between the modes
that become almost perfect as their amplification is increased. This remarkable
observation of correlations between two massive phonon ensembles paves the way
towards an entangled macroscopic mechanical system at the single phonon level.

that can measure the acoustic properties of fluids and bioanalytes in a
fully-contained microfluidic system. By confining light in ultra-high-Q
whispering gallery modes of OMFRs, optical forces such as radiation pressure
and electrostriction can be used to actuate and sense structural mechanical
vibrations spanning MHz to GHz frequencies. These vibrations are hybrid
fluid-shell modes that entrain any bioanalyte present inside. As a result,
bioanalytes can now reflect their acoustic properties on the optomechanical
vibrational spectrum of the device, in addition to optical property
measurements with existing optofluidics techniques. In this work, we
investigate acoustic sensing capabilities of OMFRs using computational
eigenfrequency analysis. We analyze the OMFR eigenfrequency sensitivity to bulk
fluid-phase materials as well as nanoparticles, and propose methods to extract
multiple acoustic parameters from multiple vibrational modes. The new
informational degrees-of-freedom provided by such opto-acoustic measurements

SMC method for pricing barrier options with continuous and discrete monitoring
of the barrier condition. Under the SMC method, simulated asset values rejected
due to barrier condition are re-sampled from asset samples that do not breach
the barrier condition improving the efficiency of the option price estimator;
while under the standard Monte Carlo many simulated asset paths can be rejected
by the barrier condition making it harder to estimate option price accurately.
We compare SMC with the standard Monte Carlo method and demonstrate that the
extra effort to implement SMC when compared with the standard Monte Carlo is
very little while improvement in price estimate can be significant. Both
methods result in unbiased estimators for the price converging to the true
value as $1/\sqrt{M}$, where $M$ is the number of simulations (asset paths).
However, the variance of SMC estimator is smaller and does not grow with the
number of time steps when compared to the standard Monte Carlo. In this paper
we demonstrate that SMC can successfully be used for pricing barrier options.
SMC can also be used for pricing other exotic options and also for cases with
many underlying assets and additional stochastic factors such as stochastic
volatility; we provide general formulas and references.

Methods. The Random Forest algorithm constructs the catalog from RCS-2 point
sources using SDSS spectroscopically-confirmed stars and quasars. The algorithm
identifies putative quasars from broadband magnitudes (g, r, i, z) and colours.
Exploiting NUV GALEX measurements for a subset of the objects, we refine the

WISE W1 and W2 bands is also studied. Results. Upon analyzing 542,897 RCS-2
point sources, the algorithm identified 21,501 quasar candidates, with a
training-set-derived precision (the fraction of true positives within the group
assigned quasar status) of 89.5% and recall (the fraction of true positives
relative to all sources that actually are quasars) of 88.4%. These performance
metrics improve for the GALEX subset; 6,530 quasar candidates are identified

systematically-improved, and error-controlled approach to construct accurate
analytical approximate solutions of mode functions of perturbations of the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe, designed especially for the cases where
the relativistic linear dispersion relation is modified after gravitational
quantum effects are taken into account. These include models from
string/M-Theory, loop quantum cosmology and Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz quantum
gravity. In this paper, we extend our previous studies of the first-order
approximations to high orders for the cases where the modified dispersion
relation (linear or nonlinear) has only one-turning point (or zero). We obtain
the general expressions for the power spectra and spectral indices of both
scalar and tensor perturbations up to the third-order, at which the error
bounds are $\lesssim 0.15\%$. As an application of these formulas, we calculate
the power spectra and spectral indices in the slow-roll inflation with a
nonlinear power-law dispersion relation. To check the consistency of our
formulas, we further restrict ourselves to the relativistic case, and calculate
the corresponding power spectra, spectral indices and runnings to the
second-order. Then, we compare our results with the ones obtained by the Green
function method, and show explicitly that the results obtained by these two
different methods are consistent within the allowed errors.

to the contradiction between dynamic user data traffic and static data plans.
To address this important but largely unexplored issue, in this paper, we
design a new data plan sharing system named Prometheus, which is based on the
scenario that some smartphone users have surplus data traffic and are willing
to help others download data. To realize this system, we first propose a
mechanism that incorporates LT codes into UDP. It is robust to transmission
errors and encourages more concurrent transmissions and forwardings. It also
can be implemented easily with low implementation complexity. Then we design an
incentive mechanism using a Stackelberg game to choose assistant users ($AUs$),
all participants will gain credits in return, which can be used to ask for
future help when they need to download something. Finally real environment
experiments are conducted and the results show that users in our Prometheus not
only can manage their surplus data plan more efficiently, but also achieve a
higher speed download rate.

for remotely preparing a general pure state with a pure entangled state and

systems it is possible to use a coding of the target state to optimize the
classical communication cost. Unfortunately, for low-dimensional systems such

central role in quantum information theory, we propose an optimization

of HTS tapes require the knowledge of the Jc(B,theta) dependence, i.e. of the
way the critical current density Jc depends on the magnetic flux density B and
its orientation theta with respect to the tape. In this paper we present a
numerical model based on the critical state with angular field dependence of Jc
to extract the Jc(B,theta) relation from experimental data. The model takes
into account the self-field created by the tape, which gives an important
contribution when the field applied in the experiments is low. The same model
can also be used to compute the effective critical current of devices composed
of electromagnetically interacting tapes. Three examples are considered here:
two differently current rated Roebel cables composed of REBCO coated conductors
and a power cable prototype composed of Bi-2223 tapes. The critical currents
computed with the numerical model show good agreement with the measured ones.
The simulations reveal also that several parameter sets in the Jc(B,theta) give
an equally good representation of the experimental characterization of the
tapes and that the measured Ic values of cables are subjected to the influence
of experimental conditions, such as Ic degradation due to the manufacturing and
assembling process and non-uniformity of the tape properties. These two aspects
make the determination of a very precise Jc(B,theta) expression probably
unnecessary, as long as that expression is able to reproduce the main features
of the angular dependence. The easiness of use of this model, which can be
straightforwardly implemented in finite-element programs able to solve static
electromagnetic problems, is very attractive both for researchers and devices
manufactures who want to characterize superconducting tapes and calculate the
effective critical current of superconducting devices.

$\nu$ is any finite complex Borel measure; creation/annihilation operators may
be also replaced by $B^k_t$ with $\check{B^k_t}(p)=|p|^k\check{B}(p)$. We also
use the notion of energy-momentum scaling degree of $B$ with respect to a
submanifold (Steinmann-type, but in momentum space, and applied to the norm of
an operator). These two tools are applied to the analysis of singularities of
$\check{B}(p)G(P^0)$. We prove, among others, the following statement (modulo
some more specific assumptions): outside $p=0$ the only allowed contributions
to this functional which are concentrated on a submanifold (including the
trivial one -- a single point) are Dirac measures on hypersurfaces (if the
decay of $D$ is not to slow).

an evolutionary model for the origin of And II involving a merger between two
disky dwarf galaxies whose structural parameters differ only in their disk
scale lengths. The dwarfs are placed on a radial orbit towards each other with
their angular momenta inclined by 45 deg to the orbital plane and by 90 deg
with respect to each other. After 5 Gyr of evolution the merger remnant forms a
stable triaxial galaxy with rotation only around the longest axis. The origin
of this rotation is naturally explained as due to the symmetry of the initial
configuration which leads to the conservation of angular momentum components
along the direction of the merger. The stars originating from the two dwarfs
show significantly different surface density profiles while having very similar
kinematics in agreement with the properties of separate stellar populations in
And II. We also study an alternative scenario for the formation of And II, via
tidal stirring of a disky dwarf galaxy. While intrinsic rotation occurs
naturally in this model as a remnant of the initial rotation of the disk, it is
mostly around the shortest axis of the stellar component. The rotation around
the longest axis is induced only occasionally and remains much smaller that the
system's velocity dispersion. We conclude that although tidal origin of the
velocity distribution in And II cannot be excluded, it is much more naturally
explained within the scenario involving a past merger event. Thus, in
principle, the presence of prolate rotation in dSph galaxies of the Local Group
and beyond may be used as an indicator of major mergers in their history or
even as a way to distinguish between the two scenarios of their formation.

expression for the mean squared error in the reconstruction of the process from
a noisy and information rate-limited version of its samples. This expression is
a function of the sampling frequency and the average number of bits describing
each sample. It is given as the sum of two terms: Minimum mean square error in
estimating the source from its noisy but otherwise fully observed sub-Nyquist
samples, and a second term obtained by reverse waterfilling over an average of
spectral densities associated with the polyphase components of the source. We
extend this result to multi-branch uniform sampling, where the samples are
available through a set of parallel channels with a uniform sampler and a
pre-sampling filter in each branch. Further optimization to reduce distortion
is then performed over the pre-sampling filters, and an optimal set of
pre-sampling filters associated with the statistics of the input signal and the
sampling frequency is found. This results in an expression for the minimal
possible distortion achievable under any analog to digital conversion scheme

considered in an ``infrastructure'' setting, where all users receive a common
multicast (coded) message from a single omniscient server (e.g., a base station
having all the files in the library) through a shared bottleneck link. In this
work, we consider a D2D ``infrastructure-less'' version of the problem. We
propose a caching strategy based on deterministic assignment of subpackets of
the library files, and a coded delivery strategy where the users send linearly
coded messages to each other in order to collectively satisfy their demands. We
also consider a random caching strategy, which is more suitable to a fully
decentralized implementation. Under certain conditions, both approaches can
achieve the information theoretic outer bound within a constant multiplicative
factor. In our previous work, we showed that a caching D2D wireless network
with one-hop communication, random caching, and uncoded delivery, achieves the
same throughput scaling law of the infrastructure-based coded multicasting
scheme, in the regime of large number of users and files in the library. This
shows that the spatial reuse gain of the D2D network is order-equivalent to the
coded multicasting gain of single base station transmission. It is therefore
natural to ask whether these two gains are cumulative, i.e.,if a D2D network
with both local communication (spatial reuse) and coded multicasting can
provide an improved scaling law. Somewhat counterintuitively, we show that
these gains do not cumulate (in terms of throughput scaling law).

synthetic aperture radar (SAR), electroencephalogram (EEG) data analysis or
color image restoration in HSV or LCh spaces the data has its range on the
one-dimensional sphere $\mathbb S^1$. Although the minimization of total
variation (TV) regularized functionals is among the most popular methods for
edge-preserving image restoration such methods were only very recently applied
to cyclic structures. However, as for Euclidean data, TV regularized
variational methods suffer from the so called staircasing effect. This effect
can be avoided by involving higher order derivatives into the functional.
  This is the first paper which uses higher order differences of cyclic data in
regularization terms of energy functionals for image restoration. We introduce
absolute higher order differences for $\mathbb S^1$-valued data in a sound way
which is independent of the chosen representation system on the circle. Our
absolute cyclic first order difference is just the geodesic distance between
points. Similar to the geodesic distances the absolute cyclic second order
differences have only values in [0,{\pi}]. We update the cyclic variational TV
approach by our new cyclic second order differences. To minimize the
corresponding functional we apply a cyclic proximal point method which was
recently successfully proposed for Hadamard manifolds. Choosing appropriate
cycles this algorithm can be implemented in an efficient way. The main steps
require the evaluation of proximal mappings of our cyclic differences for which
we provide analytical expressions. Under certain conditions we prove the
convergence of our algorithm. Various numerical examples with artificial as
well as real-world data demonstrate the advantageous performance of our
algorithm.

any quantum state tomography scheme - including the widely used maximum

are consistent estimators. Schwemmer et al. (arXiv:1310.8465 [quant-ph])
illustrate this by observing a systematic underestimation of the fidelity and
an overestimation of entanglement in estimators obtained from simulated data.
Further, these authors argue that the simple method of linear inversion
overcomes this (perceived) problem of bias, and there is the suggestion to
abandon time-tested estimation procedures in favor of linear inversion. Here,
we discuss the pros and cons of using biased and unbiased estimators for
quantum state tomography. We conclude that the little occasional benefit from
the unbiased linear-inversion estimation does not justify the high price of
using unphysical estimators, which are typically the case in that scheme.

confirmation. We report a confident detection of a transit color signature that
can only be explained by a compact occulting body, entirely ruling out a
contaminating eclipsing binary, a hierarchical triple, or a grazing eclipsing
binary. Those findings are corroborated by our radial velocity measurements,
which put an upper limit of ~1 Mjup on the mass of Kepler-418b. We also report
that the host star is significantly blended, confirming the ~10% light
contamination suspected from the crowding metric in the Kepler light curve
measured by the Kepler team. We report detection of an unresolved light source
that contributes an additional ~40% to the target star, which would not have
been detected without multicolor photometric analysis. The resulting
planet-star radius ratio is 0.110 +/- 0.0025, more than 25% more than the 0.087

demonstrating that this technique is viable from ground for giant planets. It
is particularly useful for planets with long periods such as Kepler-418b, which
tend to have long transit durations. Additionally, multicolor photometric
analysis of transits can reveal unknown stellar neighbors and binary companions
that do not affect the classification of the transiting object but can have a

deliver better performance than traditional TCP Reno, they have not yet been
widely incorporated to the Internet. Several factors have contributed to their
lack of deployment. Probably, the main contributing factor is that they are not
able to compete fairly against loss-based congestion control protocols. In
fact, the transmission rate in equilibrium of delay-based approaches is always
less than their fair share when they share the network with traditional
TCP-Reno derivatives, that employ packet losses as their congestion signal.
There are also other performance impairments caused by the sensitivity to
errors in the measurement of the congestion signal (queuing delay) that reduce
the efficiency and the intra-protocol fairness of the algorithms. In this paper
we report, analyze and discuss some recent proposals in the literature to
improve the dynamic behavior of delay-based congestion control algorithms, and

concept) from the TD configuration-interaction singles (TDCIS) method, the
TD-RASSCF-S method can be regarded as a hybrid of them. We prove that, for
closed-shell $N_{\rm e}$-electron systems, the TD-RASSCF-S wave function can be
fully converged using only $N_{\rm e}/2+1\le M\le N_{\rm e}$ spatial orbitals.
Importantly, based on the TD variational principle, the converged TD-RASSCF-S
wave function with $M= N_{\rm e}$ is more accurate than the TDCIS wave
function. The accuracy of the TD-RASSCF-S approach over the TDCIS is
illustrated by the calculation of high-order harmonic generation spectra for
one-dimensional models of atomic helium, beryllium, and carbon in an intense
laser pulse. The electronic dynamics during the process is investigated by
analyzing the behavior of electron density and orbitals. The TD-RASSCF-S method
is accurate, numerically tractable, and applicable for large systems beyond the
capability of the MCTDHF method.

their evolution, a young F-type star, and a classical pulsator in the
instability strip. The spectra obtained after filling the gaps in the selected
solar-like stars show a net reduction in the overall background level, as well
as a change in the background parameters. The inferred convective properties
could change as much as 200% in the selected example, introducing a bias in the
p-mode frequency of maximum power. When global asteroseismic scaling relations
are used, this bias can lead up to a variation in the surface gravity of 0.05

Nakanishi, who also described the corresponding Y-systems, and T-systems with
coefficients.
  A result of Fomin and Zelevinsky says that the coefficient-free T-system
provides a solution of the Y-system. In this paper, we show that in general
there is a discrepancy between these two systems, in the sense that the
solution of the former does not correspond to the general solution of the
latter. This discrepancy is removed by introducing additional non-autonomous
coefficients into the T-system. In particular, we focus on the period 1 case
and show that, when the exchange matrix B is degenerate, discrete Painlev\'e
equations can arise from this construction.

method is formulated based on the TD variational principle. In analogy with the
configuration-interaction singles (CIS), singles-and-doubles (CISD),
singles-doubles-and-triples (CISDT) methods in quantum chemistry, the
TD-RASSCF-S, -SD, and -SDT methods are introduced as extensions of the
TD-RASSCF dou- bles (-D) method [Phys. Rev. A 87, 062511 (2013)]. Based on an
analysis of the numerical cost and test calculations for one-dimensional (1D)
models of atomic helium, beryllium, and carbon, it is shown that the
TD-RASSCF-S and -D methods are computationally feasible for systems with many
electrons and more accurate than the TD Hartree-Fock (TDHF) and TDCIS methods.
In addition to the discussion of methodology, an analysis of electron dynamics
in the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) process is presented. For the 1D
beryllium atom, a state-resolved analysis of the HHG spectrum based on the
time-independent HF orbitals shows that while only single-orbital excitations
are needed in the region below the cutoff, single- and double-orbital
excitations are es- sential beyond, where accordingly the
single-active-electron (SAE) approximation and the TDCIS method break down. On
the other hand, the TD-RASSCF-S and -D methods accurately describe the
multi-orbital excitation processes throughout the entire region of the HHG
spectrum. For the 1D carbon atom, our calculations show that multi-orbital
excitations are essential in the HHG process even below the cutoff. Hence, in
this test system a very accurate treatment of electron correlation is required.
The TD-RASSCF-S and -D approaches meet this demand, while the SAE approximation
and the TDCIS method are inadequate.

to emission from a family of UV heated nanometer-sized carbonaceous molecules
known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), causing them to be referred
to as aromatic IR bands (AIBs). Today, the acceptance of the PAH model is far
from settled, as the identification of a single PAH in space has not yet been
successful and physically relevant theoretical models involving ``true'' PAH
cross sections do not reproduce the AIBs in detail. In this paper, we use the
NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database, which contains over 500
quantum-computed spectra, in conjunction with a simple emission model, to show
that the spectrum produced by any random mixture of at least 30 PAHs converges
to the same 'kernel'-spectrum. This kernel-spectrum captures the essence of the
PAH emission spectrum and is highly correlated with observations of AIBs,
strongly supporting PAHs as their source. Also, the fact that a large number of
molecules are required implies that spectroscopic signatures of the individual
PAHs contributing to the AIBs spanning the visible, near-infrared, and far
infrared spectral regions are weak, explaining why they have not yet been
detected. An improved effort, joining laboratory, theoretical, and
observational studies of the PAH emission process, will support the use of PAH
features as a probe of physical and chemical conditions in the nearby and
distant Universe.

radiation dose were both used for measurements. The decay and dose-response
curves (DRC) were plotted for different doses. The doses received by different
blood aliquots have been determined by interpolating the natural luminescence
counts to DRC. In addition, OSL counts from a healthy blood sample exposed to
an external radiation source were measured. The blood aliquots were given
different 0-200Gy beta doses and their decay and dose-response curves were
plotted. The internal dose received by the blood aliquots injected with
radioisotope was determined by interpolating the natural luminescence counts to
DRC. The internal dose values were found as 0.46Gy and 0.51Gy for different
dose range. The blood aliquots were exposed to different external laboratory
doses. The internal dose values corresponding to 10Gy laboratory dose from the
aliquots exposed to external radiation were found as 10.94Gy for Disc3 and
~10.79Gy for Disc1.This study shows that the dose received by a person can be

spectral energy distribution (SED) of IOK-1, including our ALMA limit, with
those of several types of local galaxies (including the effects of the cosmic
microwave background, CMB, on the FIR continuum) suggests that IOK-1 is similar
to local dwarf/irregular galaxies in SED shape rather than highly
dusty/obscured galaxies. Moreover, our 3 sigma FIR continuum limit, corrected
for CMB effects, implies intrinsic dust mass M_dust < 6.4 x 10^7 M_sun, FIR
luminosity L_FIR < 3.7 x 10^{10} L_sun (42.5 - 122.5 micron), total IR
luminosity L_IR < 5.7 x 10^{10} L_sun (8 - 1000 micron) and dust-obscured star
formation rate (SFR) < 10 M_sun/yr, if we assume that IOK-1 has a dust
temperature and emissivity index typical of local dwarf galaxies. This SFR is
2.4 times lower than one estimated from the UV continuum, suggesting that < 29%
of the star formation is obscured by dust. Meanwhile, our 3 sigma [CII] flux
limit translates into [CII] luminosity, L_[CII] < 3.4 x 10^7 L_sun. Locations
of IOK-1 and previously observed LAEs on the L_[CII] vs. SFR and L_[CII]/L_FIR

from the viewpoints of Dirac structures as well as Lagrangian submanifolds.
Namely, we clarify that Lagrangian submanifold theory cannot represent
nonholonomic mechanics properly, but vakonomic mechanics instead. Second, in
order to represent vakonomic mechanics, we employ the space $TQ\times
V^{\ast}$, where a vakonomic Lagrangian is defined from a given Lagrangian
(possibly degenerate) subject to nonholonomic constraints. Then, we show how
implicit vakonomic Euler-Lagrange equations can be formulated by the
Hamilton-Pontryagin variational principle for the vakonomic Lagrangian on the
extended Pontryagin bundle $(TQ\oplus T^{\ast}Q)\times V^{\ast}$. Associated
with this variational principle, we establish a Dirac structure on $(TQ\oplus

exactly one boson per site and is the ground state of a system with infinitely
strong repulsive interactions at unit filling. Using exact diagonalization and
the density matrix renormalization group method, we compute the time dependence
of such observables as the multiple occupancy and the momentum distribution
function. Typically, the relaxation to stationary values occurs over just a few
tunneling times. The stationary values are identical to the so-called diagonal
ensemble on the system sizes accessible to our numerical methods and we further
observe that the micro-canonical ensemble describes the steady state of many
observables reasonably well for small and intermediate interaction strength.
The expectation values of observables in the canonical ensemble agree
quantitatively with the time averages obtained from the quench at small
interaction strengths, and qualitatively provide a good description of
steady-state values even in parameter regimes where the micro-canonical
ensemble is not applicable due to finite-size effects. We discuss our numerical
results in the framework of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Moreover,

the computer vision community over the last few years devoting a tremendous
amount of research seeking for an optimal detector. This article presents an
algorithm for the automatic detection of circular shapes from complicated and
noisy images with no consideration of conventional Hough transform principles.
The proposed algorithm is based on Learning Automata (LA) which is a
probabilistic optimization method that explores an unknown random environment
by progressively improving the performance via a reinforcement signal
(objective function). The approach uses the encoding of three non-collinear
points as a candidate circle over the edge image. A reinforcement signal
(matching function) indicates if such candidate circles are actually present in
the edge map. Guided by the values of such reinforcement signal, the
probability set of the encoded candidate circles is modified through the LA
algorithm so that they can fit to the actual circles on the edge map.
Experimental results over several complex synthetic and natural images have
validated the efficiency of the proposed technique regarding accuracy, speed
and robustness.

compacities around 10 vol. %, indicating that the construction algorithm for
aggregates is realistic. Our results on structure are rationalized in terms of
the critical collision time between nanoparticles due to diffusion in viscous

network, with a smaller and lighter mesh in the presence of high mass polymers.
The linear rheology is investigated with oscillatory shear experiments. It
shows a feature related to the silica structure at low frequencies, the

inherently suitable for modelling corner properties by means of a rule-based

spatial distribution of the star formation in nearby galaxies free from the
limitations associated to either UV (dust attenuation) or narrow-band H$\alpha$
imaging (underlying H$\beta$ absorption). These are limitations that have
prevented (until now) carrying out a detailed study of the evolution of the SFR
by components (nuclei, bulges, disks), even locally. This kind of studies are
key, for example, for understanding how galaxies really evolve from the Blue
Cloud to the Red Sequence. We will first discuss in detail the validity of the
assumption that the SFR given by the extincion-corrected H$\alpha$ is a good
measure of the total SFR by means of cross-comparing this with other SFR
estimators, namely the integrated UV+22$\mu$m, UV+TIR,
H$\alpha_{\rm{obs}}$+22$\mu$m, or H$\alpha_{\rm{obs}}$+TIR. Only once these
effects are properly accounted for we can obtain preliminary results from the
spatially-resolved analysis of the contribution of disks to the total SFR in
the Local Universe, as a local benchmark for future studies of disks at high
redshift. Our analysis shows that at least in the Local Universe the H$\alpha$
luminosity derived from observations of the CALIFA IFS survey can be used to
trace the SFR and that the disk to total (disk + bulge) SFR ratio is on average
$\sim$88 $\%$.

the vertex set of the Hamming graph $\Gamma=H(m,q)$. A code for which there

code and on its set of neighbours is said to be neighbour transitive, and were
introduced by the authors as a group theoretic analogue to the assumption that
single errors are equally likely over a noisy channel. Examples of neighbour
transitive codes include the Hamming codes, various Golay codes, certain
Hadamard codes, the Nordstrom Robinson codes, certain permutation codes and
frequency permutation arrays, which have connections with powerline
communication, and also completely transitive codes, a subfamily of completely
regular codes, which themselves have attracted a lot of interest. It is known
that for any neighbour transitive code with minimum distance at least 3 there
exists a subgroup of $X$ that has a $2$-transitive action on the alphabet over
which the code is defined. Therefore, by Burnside's theorem, this action is of
almost simple or affine type. If the action is of almost simple type, we say
the code is alphabet almost simple neighbour transitive. In this paper we
characterise a family of neighbour transitive codes, in particular, the
alphabet almost simple neighbour transitive codes with minimum distance at
least $3$, and for which the group $X$ has a non-trivial intersection with the
base group of $Aut(\Gamma)$. If $C$ is such a code, we show that, up to
equivalence, there exists a subcode $\Delta$ that can be completely described,

exponentially at short range and algebraically at long range ($\alpha > 1$) or
purely algebraically ($\alpha < 1$). Most interestingly, along the critical
lines, long-range pairing is found to break conformal symmetry for sufficiently
small $\alpha$. This is accompanied by a violation of the area law for the
entanglement entropy in large parts of the phase diagram in the presence of a
gap, and can be detected via the dynamics of entanglement following a quench.
Some of these features may be relevant for current experiments with cold atomic
ions.

of a project aimed at investigating how such techniques can be extended to
coordinate teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic environments.
Specifically challenging are real-world environments where UAVs and other
network-enabled devices must communicate to coordinate -- and communication
actions are neither reliable nor free. Such network-centric environments are
common in military, public safety and commercial applications, yet most
research (even multi-agent planning) usually takes communications among
distributed agents as a given. We address this challenge by developing an agent
architecture and reasoning algorithms based on Answer Set Programming (ASP).
Although ASP has been used successfully in a number of applications, to the
best of our knowledge this is the first practical application of a complete
ASP-based agent architecture. It is also the first practical application of ASP
involving a combination of centralized reasoning, decentralized reasoning,
execution monitoring, and reasoning about network communications.

measure a physical quantity with extraordinary sensitivity or precision. Most
metrology schemes measure a single parameter of a dynamical process by probing
it with a specially designed quantum state. The success of such a scheme
usually relies on the process belonging to a particular one-parameter family.
If this assumption is violated, or if the goal is to measure more than one
parameter, a different quantum state may perform better. In the most extreme
case, we know nothing about the process and wish to learn everything. This
requires quantum process tomography, which demands an informationally-complete
set of probe states. It is very convenient if this set is group-covariant --
i.e., each element is generated by applying an element of the quantum system's
natural symmetry group to a single fixed fiducial state. In this paper, we
consider metrology with 2-photon (""biphoton"") states, and report experimental
studies of different states' sensitivity to small, unknown collective SU(2)
rotations (""SU(2) jitter""). Maximally entangled N00N states are the most
sensitive detectors of such a rotation, yet they are also among the worst at
fully characterizing an a-priori unknown process. We identify (and confirm
experimentally) the best SU(2)-covariant set for process tomography; these
states are all less entangled than the N00N state, and are characterized by the
fact that they form a 2-design.

field and a barotropic fluid. By employing a dynamical system analysis, we find
classical solutions corresponding to a naked singularity or a black hole
formation. We then investigate, in a semiclassical manner, loop quantum gravity
induced effects on the fate of the classical singularities. By employing an
inverse triad correction, we identify a subset which corresponds to an outward
flux of energy, thus avoiding either a naked singularity or a black hole
formation. Within a holonomy correction, we obtain the semiclassical
counterpart of our (classical) general relativistic collapse in which,
classical singularity is resolved and replaced by a bounce. In addition, we
find a threshold scale for non-singular black hole formation. In the second
scenario, we employ several models of dark energy to investigate the status of
the late time cosmological singularities. In the first one we consider a DGP
brane-world model with a GB term being provided for the bulk action; a phantom
matter is present on the brane as dark energy component. It is shown that a
combination of IR and UV modifications to general relativity replaces a big rip
by a sudden singularity at late times. The second model we cosnider is the
generalized running vacuum energy (GRVE) model. The Friedmann equation of the
GRVE model looks much similar to the one of a holographic Ricci dark energy
(HRDE) model. Despite the analogy between these two models, it turns out that
one of them, a GRVE, is singularity-free in the future while the other, the
HRDE, is not, which can hit, for example, a big rip singularity.

analytic terms appearing at the same chiral order play an important role in
this description. The same effects still hold for the chiral extrapolation of
the axial-vector charges and result in a rather mild quark-mass dependence. As

turbulence is complicated by the fact that the measurements are made in a frame
of reference in relative motion with respect to the turbulent plasma. The
Taylor hypothesis---that temporal fluctuations measured by a stationary probe
in a rapidly flowing fluid are dominated by the advection of spatial structures

measurements of turbulence in upcoming missions, such as Solar Probe Plus,
threaten to violate the Taylor hypothesis, either due to slow flow of the
plasma with respect to the spacecraft or to the dispersive nature of the plasma
fluctuations at small scales. Assuming that the frequency of the turbulent
fluctuations is characterized by the frequency of the linear waves supported by
the plasma, we evaluate the validity of the Taylor hypothesis for the linear
kinetic wave modes in the weakly collisional solar wind. The analysis predicts
that a dissipation range of solar wind turbulence supported by whistler waves

Alfven waves is not.

Instances of this problem show up in concurrent implementations of
transactional memory, flat combining, thread barriers, and memory reclamation
schemes for lock-free data structures. In this paper, we analyze a randomized
solution for long-lived renaming. The algorithmic technique we consider, called
the LevelArray, has previously been used for hashing and one-shot (single-use)
renaming. Our main contribu- tion is to prove that, in long-lived executions,
where processes may register and deregister polynomially many times, the
technique guarantees constant steps on average and O(log log n) steps with high
probability for registering, unit cost for deregistering, and O(n) steps for
collect queries, where n is an upper bound on the number of processes that may
be active at any point in time. We also show that the algorithm has the
surprising property that it is self-healing: under reasonable assumptions on
the schedule, operations running while the data structure is in a degraded
state implicitly help the data structure re-balance itself. This subtle
mechanism obviates the need for expensive periodic rebuilding procedures. Our
benchmarks validate this approach, showing that, for typical use parameters,
the average number of steps a process takes to register is less than two and
the worst-case number of steps is bounded by six, even in executions with
billions of operations. We contrast this with other randomized implementations,
whose worst-case behavior we show to be unreliable, and with deterministic

protocol and show that it allows better values for fidelity and Hilbert-Schmidt
norm than hitherto reported. This higher value for the fidelity is identical to
the maximum fidelity of phase covariant quantum cloning of Bru\ss
-Cinchetti-D'Ariano-Macchiavello. This value of fidelity has also been obtained
by Niu and Griffiths in their work without machine states. This is the maximum
possible fidelity obtainable in $1\rightarrow 2$ qubits cloning. We then
describe a different and new state dependent cloning protocol with four machine
states where all non-exact copies of input states are taken into account in the
output and we use the Hessian method of determining extrema of multivariate
functions. The fidelity for the best overall quantum cloning in this protocol
is $\bar{F}=0.847$ with an associated von-Neumann entropy of $\bar{S}=0.825$.

exhibiting robustness but adversely demanding a considerable computational load
and large storage. Alternative approaches include heuristic methods that employ
iterative optimization procedures for detecting multiple circles under the
inconvenience that only one circle can be marked at each optimization cycle
demanding a longer execution time. On the other hand, Learning Automata (LA) is
a heuristic method to solve complex multi-modal optimization problems. Although
LA converges to just one global minimum, the final probability distribution
holds valuable information regarding other local minima which have emerged
during the optimization process. The detection process is considered as a
multi-modal optimization problem, allowing the detection of multiple circular
shapes through only one optimization procedure. The algorithm uses a
combination of three edge points as parameters to determine circles candidates.
A reinforcement signal determines if such circle candidates are actually
present at the image. Guided by the values of such reinforcement signal, the
set of encoded candidate circles are evolved using the LA so that they can fit
into actual circular shapes over the edge-only map of the image. The overall
approach is a fast multiple-circle detector despite facing complicated
conditions.

implemented by ultracold atoms in optical superlattice transformation between
different configurations. This transformation may induce the collision and
division between boson and fermion, which defines a theoretical convective
pairing state. The paring Hamiltonian is Hermitian but it always generate a
complex energy spectrum. Each finite gap state can be classified by a
topological winding number. The stable pairing state only exists for certain
discrete momentum vector zones. An unstable linear dispersion connects two
neighboring stable pairing states. The boson-fermion gap function controls the
momentum gap space between two neighboring pairing state. The critical
temperature of transition from a gapped to gapless phase shows a maximal value
at negative fermion chemical potential. The density of state for the pairing
excitation diverges at low energy, thus most pairing states are observable at
low energy.

(IASI) of a graph $G$ is an injective function $f:V(G)\to

discuss about two special types of arithmetic IASIs.

  evaporation and new formulation",,,,,"cond-mat.other cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Even though the phenomenon of evaporation is omnipresent and has immense
scientific and technological importance, the research effort to unveil its
fundamentals remains inadequately low. As one particular consequence, the
textbooks and educational courses are lacking detailed explanation of
evaporation and its effects. In order to advance fundamental theory of
evaporation and increase accuracy of evaporation simulation a novel evaporation
theory is presented. This integrated Atomistic(Molecular)-Kinetics-Gasdynamics
theoretical model that combines statistical mechanics, gas dynamics and
thermodynamics approaches opens a path to detailed description of
nonstationary, nonequilibrium evaporation of condensed matter. The main
innovation of the proposed approach is that, unlike all previous and current
models of evaporation that are based on the assumption of evaporation as
emission of the particles that are not bound within the condense phase, the
described new model treats evaporation of condensed phase as escape of the
particles of sufficient kinetic energy out of potential well located at the
boundary of condensed and gaseous phases. Correspondingly, the re-condensation
of the vapor onto the surface is treated as entrapment of the vapor particles
with kietic energy lower than the depth of the potential well. The described
novel research will open new opportunities to substantially advance our
knowledge and provide needed contributions to chemical, combustion,
environmental, climate and other sciences that utilize evaporation theory.
Additionally, it will provide invaluable new material for the undergraduate and
graduate educational courses in Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, and Material
Sciences.
