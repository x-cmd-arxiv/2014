of a given string in a language, trying to convince a weak verifier whose coins
are visible to all. We show that the incorporation of just two qubits to an
otherwise classical constant-space verifier raises the class of debatable
languages from at most $\mathsf{NP}$ to the collection of all Turing-decidable
languages (recursive languages). When the verifier is further constrained to
make the correct decision with probability 1, the corresponding class goes up
from the regular languages up to at least $\mathsf{E}$. We also show that the
quantum model outperforms its classical counterpart when restricted to run in
polynomial time, and demonstrate some non-context-free languages which have
such short debates with quantum verifiers.

manipulate light in plasmonic nanostructures, which is based on steering
optical powerflow around nano-obstacles. New insights into plasmonic
nanofocusing mechanisms are obtained by invoking an analogy of the 'photon
fluid' (PF). By proper nanostructure design, PF kinetic energy can be locally
increased via convective acceleration and then converted into 'pressure' energy
to generate localized areas of high field intensity. In particular, trapped
light can be molded into optical vortices -tornado-like areas of circular
motion of power flux - connected into transmission-like sequences. In the
electromagnetic theory terms, this approach is based on radiationless
electromagnetic interference of evanescent fields rather than on interference
of propagating waves radiated by the dipoles induced in nanoparticles. The
resulting ability to manipulate optical powerflow well beyond the diffraction
limit helps to reduce dissipative losses, to increase the amount of energy
accumulated within a nanoscale volume, and to activate magnetic response in
non-magnetic nanostructures. It also forms a basis for long-range on-chip
energy transfer/routing as well as for active nanoscale field modulation and
switching.

distributed learning problems. Specifically we study the problem of estimating
the mean $\vec{\theta}$ of an unknown $d$ dimensional gaussian distribution in
the distributed setting. In this problem, the samples from the unknown
distribution are distributed among $m$ different machines. The goal is to
estimate the mean $\vec{\theta}$ at the optimal minimax rate while
communicating as few bits as possible. We show that in this setting, the
communication cost scales linearly in the number of dimensions i.e. one needs
to deal with different dimensions individually. Applying this result to
previous lower bounds for one dimension in the interactive setting
\cite{ZDJW13} and to our improved bounds for the simultaneous setting, we prove
new lower bounds of $\Omega(md/\log(m))$ and $\Omega(md)$ for the bits of
communication needed to achieve the minimax squared loss, in the interactive
and simultaneous settings respectively. To complement, we also demonstrate an
interactive protocol achieving the minimax squared loss with $O(md)$ bits of
communication, which improves upon the simple simultaneous protocol by a
logarithmic factor. Given the strong lower bounds in the general setting, we
initiate the study of the distributed parameter estimation problems with
structured parameters. Specifically, when the parameter is promised to be
$s$-sparse, we show a simple thresholding based protocol that achieves the same
squared loss while saving a $d/s$ factor of communication. We conjecture that
the tradeoff between communication and squared loss demonstrated by this
protocol is essentially optimal up to logarithmic factor.

account efficiently and accurately for the lack of long-range vdW forces in
most popular DFT exchange-correlation functionals. Here we have used these two

surfaces upon which it either physisorbs (Cu, Ag, and Au) or chemisorbs (Rh,
Pd, Ir, and Pt). We have thoroughly compared the performance between the two

obtained with experimental data. By examining the computed adsorption energies,
equilibrium distances, and binding curves we conclude that both methods allow
for an accurate treatment of adsorption at equilibrium adsorbate-substrate
distances. To this end, explicit inclusion of electrodynamic screening in the
interatomic vdW scheme and optimized exchange functionals in the case of
nonlocal vdW density functionals is mandatory. Nevertheless, some discrepancies
are found between these two classes of methods at large adsorbate-substrate

the usual approach adopted in numerical explorations of their stability, where
the planets are initially separated by multiples of the mutual Hill radius,
appears too reducing. A detailed sampling of the parameter space reveals that
systems with more packed inner planets are stable well within previous

points that belong to a significantly larger massive dataset (i.e., Big Data).
The small number of selected data points must adequately represent and
faithfully characterize the massive Big Data. Such identification process is
known as representative selection [19]. We propose a novel representative
selection framework by generating an l1 norm sparse graph for a given Big-Data
dataset. The Big Data is partitioned recursively into clusters using a spectral
clustering algorithm on the generated sparse graph. We consider each cluster as
one point in a Grassmann manifold, and measure the geodesic distance among
these points. The distances are further analyzed using a min-max algorithm [1]
to extract an optimal subset of clusters. Finally, by considering a sparse
subgraph of each selected cluster, we detect a representative using principal
component centrality [11]. We refer to the proposed representative selection
framework as a Sparse Graph and Grassmann Manifold (SGGM) based approach. To
validate the proposed SGGM framework, we apply it onto the problem of video
summarization where only few video frames, known as key frames, are selected
among a much longer video sequence. A comparison of the results obtained by the
proposed algorithm with the ground truth, which is agreed by multiple human
judges, and with some state-of-the-art methods clearly indicates the viability
of the SGGM framework.

Gauged M-flation is a string theory motivated inflation model with Matrix
valued scalar inflaton fields in the adjoint representation of a $U(N)$
Yang-Mills theory. In continuation of our previous works, we show that in the
M-flation model induced from a supersymmetric 10d background probed by a stack
of $N$ D3-branes, the ""effective inflaton"" $\phi$ has a double-well Higgs-like
potential, with minima at $\phi=0,\mu$. We focus on the $\phi>\mu$,
symmetry-breaking region. We thoroughly examine predictions of the model for
$r$ in the $2\sigma$ region allowed for $n_S$ by the Planck experiment. As
computed in [arXiv:0903.1481], for $N_e=60$ and $n_S=0.96$ we find $r\simeq
0.2$, which sits in the sweet spot of BICEP2 region for $r$. We find that with
increasing $\mu$ arbitrarily, $n_S$ cannot go beyond $\simeq 0.9670$. As $n_S$
varies in the $2\sigma$ range which is allowed by Planck and could be reached
by the model, $r$ varies in the range $[0.1322,0.2623]$. Future cosmological
experiments, like the CMBPOL, that confines $n_S$ with $\sigma(n_S)=0.0029$ can
constrain the model further. Also, in this region of potential, for
$n_S=0.9603$, we find that the largest isocurvature mode, which is uncorrelated
with curvature perturbations, has a power spectrum with the amplitude of order
$10^{-11}$ at the end of inflation. We also discuss the range of predictions of
$r$ in the hilltop region, $\phi< \mu$.

increases with population density. Coupled with environmental fluctuations in
demographic rates, Allee effects can have subtle effects on population
persistence and extinction. To understand the interplay between these
deterministic and stochastic forces, we analyze discrete-time single species
models allowing for general forms of density-dependent feedbacks and stochastic
fluctuations in demographic rates. Our analysis provide criteria for stochastic
persistence, asymptotic extinction, and conditional persistence. Stochastic
persistence requires that the geometric mean of fitness at low densities is
greater than one. When this geometric mean is less than one, asymptotic
extinction occurs with a high probability whenever the initial population
density is low. If in addition the population only experiences positive
density-dependent feedbacks, conditional persistence occurs provided the
geometric mean of fitness at high population densities is greater than one.
However, if the population experiences both positive and negative
density-dependent feedbacks, conditional persistence is only possible if
fluctuations in demographic rates are sufficiently small. Applying our results
to stochastic models of mate-limitation, we illustrate counter-intuitively that
the environmental fluctuations can increase the probability of persistence when
populations are initially at low densities, and decrease the likelihood of
persistence when populations are initially at high densities. Alternatively,
for stochastic models accounting for predator saturation and negative
density-dependence, environmental stochasticity can result in asymptotic
extinction at intermediate predation rates despite conditional persistence
occurring at higher predation rates.

collaboratively search for a target in a two-dimensional plane. Because this
problem is inspired by the behavior of biological species, we argue that in
addition to studying the {\em time complexity} of solutions it is also
important to study the {\em selection complexity}, a measure of how likely a
given algorithmic strategy is to arise in nature due to selective pressures. In
more detail, we propose a new selection complexity metric $\chi$, defined for
algorithm ${\cal A}$ such that $\chi({\cal A}) = b + \log \ell$, where $b$ is
the number of memory bits used by each agent and $\ell$ bounds the fineness of
available probabilities (agents use probabilities of at least $1/2^\ell$). In
this paper, we study the trade-off between the standard performance metric of
speed-up, which measures how the expected time to find the target improves with
$n$, and our new selection metric.
  In particular, consider $n$ agents searching for a treasure located at
(unknown) distance $D$ from the origin (where $n$ is sub-exponential in $D$).
For this problem, we identify $\log \log D$ as a crucial threshold for our
selection complexity metric. We first prove a new upper bound that achieves a
near-optimal speed-up of $(D^2/n +D) \cdot 2^{O(\ell)}$ for $\chi({\cal A})
\leq 3 \log \log D + O(1)$. In particular, for $\ell \in O(1)$, the speed-up is
asymptotically optimal. By comparison, the existing results for this problem
[Feinerman et al.] that achieve similar speed-up require $\chi({\cal A}) =
\Omega(\log D)$. We then show that this threshold is tight by describing a
lower bound showing that if $\chi({\cal A}) < \log \log D - \omega(1)$, then
with high probability the target is not found within $D^{2-o(1)}$ moves per
agent. Hence, there is a sizable gap to the straightforward $\Omega(D^2/n + D)$
lower bound in this setting.

the manner most commonly used in the literature. We develop a new estimator
that is free from this bias and use it to estimate the true underlying
structure function slope on length scales ranging $5$ to $40$~AU. From a power
law fit to the structure function, we derive a slope of $0.81^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$,

for the amplitude of the structure function is also consistent with the
measurements carried out at parsec scales. Our measurements are hence
consistent with the \HI opacity fluctuation in the Galaxy being characterized
by a power law structure function over length scales that span six orders of
magnitude. This result implies that the dissipation scale has to be smaller

equal to one. In this comment we prove out that their claims are erroneous. In
order to show incorrectness of Maletic & Rajkovic model and conclusions we
calculated and examined connections between different combinatorial structures

from impulsive heating events, or nanoflares, that occur in the lower
atmosphere, either in the upper part of the ordinary chromosphere or at the
tips of type II spicules. We test this idea with a series of hydrodynamic
simulations. We find that synthetic Fe XII (195) and Fe XIV (274) line profiles
generated from the simulations disagree dramatically with actual observations.
The integrated line intensities are much too faint; the blue shifts are much
too fast; the blue-red asymmetries are much too large; and the emission is
confined to low altitudes. We conclude that chromospheric nanoflares are not a
primary source of hot coronal plasma. Such events may play an important role in
producing the chromosphere and powering its intense radiation, but they do not,
in general, raise the temperature of the plasma to coronal values. Those cases
where coronal temperatures are reached must be relatively uncommon. The
observed profiles of Fe XII and Fe XIV come primarily from plasma that is
heated in the corona itself, either by coronal nanoflares or a quasi-steady
coronal heating process. Chromospheric nanoflares might play a role in
generating waves that provide this coronal heating.

solid state physics. The desire to tune the topological invariants of the bulk

experimentalists towards periodically driving parameters of these systems. In
such periodically driven setups, by varying the drive sequence the effective
(Floquet) Hamiltonian can be engineered to be topological: then, the principle
of bulk--boundary correspondence guarantees the existence of robust edge
states. It has also been realized, however, that periodically driven systems
can host edge states not predicted by the Floquet Hamiltonian. The exploration
of such edge states, and the corresponding topological phases unique to
periodically driven systems, has only recently begun. We contribute to this
goal by identifying the bulk topological invariants of periodically driven
one-dimensional lattice Hamiltonians with chiral symmetry. We find simple
closed expressions for these invariants, as winding numbers of blocks of the
unitary operator corresponding to a part of the time evolution, and ways to
tune these invariants using sublattice shifts. We illustrate our ideas on the
periodically driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, which we map to a discrete time
quantum walk, allowing theoretical results about either of these systems to be
applied to the other. Our work helps interpret the results of recent
simulations where a large number of Floquet Majorana fermions in periodically
driven superconductors have been found, and of recent experiments on discrete

much lower luminosities than the classical samples of distant radio sources and
similar to those of the local population of radio galaxies. The wide
multiwavelength coverage provided by the COSMOS survey allows us to derive
their Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs). The SED modeling with stellar and
dust components (with our code 2SPD) returns several important quantities
associated with the AGN and host properties. The final sample consists of 74 RL
AGN, which extends the sample previously selected by Chiaberge et al. (2009)
and studied by Baldi et al. (2013). The resulting photometric redshifts range
from z~0.7 to 3. The sample mostly includes compact radio sources, but also 21
FRIIs; the radio power distribution of the sample at 1.4 GHz covers
~10^(31.5)-10^(34.3) \erg\s\Hz. The stellar mass of the hosts ranges
~10^(10)-10^(11.5) M_{sun}. The SEDs are dominated by the contribution from an
old stellar population for most of the sources. UV and mid-IR (MIR) excesses
are observed for half of the sample. The dust luminosities are in the range
L_(dust) ~10^(43)-10^(45.5) erg/s (T ~350-1200 K). UV luminosities at 2000 A
ranges ~10^(41.5)-10^(45.5) erg/s. UV emission is significantly correlated with
both IR and radio luminosities, the former being the stronger link. However,
the origin of UV and dust emission, whether it is produced by the AGN of by
star formation, is still unclear. Our results show that this RL AGN population
at high redshifts displays a wide variety of properties from possible quasars
at the highest luminosities, to low-luminosity old galaxies, similarly to the
local FRI-FRII dichotomy.

energy theory of the $Z_3$ generalized Kitaev model (GKM) is described by a
single $Z_3$ parafermion per lattice site coupled to a $Z_3$ gauge field. We
also introduce a slave-fermion approach for this GKM, treat the resulting
fermionic Hamiltonian at the mean-field level, solve the mean field parameters
self-consistently, and obtain the low energy effective Chern-Simons (CS) gauge
theory. The resulting CS gauge theory is identical to that of a (221)
fractional quantum Hall state. We then go beyond the mean-field approximation
and demonstrate that fluctuations generate a uniform interlayer pairing for the
dual (221) bilayer state. We argue that this perturbed system can undergo a
phase transition to the Fibonacci phase by tuning the interlayer pairing
strength.

central ellipticities and position angles. We show that in all cases where the
central ellipticity permits an accurate measurement of the position angle,
those angles are in excellent agreement with the kinematic position angles that
we derive from the VIRUS-W velocity fields. We find an unexpected tight
correlation between central rotation and outer ellipticity, indicating that
rotation drives flattening for the objects in our sample. We also find a tight
correlation between central rotation and published values for the central
velocity dispersion, most likely due to rotation impacting the old dispersion

their structure at z=0 by decomposing them into ""mono-age populations"" (MAPs)

merging activity at high redshift, so that stars older than 9 Gyr are found in
a centrally concentrated component, while younger stars are mostly found in

Because a large range of merger histories can create populations with simple
structures, this suggests that the simplicity of the structure of
mono-abundance populations observed in the Milky Way by Bovy et al. (2012b,c)
is not necessarily a direct indicator of a quiescent history for the Milky Way.
Similarly, the anti-correlation between scale-length and scale-height does not
necessarily imply a merger-free history. However, mergers produce
discontinuities between thin and thick disc components, and jumps in the
age-velocity relation. The absence of a structural discontinuity between thin
and thick disc observed in the Milky Way would seem to be a good indicator that
no merger with a mass ratio larger than 1:15-1:10 occurred in the last 9 Gyr.
Mergers at higher redshift might nevertheless be necessary to produce the

mergers being able to create jumps in the AVR (although these jumps might not
be detectable if the errors on stellar ages are on the order of 30%). For
galaxies with a quiescent history at low redshift, we find that the vertical
velocity dispersion rises smoothly for ages up to 8-9 Gyr, following a power
law with a slope of ~0.5, similar to what is observed in the solar
neighbourhood by the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey. For these galaxies, we show that
the slope of the AVR is not imprinted at birth, but is the result of subsequent
heating. By contrast, in all our simulations, the oldest stars form a
significantly different population, with a high velocity dispersion. These
stars are usually born kinematically hot in a turbulent phase of intense
mergers at high redshift, and also include some stars accreted from satellites.
This maximum in velocity dispersion is strongly decreased when age errors are

sensitive to diverse searches for dark matter annihilation, including
annihilation from extended dark matter sources, the diffuse gamma-ray emission
from dark matter annihilation, and gamma-ray emission from non-luminous dark
matter subhalos. Here we consider the HAWC sensitivity to a subset of these
sources, including dwarf galaxies, the M31 galaxy, the Virgo cluster, and the
Galactic center. We simulate the HAWC response to gamma rays from these sources
in several well-motivated dark matter annihilation channels. If no gamma-ray
excess is observed, we show the limits HAWC can place on the dark matter
cross-section from these sources. In particular, in the case of dark matter
annihilation into gauge bosons, HAWC will be able to detect a narrow range of
dark matter masses to cross-sections below thermal. HAWC should also be
sensitive to non-thermal cross-sections for masses up to nearly 1000 TeV. The
constraints placed by HAWC on the dark matter cross-section from known sources
should be competitive with current limits in the mass range where HAWC has
similar sensitivity. HAWC can additionally explore higher dark matter masses
than are currently constrained.

to intrinsic differences between systems that show and those that do not show

are likely background active galactic nuclei or ULXs residing in star clusters.
Eleven counterparts have absolute magnitudes consistent with them being single

scenarios such as emission from a surrounding nebula or from a compact radio

from two migration channels or from two tidal realignment regimes. Here I
demonstrate that equilibrium tides raised by a planet on its star can account
for three observed spin-orbit alignment trends: the aligned orbits of hot
Jupiters orbiting cool stars, the planetary mass cut-off for retrograde
planets, and the stratification by planet mass of cool host stars' rotation
frequencies. The first trend can be caused by strong versus weak magnetic
braking (the Kraft break), rather than realignment of the star's convective
envelope versus the entire star. The second trend can result from a small
effective stellar moment of inertia participating in the tidal realignment in
hot stars, enabling massive retrograde planets to partially realign to become
prograde. The third trend is attributable to higher mass planets more
effectively counteracting braking to spin up their stars. Both hot and cool
star require a small effective stellar moment of inertia participating in the
tidal realignment, e.g., an outer layer weakly coupled to the interior. I
demonstrate via Monte Carlo that this model can match the observed trends and
distributions of sky-projected misalignments and stellar rotation frequencies.

z=3 to z=1 the galaxies move from disk-dominated to increasingly
bulge-dominated, but very few galaxies are pure bulges/ellipticals by z=1; ii)
while most passive galaxies are bulge-dominated, and most star-forming galaxies
disk-dominated, 18+/-5% of passive galaxies are disk-dominated, and 11+/-3% of
star-forming galaxies are bulge-dominated, a result which needs to be explained
by any model purporting to connect star-formation quenching with morphological
transformations; iii) there exists a small but significant population of pure
passive disks, which are generally flatter than their star-forming counterparts
(whose axial ratio distribution peaks at b/a~0.7); iv) flatter/larger disks
re-emerge at the highest star-formation rates, consistent with recent studies
of sub-mm galaxies, and with the concept of a maximum surface-density for
star-formation activity.

HzRGs from radio surveys of moderate depths, fainter USS samples derived from
deeper radio surveys can be useful in finding HzRGs at even higher redshifts
and in unveiling a population of obscured weaker radio-loud AGN at moderate
redshifts. Using our 325 MHz GMRT observations (5-sigma ~ 800 microJy) and 1.4

(viz., VLA-VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VLA-VVDS) and Subaru X-ray Deep Field (SXDF))
of the XMM-LSS field, we derive a large sample of 160 faint USS radio sources
and characterize their nature. The optical, IR counterparts of our USS sample
sources are searched using existing deep surveys, at respective wavelengths. We
attempt to unveil the nature of our faint USS sources using diagnostic
techniques based on mid-IR colors, flux ratios of radio to mid-IR, and radio
luminosities. Redshift estimates are available for 86/116 (~ 74%) USS sources
in the VLA-VVDS field and for 39/44 (~ 87%) USS sources in the SXDF fields with
median values (z_median) ~ 1.18 and ~ 1.57, which are higher than that for
non-USS radio sources (z_median non-USS ~ 0.99 and ~ 0.96), in the two
subfields, respectively. The flux ratio of radio to mid-IR (S_1.4 GHz/S_3.6
micron) versus redshift diagnostic plot suggests that more than half of our USS
sample sources distributed over z ~ 0.5 to 3.8 are likely to be hosted in
obscured environments. A significant fraction (~ 26% in the VLA-VVDS and ~ 13%
in the SXDF) of our USS sources without redshift estimates mostly remain
unidentified in the existing optical, IR surveys, and exhibit high radio to

desirable characteristics one has to understand the origin of helicity of their
structures. Here, through in situ microscopy we demonstrate that the nucleation
of a carbon nanotube is initiated by the formation of the carbon cap.
Nucleation begins with the formation of a graphene embryo that is bound between
opposite step-edges on the nickel catalyst surface. The embryo grows larger as
the step-edges migrate along the surface, leading to the formation of a curved
carbon cap when the steps flow across the edges of adjacent facets. Further
motion of the steps away from the catalyst tip with attached rims of the carbon
cap generates the wall of the nanotube. Density Functional Theory calculations
bring further insight into the process, showing that step flow occurs by
surface self diffusion of the nickel atoms via a step-edge
attachment-detachment mechanism. Since the fact that cap forms first in the
sequence of stages involved in nanotube growth, we suggest that it originates
the helicity of the nanotube. Therefore, the angular distribution of catalyst
facets could be exploited as a new parameter for controlling the curvature of
the cap and, presumably, the helicity of the nanotube.

Fluid Mech",,"10.1017/jfm.2014.269",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The numerical simulation of a flow through a duct requires an externally
specified forcing that makes the fluid flow against viscous friction. To this
aim, it is customary to enforce a constant value for either the flow rate (CFR)
or the pressure gradient (CPG). When comparing a laminar duct flow before and
after a geometrical modification that induces a change of the viscous drag,
both approaches (CFR and CPG) lead to a change of the power input across the
comparison. Similarly, when carrying out the (DNS and LES) numerical simulation
of unsteady turbulent flows, the power input is not constant over time.
Carrying out a simulation at constant power input (CPI) is thus a further
physically sound option, that becomes particularly appealing in the context of
flow control, where a comparison between control-on and control-off conditions
has to be made.
  We describe how to carry out a CPI simulation, and start with defining a new
power-related Reynolds number, whose velocity scale is the bulk flow that can
be attained with a given pumping power in the laminar regime. Under the CPI
condition, we derive a relation that is equivalent to the
Fukagata--Iwamoto--Kasagi relation valid for CFR (and to its extension valid
for CPG), that presents the additional advantage of natively including the
required control power. The implementation of the CPI approach is then
exemplified in the standard case of a plane turbulent channel flow, and then
further applied to a flow control case, where the spanwise-oscillating wall is
used for skin friction drag reduction. For this low-Reynolds number flow, using
90% of the available power for the pumping system and the remaining 10% for the
control system is found to be the optimum share that yields the largest
increase of the flow rate above the reference case, where 100% of the power
goes to the pump.

$\Phi_1 \otimes \Phi_2 \otimes \ldots \Phi_N$ with the power gain $\kappa_i \ge

quantum limited performance for any degree of attenuation or gain. We detect
entanglement preservation properties of the channel $\Phi_1 \otimes \Phi_2$,

non-gaussian states are at an advantage in the case of symmetric attenuation

circular ground state. While one of these is familiar from the Euler-Plateau
problem, the other encompasses information about the ratio of the twisting to
bending rigidities, twist, and size of the loop. For sufficiently small values
of the latter parameter, two separate groups of bifurcation modes are
identified. On the other hand, for values greater than the critical twist
arising in Michell's problem of the bifurcation of a twisted annular ring, only
one bifurcation mode exists. Bifurcation diagrams indicate that a loop with
greater twisting rigidity shows more resistance to transverse buckling.
However, a twisted and closed filament spanned by a surface endowed with
uniform surface tension buckles at a twist less than the critical value for an

optimizing the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) in half-duplex wireless
relay networks? This is motivated by apparently two contrasting results even
for a simple 3 node network, with a single half-duplex relay. When all channels
are assumed to be i.i.d. fading, a static schedule where the relay listens half
the time and transmits half the time combined with quantize-map-forward (QMF)
relaying is known to achieve the full-duplex performance. However, when there
is no direct link between source and destination, a dynamic-decode-forward
(DDF) strategy is needed to achieve the optimal tradeoff. In this case, a
static schedule is strictly suboptimal and the optimal tradeoff is
significantly worse than the full-duplex performance. In this paper we study
the general case when the direct link is neither as strong as the other links
nor fully non-existent, and identify regimes where dynamic schedules are
necessary and those where static schedules are enough. We identify 4
qualitatively different regimes for the single relay channel where the tradeoff
between diversity and multiplexing is significantly different. We show that in
all these regimes one of the above two strategies is sufficient to achieve the
optimal tradeoff by developing a new upper bound on the best achievable
tradeoff under channel state information available only at the receivers. A
natural next question is whether these two strategies are sufficient to achieve

(MIP) solvers, since they help in solving the linear programs encountered

the integer hull by just using sparse cutting-planes? In order to understand
this question better, given a polyope $P$ (e.g. the integer hull of a MIP), let
$P^k$ be its best approximation using cuts with at most $k$ non-zero
coefficients. We consider $d(P, P^k) = \max_{x \in P^k} \left(min_{y \in P} \|

  In our first result, we present general upper bounds on $d(P, P^k)$ which
depend on the number of vertices in the polytope and exhibits three phases as
$k$ increases. Our bounds imply that if $P$ has polynomially many vertices,
using half sparsity already approximates it very well. Second, we present a
lower bound on $d(P, P^k)$ for random polytopes that show that the upper bounds

competing in a single market of a homogeneous good. Each firm tries to maximize
its utility---a function of the production cost as well as market price of the
product---by deciding on the amount of production. In today's dynamic and
diverse economy, many firms often compete in more than one market
simultaneously, i.e., each market might be shared among a subset of these
firms. In this situation, a bipartite graph models the access restriction where
firms are on one side, markets are on the other side, and edges demonstrate
whether a firm has access to a market or not. We call this game \emph{Network
Cournot Competition} (NCC). In this paper, we propose algorithms for finding
pure Nash equilibria of NCC games in different situations. First, we carefully
design a potential function for NCC, when the price functions for markets are
linear functions of the production in that market. However, for nonlinear price
functions, this approach is not feasible. We model the problem as a nonlinear
complementarity problem in this case, and design a polynomial-time algorithm
that finds an equilibrium of the game for strongly convex cost functions and
strongly monotone revenue functions. We also explore the class of price
functions that ensures strong monotonicity of the revenue function, and show it
consists of a broad class of functions. Moreover, we discuss the uniqueness of
equilibria in both of these cases which means our algorithms find the unique
equilibria of the games. Last but not least, when the cost of production in one
market is independent from the cost of production in other markets for all
firms, the problem can be separated into several independent classical
\emph{Cournot Oligopoly} problems. We give the first combinatorial algorithm
for this widely studied problem.

we propose an innovative cooperative beamforming technique. In particular, the
cooperative beamforming design is formulated as an optimization problem that
maximizes the weighted sum achievable transmission rate of secondary
destinations while it maintains the asynchronous interferences at the primary
receivers below their target thresholds. In light of the intractability of the
problem, we propose a two-phase suboptimal cooperative beamforming technique.
First, it finds the beamforming directions corresponding to different secondary
destinations. Second, it allocates the power among different beamforming
directions. Due to the multiple interference constraints corresponding to
multiple primary receivers, the power allocation scheme in the second phase is
still complex. Therefore, we also propose a low complex power allocation
algorithm. The proposed beamforming technique is extended for the cases, when

investigate a merger-feature time useful for understanding the morphological
transformation of galaxy mergers via numerical simulations. We use
N-body/hydrodynamic simulations, including gas cooling, star formation, and
supernova feedback. We run a set of simulations with various initial orbital
configurations and with progenitor galaxies having different morphological
properties mainly for equal-mass mergers. As reference models, we ran
additional simulations for non-equal mass mergers and mergers in a large halo
potential. Mock images using the SDSS $r$ band are synthesized to estimate a
merger-feature times and compare it between the merger simulations. The mock
images suggest that the post-merger features involve a small fraction of stars,
and the merger-feature time depends on galaxy interactions. In an isolated
environment, the merger-feature time is, on average, $\sim$ 2 times the final
coalescence time for a shallow surface bright limit of 25 mag/arcsec^2. For a
deeper surface brightness limit of 28 mag/arcsec^2, however, the merger-feature
time is a factor of two longer, which is why the detection of post-merger
features using shallow surveys has been difficult. Tidal force of a cluster
potential is effective in stripping post-merger features out and reduces the
merger-feature time.

WC-type and WN-type Wolf-Rayet stars at low metallicities, but underestimate
the ratio at higher (solar and above) metallicities. One possible explanation
for this failure is perhaps single-star models are not sufficient and
Roche-lobe overflow in close binaries is necessary to produce the ""extra"" WC
stars at higher metallicities. However, this would require the frequency of
close massive binaries to be metallicity dependent. Here we test this
hypothesis by searching for close Wolf-Rayet binaries in the high metallicity
environments of M31 and the center of M33 as well as in the lower metallicity
environments of the middle and outer regions of M33. After identifying ~100
Wolf-Rayet binaries based on radial velocity variations, we conclude that the
close binary frequency of Wolf-Rayets is not metallicity dependent and thus
other factors must be responsible for the overabundance of WC stars at high

and understanding the properties of its eigenvalues is of primary importance
for many hypothesis testing problems like testing the equality between two
multivariate population covariance matrices, or testing the independence
between sub-groups of a multivariate random vector. This paper is concerned
with the properties of a large-dimensional Fisher matrix when the dimension of
the population is proportionally large compared to the sample size. Most of
existing works on Fisher matrices deal with a particular Fisher matrix where
populations have i.i.d components so that the population covariance matrices
are all identity. In this paper, we consider general Fisher matrices with
arbitrary population covariance matrices. The first main result of the paper
establishes the limiting distribution of the eigenvalues of a Fisher matrix
while in a second main result, we provide a central limit theorem for a wide
class of functionals of its eigenvalues. Some applications of these results are
also proposed for testing hypotheses on high-dimensional covariance matrices.

improving the quality of recommender systems and encouraged the research
community to investigate better ways of exploiting the social information for

we exploit users' interactions along three data sources (marketplace, social
network and location-based) to assess their performance in a barely studied
domain: recommending products and domains of interests (i.e., product
categories) to people in an online marketplace environment. To that end we
defined sets of content- and network-based user similarity features for each
data source and studied them isolated using an user-based Collaborative
Filtering (CF) approach and in combination via a hybrid recommender algorithm,
to assess which one provides the best recommendation performance.
Interestingly, in our experiments conducted on a rich dataset collected from
SecondLife, a popular online virtual world, we found that recommenders relying
on user similarity features obtained from the social network data clearly
yielded the best results in terms of accuracy in case of predicting products,
whereas the features obtained from the marketplace and location-based data
sources also obtained very good results in case of predicting categories. This
finding indicates that all three types of data sources are important and should
be taken into account depending on the level of specialization of the
recommendation task.

they are subject to extreme tidal forces. This has a profound effect on their

34 known short period hot-Jupiters, assuming surfaces of constant gravitational
equipotential for the planet, and the resulting densities have been calculated
based only on observed parameters of the exoplanet systems. Comparing these
results to the density values assuming the planets are spherical shows that
there is an appreciable change in the measured density for planets with very
short periods (typically less than two days). For one of the shortest-period

effects, though their confirmation with Planck data suggests they are not due
to a problem in the WMAP or Planck pipelines. If these anomalies are in fact
primordial, then understanding their origin is fundamental to either validate
the standard model of cosmology or to explore new physics. We investigate three
other possible issues: 1) the trade-off between minimising systematics due to
foreground contamination (with a conservative mask) and minimising systematics
due to masking, 2) astrophysical secondary effects (the kinetic Doppler
quadrupole and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect), and 3) secondary
cosmological signals (the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect). We address the
masking issue by considering new procedures that use both WMAP and Planck to
produce higher quality full-sky maps using the sparsity methodology (LGMCA
maps). We show the impact of masking is dominant over that of residual
foregrounds, and the LGMCA full-sky maps can be used without further processing
to study anomalies. We consider four official Planck PR1 and two LGMCA CMB
maps. Analysis of the observed CMB maps shows that only the low quadrupole and
quadrupole-octopole alignment seem significant, but that the planar octopole,
Axis of Evil, mirror parity and cold spot are not significant in nearly all
maps considered. After subtraction of astrophysical and cosmological secondary
effects, only the low quadrupole may still be considered anomalous, meaning the
significance of only one anomaly is affected by secondary effect subtraction
out of six anomalies considered. In the spirit of reproducible research all

introduction in 2008, Bitcoin has gained noticeable popularity, mostly due to
its following properties: (1) the transaction fees are very low, and (2) it is
not controlled by any central authority, which in particular means that nobody
can ""print"" the money to generate inflation. Moreover, the transaction syntax
allows to create the so-called contracts, where a number of
mutually-distrusting parties engage in a protocol to jointly perform some
financial task, and the fairness of this process is guaranteed by the
properties of Bitcoin. Although the Bitcoin contracts have several potential
applications in the digital economy, so far they have not been widely used in
real life. This is partly due to the fact that they are cumbersome to create
and analyze, and hence risky to use.
  In this paper we propose to remedy this problem by using the methods
originally developed for the computer-aided analysis for hardware and software
systems, in particular those based on the timed automata. More concretely, we
propose a framework for modeling the Bitcoin contracts using the timed automata
in the UPPAAL model checker. Our method is general and can be used to model
several contracts. As a proof-of-concept we use this framework to model some of
the Bitcoin contracts from our recent previous work. We then automatically
verify their security in UPPAAL, finding (and correcting) some subtle errors
that were difficult to spot by the manual analysis. We hope that our work can
draw the attention of the researchers working on formal modeling to the problem
of the Bitcoin contract verification, and spark off more research on this
topic.

the cosmological constant. We determine explicitly the constraints, and from
the initial value formulation show that the time-dependent solutions can have
singularities at a finite time. Although the constraints give, as in the
$\beta_1$ case, the correct number of degrees of freedom for a massive spin two

a singular time evolution. This is very different to the $\beta_1$ case where
time evolution is always well defined. We conclude that the $\beta_3$ mass term

Generalizing results of Conti, we prove that for large classes of solvable Lie

with parallel $SU(3)$-, $G_2$- or $Spin(7)$-structure which is of cohomogeneity
one with respect to $G$ is flat, and has no singular orbits.

half-flat $SU(3)$-structures which are bi-invariant with respect to the maximal
compact subgroup $SU(2)$ and solve the Hitchin flow for these initial values.
It turns out that often the flow collapses to a smooth manifold in one
direction. In this way we recover an incomplete cohomogeneity-one Riemannian

certain marginal integration regression technique for a very general class of
potentially nonlinear structural equation models (SEMs) with known structure,
or at least known superset of adjustment variables: we call the procedure
S-mint regression. We easily derive that it achieves the convergence rate as
for nonparametric regression: for example, single variable intervention effects
can be estimated with convergence rate $n^{-2/5}$ assuming smoothness with
twice differentiable functions. Our result can also be seen as a major
robustness property with respect to model misspecification which goes much
beyond the notion of double robustness. Furthermore, when the structure of the
SEM is not known, we can estimate (the equivalence class of) the directed
acyclic graph corresponding to the SEM, and then proceed by using S-mint based
on these estimates. We empirically compare the S-mint regression method with

  Vignale, V. Pellegrini, and J.K. Jain",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  I present a theoretical study of current-voltage characteristics ($I$-$V$
curves ) of small Josephson junctions. In the limit of a small Josephson
coupling energy $E_J \ll k_B T$ the thermal fluctuations result in a stochastic
dependence of the Josephson phase $\varphi$ on time, i.e the Josephson phase
diffusion. These thermal fluctuations destroy the superconducting state, and
the low-voltage resistive state is characterized by a nonlinear $I$-$V$ curve.
Such $I$-$V$ curve is determined by the resonant interaction of ac Josephson
current with the Josephson phase oscillations excited in the junction. The main
frequency of ac Josephson current is $\omega=eV/\hbar$, where $V$ is the
voltage drop on the junction. In the phase diffusion regime the Josephson phase
oscillations show a broad spectrum of frequencies. The average $I$-$V$ curve is
determined by the time-dependent correlations of the Josephson phase. By making
use of the method of averaging elaborated in Ref. M. V. Fistul and G. F.
Giuliani, Phys. Rev. B 56, 788 (1997), for Josephson junctions with randomly
distributed Abrikosov vortices I will be able to obtain two regimes: a linear
regime as the amplitudes of excited phase oscillations are small, and a
strongly nonlinear regime as both the amplitudes of excited Josephson phase
oscillations and the strength of resonant interaction are large. The latter
regime can be realized in the case of low dissipation. The crossover between
these regimes is analyzed.

range of fundamental light. The frequency conversion of OAM-carrying light
gives rise to new physics and applications such as up-conversion detection of
images and high dimensional OAM entanglements. Quasi-phase matching (QPM)
nonlinear crystals are good candidates for frequency conversion, particularly
for their high-valued effective nonlinear coefficients and no walk-off effect.
Here we report the first experimental second-harmonic generation (SHG) of OAM
light with a QPM crystal, where a UV light with OAM of 100 is generated. OAM
conservation is verified using a specially designed interferometer. With a pump
beam carrying an OAM superposition of opposite sign, we observed interesting
interference phenomena in the SHG light; specifically, a photonics gear-like
structure is obtained that gives direct evidence of OAM conservation, which
will be very useful for ultra-sensitive angular measurements. We also develop a
theory to reveal the underlying physics of the phenomena. The methods and
theoretical analysis shown here are also applicable to other frequency
conversion processes, such as sum frequency generation and difference-frequency
generation, and may also be generalized to the quantum regime for single

planets can explain many properties of the present Solar System, and can be
used to constrain its early architecture. In the jumping-Jupiter version of the
Nice model, required from the terrestrial planet constraint and dynamical
structure of the asteroid belt, Jupiter has encounters with an ice giant. Here
we study the survival of the Galilean satellites in the jumping-Jupiter model.
This is an important concern because the ice-giant encounters, if deep enough,
could dynamically perturb the orbits of the Galilean satellites, and lead to
implausible results. We performed numerical integrations where we tracked the
effect of planetary encounters on the Galilean moons. We considered three
instability cases from Nesvorny & Morbidelli (2012) that differed in the number
and distribution of encounters. We found that in one case, where the number of
close encounters was relatively small, the Galilean satellite orbits were not
significantly affected. In the other two, the orbital eccentricities of all
moons were excited by encounters, Callisto's semimajor axis changed, and, in a
large fraction of trials, the Laplace resonance of the inner three moons was
disrupted. The subsequent evolution by tides damps eccentricities and can
recapture the moons in the Laplace resonance. A more important constraint is
represented by the orbital inclinations of the moons, which can be excited
during the encounters and not appreciably damped by tides. We find that one
instability case taken from Nesvorny & Morbidelli (2012) clearly fails this
constraint. This shows how the regular satellites of Jupiter can be used to set
limits on the properties of encounters in the jumping-Jupiter model, and help
us to better understand how the early Solar System evolved.

substantially different from that of a hot spot around a black hole, because
the photon capture sphere of the wormhole is much smaller. The radius of the

possible to generate highly-detailed genotypes inexpensively. The collection
and analysis of such data has the potential to support various applications,
including personalized medical services. While the benefits of the genomics
revolution are trumpeted by the biomedical community, the increased
availability of such data has major implications for personal privacy; notably
because the genome has certain essential features, which include (but are not
limited to) (i) an association with traits and certain diseases, (ii)
identification capability (e.g., forensics), and (iii) revelation of family
relationships. Moreover, direct-to-consumer DNA testing increases the
likelihood that genome data will be made available in less regulated
environments, such as the Internet and for-profit companies. The problem of
genome data privacy thus resides at the crossroads of computer science,
medicine, and public policy. While the computer scientists have addressed data
privacy for various data types, there has been less attention dedicated to
genomic data. Thus, the goal of this paper is to provide a systematization of
knowledge for the computer science community. In doing so, we address some of
the (sometimes erroneous) beliefs of this field and we report on a survey we
conducted about genome data privacy with biomedical specialists. Then, after
characterizing the genome privacy problem, we review the state-of-the-art
regarding privacy attacks on genomic data and strategies for mitigating such
attacks, as well as contextualizing these attacks from the perspective of
medicine and public policy. This paper concludes with an enumeration of the
challenges for genome data privacy and presents a framework to systematize the
analysis of threats and the design of countermeasures as the field moves
forward.

multi-gapped system like Fe-based materials we use two band model for
simplicity. The model comprises of spin density wave (SDW), orbital density
wave (ODW) arising due to nested pieces of the electron and hole like Fermi
surfaces; together with superconductivity of different pairing symmetries
around electron and hole like Fermi surfaces. We show that either only intra or
only inter band pairing is insufficient to describe some of the experimental
results like large to small gap ratio, thermal behaviour of electronic specific
heat jump etc. It is shown that the inter-band pairing is essential in Fe-based
materials having multiple gaps to produce a single global $T_c$. Some of our
results in this scenario, matches with the earlier published work
\cite{two-band-prb}, and also have differences. The origin of difference
between the two is also discussed. Combined intra-inter band pairing mechanism
produces the specific heat jump to superconducting transition temperature ratio
proportional to square of the transition temperature, both in the electron and
hole doped regime, for sign changing s$^{\pm}$ wave symmetry which takes the
d+s pairing symmetry form. Our work thus demonstrates the importance of
combined intra-inter band pairing irrespective of the pairing mechanism.

set of their center points. A hyperplane $\Hy$ is an \emph{$m$-separator} for
$\D$ if each closed halfspace bounded by $\Hy$ contains at least $m$ points
from $P$. This generalizes the notion of halving hyperplanes, which correspond
to $n/2$-separators. The analogous notion for point sets has been well studied.
Separators have various applications, for instance, in divide-and-conquer
schemes. In such a scheme any ball that is intersected by the separating
hyperplane may still interact with both sides of the partition. Therefore it is
desirable that the separating hyperplane intersects a small number of balls
only. We present three deterministic algorithms to bisect or approximately
bisect a given set of disjoint unit balls by a hyperplane: Firstly, we present
a simple linear-time algorithm to construct an $\alpha n$-separator for balls
in $\R^d$, for any $0<\alpha<1/2$, that intersects at most $cn^{(d-1)/d}$
balls, for some constant $c$ that depends on $d$ and $\alpha$. The number of
intersected balls is best possible up to the constant $c$. Secondly, we present
a near-linear time algorithm to construct an $(n/2-o(n))$-separator in $\R^d$
that intersects $o(n)$ balls. Finally, we give a linear-time algorithm to
construct a halving line in $\R^2$ that intersects $O(n^{(5/6)+\epsilon})$
disks.
  Our results improve the runtime of a disk sliding algorithm by Bereg,
Dumitrescu and Pach. In addition, our results improve and derandomize an
algorithm to construct a space decomposition used by L{\""o}ffler and Mulzer to
construct an onion (convex layer) decomposition for imprecise points (any point

new light on this long standing problem we present here a discussion based on
the use rigorous mathematical machinery of distributions combined with physical
concepts, such as causality, to show how to deal with these singular
propagators in a general fashion without making use of any prescription. The
first step of our development will consist in showing how analytic
representation for propagators arises by requiring general physical properties
in the framework of Wightman's formalism. From that we shall determine the
equal-time (anti)commutation relations in the light-front form for the scalar,
fermionic fields and for the dynamical components of the electromagnetic field.
In conclusion, we introduce the Epstein-Glaser causal method in order to have a
mathematical rigorous treatment of the free propagators of the theory, allowing
us to discuss the general treatment for propagators of the type $(k^{+})

the weighing current might effect the magnetization state of the permanent

to an error in the result if not accounted for. In this article a simple model
explaining the effect of the weighing current on the yoke of the magnet is

spintronics applications. In this work we consider the TAMR effect at the
single-atom limit by investigating the anisotropy of the local density of
states in the vacuum above transition-metal adatoms adsorbed on a noncollinear
magnetic surface, the monolayer of Mn on W(110). This surface presents a
cycloidal spin spiral ground state with an angle of 173$^\circ$ between
neighbouring spins and thus allows a quasi-continuous exploration of the
angular dependence of the TAMR of adsorbed adatoms using scanning tunnelling
microscopy. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the TAMR of Co,
Rh and Ir adatoms on Mn/W(110) and relate our results to magnetization
direction dependent changes in the local density of states. The anisotropic
effect is found to be enhanced dramatically on the adsorption of heavy

respect because they can provide insight into the origin of the very long life
time of puffs, and the dynamical mechanism leading to the transition from puffs
to slugs in pipe flow. The present paper contributes to this enterprise by
introducing a unidirectionally coupled map lattice. It mimics three of the

a partially ordered set whose elements are colored black or white, the players
Black and White take turns removing any maximal element of their own color. If
there is no such element, the player loses.
  We prove that pomax games are always integer-valued and for colored tree

initiated from the cell of the base station. On the other hand, a handover call
has been connecting to a base station and moves to another one. In order to
keep the continuation of the communication, it is desired that an available
channel in the new base station is immediately assigned to the handover call.
To this end, a channel is reserved as the guard channel for handover calls in
base stations. Blocked fresh and handover calls join a virtual orbit and repeat
their attempts in a later time. We assume that a base station can recognize
retrial calls and give them the same priority as that of handover calls. We
model a base station by a multiserver retrial queue with priority customers for
which a level-dependent QBD process is formulated. We obtain Taylor series
expansion for the nonzero elements of the rate matrices of the level-dependent
QBD. Using the expansion results, we obtain an asymptotic upper bound for the
joint stationary distribution of the number of busy channels and that of
customers in the orbit. Furthermore, we derive an efficient numerical algorithm

with the conservation law of mass. It shows that no potential energy is

done by the buoyancy force due to changes in temperature corresponds to the
conversion between kinetic and internal energy. This energy conversion,
however, makes only an ignorable contribution to the distribution of

  The Boussinesq approximation is, in physical oceanography, extended so that
the motion of seawater can be studied. This paper considers this extended
approximation as well. Under the extended approximation, the work done by the
buoyancy force due to changes in salinity corresponds to the conversion between
kinetic and potential energy. It also turns out that the conservation law of

corrections, to study twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) where Stone-Wales defects
or monovacancies are introduced in one of the layers. We compare these results
to those for defects in single layer graphene or Bernal stacked graphene. The
energetics of defect formation is not very sensitive to the stacking of the
layers or the specific site at which the defect is created, suggesting a weak
interlayer coupling. However signatures of the interlayer coupling are
manifested clearly in the electronic band structure. For the ""$\gamma\gamma$""
Stone Wales defect in TBLG, we observe two Dirac cones that are shifted in both
momentum space and energy. This up/down shift in energy results from the
combined effect of a charge transfer between the two graphene layers, and a
chemical interaction between the layers, which mimics the effects of a
transverse electric field. Charge density plots show that states near the Dirac
points have significant admixture between the two layers. For Stone Wales
defects at other sites in TBLG, this basic structure is modified by the
creation of mini gaps at energy crossings. For a monovacancy, the Dirac cone of
the pristine layer is shifted up in energy by $\sim0.25$ eV due to a
combination of the requirements of the equilibration of Fermi energy between
the two layers with different numbers of electrons, charge transfer, and
chemical interactions. Both kinds of defects increase the density of states at
the Fermi level. The monovacancy also results in spin polarization, with
magnetic moments on the defect of 1.2 - 1.8 $\mu_B$.

pumping of bilayer films. On the other hand, the voltage is of the same sign at

voltage greatly increases in magnitude. The observed voltage is unconventional;
neither its sign nor magnitude can be expected from spin pumping of bilayer

""mavericks"" -- unexpected solutions with odd properties, e.g., black holes with
scalar hair in theories with scalar potential bounded from below. Probably the
most famous example is Bocharova-Bronnikov-Melnikov-Bekenstein (BBMB) black
hole solution in a theory with a scalar field conformally coupled to the
gravity and with vanishing potential. Its existence naively violates no-hair
conjecture without violating no-hair theorems because of the singular behavior
of the scalar field at the horizon. Despite being discovered more than 40 years
ago, nature of BBMB solution is still the subject of research and debate. We
argue here that the key in understanding nature of maverick solutions is the
proper choice of field redefinition schemes in which the solutions are regular.
It appears that in such ""regular"" schemes mavericks have different physical
interpretations, in particular they are not elementary but composite objects.
For example, BBMB solution is not an extremal black hole but a collection of a
wormhole and a naked singularity. In the process we show that Weyl-invariant
formulation of gravity is a perfect tool for such analyzes.

oscillators (on the order of $100\;\mathrm{ns}$) allows us to study the scaling
of the transient time of large networks of more than a hundred nodes, which has
not yet been confirmed previously in an experiment and could potentially be
important in many natural networks. We find that the average transient time
increases exponentially with the network size and can be modeled as a Poisson
process in experiment and simulation. This exponential scaling is a result of a
synchronization rate that follows a power law of the phase-space volume.

propagating through the magnetic domain region. If the ferromagnetic layers on
both sides of magnetic domain have the same features, the long-range proximity
effect will take place. That is because the singlet Cooper pair will create an
exact phase-cancellation effect and gets an additional $\pi$ phase shift as it
passes through the entire ferromagnetic region. Then the equal spin triplet
pair only exists in the magnetic domain region and can not diffuse into the
other two ferromagnetic layers. So the supercurrent mostly arises from the
singlet Cooper pairs and the equal spin triplet pairs are not involved. This
behavior is quite distinct from the common knowledge that long-range
supercurrent induced by inhomogeneous ferromagnetism stems from the equal spin
triplet pairs. The result we presented here provides a new way for generating

after inflation. With the assignment of the baryon number to the inflaton, the
baryon asymmetry of the universe is produced by inflaton's decay. In addition
to this, the $U(1)$ breaking term modulates the curvature of the inflaton
radial direction depending on its phase, which affects the tensor to scalar
ratio. In this paper, we have studied the relation between the baryon asymmetry
and the tensor to scalar ratio, then verified that the future CMB observation
could test this baryogenesis scenario with large tensor mode.

the first paper of this series, a surprisingly large fraction of optical light
was found to be resolved in the 89 Her post-AGB system. The data showed this
flux to arise from close to the central binary. Scattering off the inner rim of
the circumbinary disk, or in a dusty outflow were suggested as two possible
origins. With detailed dust radiative transfer models of the disk we aim to
discriminate between these two configurations. By including Herschel/SPIRE
photometry, we extend the SED such that it now fully covers UV to sub-mm
wavelengths. The MCMax radiative transfer code is used to create a large grid
of disk models. Our models include a self-consistent treatment of dust settling
as well as of scattering. A Si-rich composition with two additional opacity
sources, metallic Fe or amorphous C, are tested. The SED is fit together with
mid-IR (MIDI) visibilities as well as the optical and near-IR visibilities of
Paper I, to constrain the structure of the disk and in particular of its inner
rim. The near-IR visibility data require a smooth inner rim, here obtained with
a two-power-law parameterization of the radial surface density distribution. A
model can be found that fits all the IR photometric and interferometric data
well, with either of the two continuum opacity sources. Our best-fit passive
models are characterized by a significant amount of mm-sized grains, which are
settled to the midplane of the disk. Not a single disk model fits our data at
optical wavelengths though, the reason being the opposing constraints imposed
by the optical and near-IR interferometric data. A geometry in which a passive,
dusty, and puffed-up circumbinary disk is present, can reproduce all the IR but
not the optical observations of 89 Her. Another dusty, outflow or halo,
component therefore needs to be added to the system.

operationalist, or a combination of the two. In this paper a realistic theory
is defined as describing a closed system entirely by means of entities and
concepts pertaining to the system. An operationalist theory, on the other hand,
requires in addition entities external to the system. A realistic formulation
comprises an ontology, the set of (mathematical) entities that describe the
system, and assertions, the set of correct statements (predictions) the theory
makes about the objects in the ontology. Classical mechanics is the prime
example of a realistic physical theory. The present realistic formulation of
the histories approach originally introduced by Griffiths, which we call
'Compatible Quantum Theory (CQT)', consists of a 'microscopic' part (MIQM),
which applies to a closed quantum system of any size, and a 'macroscopic' part
(MAQM), which requires the participation of a large (ideally, an infinite)
system. The first (MIQM) can be fully formulated based solely on the assumption
of a Hilbert space ontology and the noncontextuality of probability values,
relying in an essential way on Gleason's theorem and on an application to
dynamics due in large part to Nistico. The microscopic theory does not,
however, possess a unique corpus of assertions, but rather a multiplicity of
contextual truths ('c-truths'), each one associated with a different framework.
This circumstance leads us to consider the microscopic theory to be physically
indeterminate and therefore incomplete, though logically coherent. The
completion of the theory requires a macroscopic mechanism for selecting a
physical framework, which is part of the macroscopic theory (MAQM). Detailed
definitions and proofs are presented in the appendices

Smart Grid infrastructures, especially tailored to reduce the peak demand of
residential users. In particular, we use a dynamic pricing strategy, where
energy tariffs are function of the overall power demand of customers. We
consider two practical cases: (1) a fully distributed approach, where each
appliance decides autonomously its own scheduling, and (2) a hybrid approach,
where each user must schedule all his appliances. We analyze numerically these
two approaches, showing that they are characterized practically by the same
performance level in all the considered grid scenarios. We model the proposed
system using a non-cooperative game theoretical approach, and demonstrate that
our game is a generalized ordinal potential one under general conditions.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective best response strategy that is
proved to converge in a few steps to a pure Nash Equilibrium, thus
demonstrating the robustness of the power scheduling plan obtained without any
central coordination of the operator or the customers. Numerical results,
obtained using real load profiles and appliance models, show that the
system-wide peak absorption achieved in a completely distributed fashion can be
reduced up to 55%, thus decreasing the capital expenditure (CAPEX) necessary to
meet the growing energy demand.

This low resolution, low contrast image without noise is decomposed into four
sub-bands by using DWT and SWT. The resolution enhancement technique is based
on the interpolation of high frequency components obtained by DWT and input
image. SWT is used to enhance input image. DWT is used to decompose an image
into four frequency sub bands and these four sub-bands are interpolated using
bicubic interpolation technique. All these sub-bands are reconstructed as high
resolution image by using inverse DWT (IDWT). To increase the contrast the
proposed technique uses DWT and SVD. GHE is used to equalize an image. The
equalized image is decomposed into four sub-bands using DWT and new LL sub-band
is reconstructed using SVD. All sub-bands are reconstructed using IDWT to
generate high resolution and contrast image over conventional techniques. The
experimental result shows superiority of the proposed technique over

gluons and spin-1/2 quarks to unconstrained colorless spin-0, spin-1, spin-2
and spin-3 glueball fields and colorless Rarita-Schwinger fields. The obtained
physical Hamiltonian naturally admits a systematic strong-coupling expansion in
powers of \lambda=g^{-2/3}, equivalent to an expansion in the number of spatial
derivatives. The leading-order term corresponds to non-interacting
hybrid-glueballs, whose low-lying spectrum can be calculated with high accuracy
by solving the Schr\""odinger-equation of the Dirac-Yang-Mills quantum mechanics
of spatially constant fields (at the moment only for the 2-color case). The
discrete glueball excitation spectrum shows a universal string-like behaviour
with practically all excitation energy going in to the increase of the
strengths of merely two fields, the ""constant Abelian fields"" corresponding to
the zero-energy valleys of the chromomagnetic potential. Inclusion of the
fermionic degrees of freedom significantly lowers the spectrum and allows for
the study of the sigma meson. Higher-order terms in \lambda lead to
interactions between the hybrid-glueballs and can be taken into account
systematically using perturbation theory, allowing for the study of
IR-renormalisation and Lorentz invariance. The existence of the generalized
polar decomposition used, the position of the zeros of the corresponding
Jacobian (Gribov horizons), and the ranges of the physical variables can be
investigated by solving a system of algebraic equations. It is exactly solvable
for 1 spatial dimension and several numerical solutions can be found for 2 and

capabilities afforded by optical interferometers. The intersection of two
developments in astronomy enable direct imaging of exoplanet transits: first,
improvements in sensitivity and precision of interferometric instrumentation;
and second, identification of ever-brighter host stars. Efforts are underway
for the first direct high-precision detection of closure phase signatures with
the CHARA Array and Navy Precision Optical Interferometer. When successful,
these measurements will enable recovery of the transit position angle on the
sky, along with characterization of other system parameters, such as stellar
radius, planet radius, and other parameters of the transit event. This
technique can directly determine the planet's radius independent of any outside
observations, and appears able to improve substantially upon other
determinations of that radius; it will be possible to extract wavelength
dependence of that radius determination, for connection to characterization of
planetary atmospheric composition & structure. Additional directly observed
parameters - also not dependent on transit photometry or spectroscopy - include
impact parameter, transit ingress time, and transit velocity.

systems with only rocky planets should be the most common in the Universe. We
study the diversity of planetary systems that might form around Sun-like stars
in low-mass disks without giant planets. We focus on the formation process of
terrestrial planets in the habitable zone (HZ) and analyze their water contents
with the goal to determine systems of astrobiological interest. Besides, we
study the formation of planets on wide orbits because they can be detected with
the microlensing technique. N-body simulations of high resolution (embryos +
planetesimals) are developed for a wide range of surface density profiles. The
surface density profile combines a power law to the inside of the disk of the
form r^{-gamma}, with an exponential decay to the outside. We adopt a disk of
0.03M_sun and values of gamma = 0.5, 1 and 1.5. All our simulations form
planets in the HZ with different masses and final water contents depending on
the 3 profiles. For gamma = 0.5, we produce 3 planets in the HZ with masses
between 0.03 M_e to 0.1 M_e and water contents between 0.2 and 16 Earth oceans.
For gamma = 1, 3 planets form in the HZ with masses between 0.18 M_e and 0.52
M_e and water contents from 34 to 167 Earth oceans. For gamma = 1.5, we find 4
planets in the HZ with masses from 0.66 M_e to 2.21 M_e and water contents
between 192 and 2326 Earth oceans. This profile shows distinctive results
because it is the only one of those studied here that leads to the formation of
water worlds. Since planetary systems with gamma = 1 and 1.5 present planets in
the HZ with suitable masses to retain a long-live atmosphere and to maintain
plate tectonics, they seem to be the most outstanding candidates to be
potentially habitable. Particularly, these systems form Earths and Super-Earths
near the snow line which can be discovered by microlensing.

are critical in the discovery of very low surface brightness supernova remnants
(SNRs), which may constitute a significant portion of the Galactic SNRs still
unaccounted for (ostensibly the Missing SNR problem). The overall purpose here
is to present the results of a systematic, deep data-mining of the Canadian
Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS) for faint, extended non-thermal and polarized
emission structures that are likely the shells of uncatalogued supernova
remnants. We examine 5$\times$5 degree mosaics from the entire 1420 MHz
continuum and polarization dataset of the CGPS after removing unresolved point
sources and subsequently smoothing them. Newly revealed extended emission
objects are compared to similarly-prepared CGPS 408 MHz continuum mosaics, as
well as to source-removed mosaics from various existing radio surveys at 4.8
GHz, 2.7 GHz, and 327 MHz, to identify candidates with non-thermal emission
characteristics. We integrate flux densities at each frequency to characterise
the radio spectra behaviour of these candidates. We further look for mid- and
high-frequency (1420 MHz, 4.8 GHz) ordered polarized emission from the limb
brightened shell-like continuum features that the candidates sport. Finally, we
use IR and optical maps to provide additional backing evidence. Here we present
evidence that five new objects, identified as filling all or some of the
criteria above, are strong candidates for new SNRs. These five are designated
by their Galactic coordinate names G108.5+11.0, G128.5+2.6, G149.5+3.2,
G150.8+3.8, and G160.1$-$1.1. These discoveries represent a significant
increase in the number of SNRs known in the outer Galaxy second quadrant of
longitude (90$^{\circ} \leq \ell \leq $180$^{\circ}$).

that are imposed by the problem. We show how to accomplish this influence for
gates in adiabatic quantum computing, particularly the controlled-NOT gate
(CNOT gate) which is fundamental to all quantum gates on two or more qubits. In
addition, we adapt the Toffoli gate, the Fredkin gate, and the Hadamard gate to
the Ising objective function which is a foundation for discrete optimization on
D-Wave System machines. The quantum work in this paper encompasses Boolean
operations, some of which are used to construct gates. We think the possible
advantages of the building blocks in this paper will enhance quantum algorithms

subjective rather than classical probability. In Experiment 2 we examine the
conjunction fallacy and demonstrate that the materials used by Tversky and
