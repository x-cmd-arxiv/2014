prime end boundary of a bounded domain in a complete metric measure space
equipped with a doubling measure supporting a Poincare inequality. We show the
resolutivity of functions that are continuous on the prime end boundary and are
Lipschitz regular when restricted to the subset of all prime ends whose
impressions are singleton sets. We also consider a new notion of capacity
adapted to the prime end boundary, and show that bounded perturbations of such
functions on subsets of the prime end boundary with zero capacity are
resolutive and that their Perron solutions coincide with the Perron solution of
the original functions. We also describe some examples which demonstrate the
efficacy of the prime end boundary approach in obtaining new results even for
the classical Dirichlet problem for some Euclidean domains.

realized semivariances of petroleum commodities: crude oil, gasoline, and
heating oil. During the 1987--2014 period we document increasing spillovers
from volatility among petroleum commodities that substantially change after the
2008 financial crisis. The increase in volatility spillovers correlates with
the progressive financialization of the commodities. In terms of asymmetries in
spillovers we show that periods of increasing crude oil prices strongly
correlate with dominating spillovers due to bad volatility. Overall, bad
volatility due to negative returns spills over among petroleum commodities to a
much larger extent than good volatility due to positive returns. After the 2008
financial crisis the asymmetries in spillovers markedly declined in terms of
total as well as directional spillovers. An analysis of directional spillovers
further reveals that no commodity dominates other commodities in terms of
spillover transmission in general.

quasar spectra binned by black hole mass and redshift to assess galaxy features

hole mass is calculated using the photoionization method, and the host galaxy
luminosity is inferred from the depth of the Ca II H + K features in the

by examining the redshift dependence of Delta log M_bh, the offset in black
hole mass from the local black hole - bulge relationship. There is little
systematic trend in Delta log M_bh out to z = 0.8. Using the width of the [O
III] emission line as a proxy for the stellar velocity dispersion, sigma_*, we
find agreement of our derived host luminosities with the locally-observed
Faber-Jackson relation. This supports the utility of the width of the [O III]

  Budget-Feasible Mechanism for Large Markets","Accepted to FOCS 2014",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we consider a mechanism design problem in the context of
large-scale crowdsourcing markets such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk,
ClickWorker, CrowdFlower. In these markets, there is a requester who wants to
hire workers to accomplish some tasks. Each worker is assumed to give some
utility to the requester. Moreover each worker has a minimum cost that he wants
to get paid for getting hired. This minimum cost is assumed to be private
information of the workers. The question then is - if the requester has a
limited budget, how to design a direct revelation mechanism that picks the
right set of workers to hire in order to maximize the requester's utility.
  We note that although the previous work has studied this problem, a crucial
difference in which we deviate from earlier work is the notion of large-scale
markets that we introduce in our model. Without the large market assumption, it
is known that no mechanism can achieve an approximation factor better than
0.414 and 0.5 for deterministic and randomized mechanisms respectively (while
the best known deterministic and randomized mechanisms achieve an approximation
ratio of 0.292 and 0.33 respectively). In this paper, we design a
budget-feasible mechanism for large markets that achieves an approximation
factor of 1-1/e (i.e. almost 0.63). Our mechanism can be seen as a
generalization of an alternate way to look at the proportional share mechanism
which is used in all the previous works so far on this problem. Interestingly,
we also show that our mechanism is optimal by showing that no truthful
mechanism can achieve a factor better than 1-1/e; thus, fully resolving this
setting. Finally we consider the more general case of submodular utility
functions and give new and improved mechanisms for the case when the markets
are large.

constraining edge and other subgraph densities comes from Radin and Sadun. Such
modeling circumvents a phenomenon first made precise by Chatterjee and
Diaconis: that in ERGMs it is often impossible to independently constrain edge

either uniform or bipodal structure. When edge density (resp. $p$-star density)
is fixed and $p$-star density (resp. edge density) is controlled by a
parameter, we find phase transitions corresponding to a change from uniform to

of two types: two-photon exchange (TPE) and bremsstrahlung (BS); in the present
work we pay special attention to the latter. Assuming small missing energy or
missing mass cut-off, the correction can be represented in a model-independent
form, with both electron and proton radiation taken into account. Numerical
calculations show that the contribution of the proton radiation is not
negligible. Overall, at high $Q^2$ and energies the total correction to $\mu
G_E/G_M$ grows, but is dominated by TPE. At low energies both TPE and BS may be
significant; the latter amounts to ~ 0.01 for some reasonable cut-off choices.

$\mathbb{T}$-equivariant versions of celebrated results of Kirchberg: any
Rokhlin action on a separable, nuclear C*-algebra is $KK^\mathbb{T}$-equivalent
to a Rokhlin action on a Kirchberg algebra; any Rokhlin action on an exact
separable C*-algebra embeds equivariantly into $\mathcal{O}_2$ (with its unique

  In the presence of the UCT, $KK^\mathbb{T}$-equivalence for Rokhlin actions
reduces to isomorphism of a $K$-theoretical invariant, namely of a canonical
pure extension naturally associated to any Rokhlin action, and we provide a
complete description of the extensions that arise from actions on nuclear

as orbits of a family of one parameter, smooth, orientation preserving and
nonsingular diffeomorphisms on a compact and smooth-boundary domain in the
Euclidian 3-space which necessarily preserve a finite measure, later
interpreted as the fluid mass. Under such diffeomorphisms the Biot-Savart
helicity of the pushforward of a divergence-free and tangent to the boundary
vector field is proved to be conserved and since these circumstances present an
isentropic flow, the conservation of the ""Biot-Savart helicity"" is established
for such flows. On the other hand, the well known helicity conservation in
ideal flows which here we call it ""physical helicity"" is found to be an
independent constant with respect to the Biot-Savart helicity. The difference
between these two helicities reflects some topological features of the domain
as well as the velocity and vorticity fields which is discussed and is shown
for simply connected domains the two helicities coincide. The energy variation
of the vorticity field is shown to be formally the same as for the
incompressible flow obtained before. For fluid domains consisting of several
disjoint solid tori, at each time, the harmonic knot subspace of smooth vector
fields on the fluid domain is found to have two independent base sets with a
special type of orthogonality between these two bases by which a topological
description of the vortex and velocity fields depending on the helicity
difference is achieved since this difference is shown to depend only on the
harmonic knot parts of velocity, vorticity and its Biot-Savart vector field.
For an ideal MHD flow three independent constant helicities are reviewed while
the helicity of magnetic potential is generalized for non-simply connected
domains by inserting a special harmonic knot field in the dynamics of the
magnetic potential.

  with Externalities",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sponsored search auctions constitute one of the most successful applications
of microeconomic mechanisms. In mechanism design, auctions are usually designed
to incentivize advertisers to bid their truthful valuations and to assure both
the advertisers and the auctioneer a non-negative utility. Nonetheless, in
sponsored search auctions, the click-through-rates (CTRs) of the advertisers
are often unknown to the auctioneer and thus standard truthful mechanisms
cannot be directly applied and must be paired with an effective learning
algorithm for the estimation of the CTRs. This introduces the critical problem
of designing a learning mechanism able to estimate the CTRs at the same time as
implementing a truthful mechanism with a revenue loss as small as possible
compared to an optimal mechanism designed with the true CTRs. Previous work
showed that, when dominant-strategy truthfulness is adopted, in single-slot
auctions the problem can be solved using suitable exploration-exploitation
mechanisms able to achieve a per-step regret (over the auctioneer's revenue) of
order $O(T^{-1/3})$ (where T is the number of times the auction is repeated).
It is also known that, when truthfulness in expectation is adopted, a per-step
regret (over the social welfare) of order $O(T^{-1/2})$ can be obtained. In
this paper we extend the results known in the literature to the case of
multi-slot auctions. In this case, a model of the user is needed to
characterize how the advertisers' valuations change over the slots. We adopt
the cascade model that is the most famous model in the literature for sponsored
search auctions. We prove a number of novel upper bounds and lower bounds both
on the auctioneer's revenue loss and social welfare w.r.t. to the VCG auction
and we report numerical simulations investigating the accuracy of the bounds in
predicting the dependency of the regret on the auction parameters.

called ""sensitive dependence on initial conditions"". Although Hamilton's
equations are thoroughly time-reversible, the forward and backward Lyapunov
instabilities can differ, qualitatively. In numerical work, the expected
forward/backward pairing of Lyapunov exponents is also occasionally violated.
To illustrate, we consider many-body inelastic collisions in two space
dimensions. Two mirror-image colliding crystallites can either bounce, or not,
giving rise to a single liquid drop, or to several smaller droplets, depending
upon the initial kinetic energy and the interparticle forces. The difference
between the forward and backward evolutionary instabilities of these problems
can be correlated with dissipation and with the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
Accordingly, these asymmetric stabilities of Hamilton's equations can provide
an ""Arrow of Time"". We illustrate these facts for two small crystallites
colliding so as to make a warm liquid. We use a specially-symmetrized form of
Levesque and Verlet's bit-reversible Leapfrog integrator. We analyze

science curriculum has undergone many revisions, analysis, and discussion.
Unfortunately, the graduate level curriculum is lagging far behind in computer
science education literature and research. To remedy this, we present the
blueprint and execution of a graduate level course in programming, designed
specifically to cater to the needs of graduate students with a diverse
background both in CS and other fields. To this end, the course is divided into
two halves. In the first half, students are introduced to different programming
concepts, such as multi-paradigm programming, data structures, concurrency, and
security to bring them up to speed and provide a level playing field. In the
second half, all of these concepts are employed as building blocks to solve
real-world problems from data mining, natural language processing, computer
vision, and other fields. In addition, the paper also discusses in detail the
evaluation instruments employed for the course. Moreover, we also share
anecdotal information around student feedback, course design, and grading that
may be useful for others who wish to replicate our curriculum or sketch a

utility of long term rate maximization with long term rate quality of service
(QoS) constraints, and global outage probability minimization with outage QoS
constraints. The first problem is well-suited for low mobility environments,
while the second problem provides a framework to deal with environments with
fast fading. The defined optimization problems in this paper are solved in two
phases: cell association phase followed by the optional RB distribution phase.
We show that the cell association phase of both problems have the same
structure. Based on this similarity, we propose a unified distributed algorithm
with low levels of message passing to for the cell association phase. This
distributed algorithm is derived by relaxing the association constraints and
using Lagrange dual decomposition method. In the RB distribution phase, the
remaining RBs after the cell association phase are distributed among the users.

also found that electronic conductance in both AGNR and zigzag graphene
nanoribbons (ZGNRs) oscillates with Rashba spin-orbit coupling akin to the

Furthermore, the local density of states (LDOS) shows that depending on the
smoothness of the staggered potential, the edge state of AGNR can either emerge

accepted to be 19.47 degrees, recent observations and calculations for
sufficiently fast-moving ships suggest that the apparent wake angle decreases
with ship speed. One explanation for this decrease in angle relies on the
assumption that a ship cannot generate wavelengths much greater than its hull
length. An alternative interpretation is that the wave pattern that is observed
in practice is defined by the location of the highest peaks; for wakes created
by sufficiently fast-moving objects, these highest peaks no longer lie on the
outermost divergent waves, resulting in a smaller apparent angle. In this
paper, we focus on the problems of free surface flow past a single submerged
point source and past a submerged source doublet. In the linear version of
these problems, we measure the apparent wake angle formed by the highest peaks,
and observe the following three regimes: a small Froude number pattern, in
which the divergent waves are not visible; standard wave patterns for which the
maximum peaks occur on the outermost divergent waves; and a third regime in
which the highest peaks form a V-shape with an angle much less than the Kelvin
angle. For nonlinear flows, we demonstrate that nonlinearity has the effect of
increasing the apparent wake angle so that some highly nonlinear solutions have
apparent wake angles that are greater than Kelvin's angle. For large Froude
numbers, the effect on apparent wake angle can be more dramatic, with the
possibility of strong nonlinearity shifting the wave pattern from the third
regime to the second. We expect our nonlinear results will translate to other
more complicated flow configurations, such as flow due to a steadily moving
closed body such as a submarine.

voids of the rather open cubic structure of bulk Cu3N build up a magnetic
structure. In an extended effort to study this system, we have investigated
spin polarization in bulk and thin films of nitrogen intercalated Cu3N (Cu3N2)
structure by means of first-principles calculations based on Kohn-Sham density
functional theory and ultrasoft pseudopotentials technique. Contrary to the
previous study, the results show that after an accurate structural relaxation
of the system, magnetism in the bulk structure vanishes. This effect is due to
the migration of the intercalated nitrogen atom from the body center of the
cell to the nearness of one of the cell faces. Similar study for the thin films
of 5, 7, 9 and 11 monolayers thickness was performed and it was found that
initial relaxation of structures with 7 and 11 monolayers show a net magnetic
moment of 2.6 {\mu}B. By a more extended survey of the energy surfaces, the
film with 7 monolayers loses its magnetic moment similar to the bulk structure
but the film with 11 monolayers maintains its magnetic moment. It is possibly a
new quantum size effect that keeps the intercalated nitrogen atom of the
middlemost cell at the body center site. Electron density map of this film
clearly confirms the spin polarization upon the intercalated atom.

computing (HPC) systems has attracted a great deal of attention. In response to
this, many energy-aware algorithms have been developed in different layers of
HPC systems, including the hardware layer, service layer and system layer.
These algorithms are of two types: first, algorithms which directly try to
improve the energy by tweaking frequency operation or scheduling algorithms;
and second, algorithms which focus on improving the performance of the system,
with the assumption that efficient running of a system may indirectly save more
energy.
  In this thesis, we develop algorithms in both layers. First, we introduce
three algorithms to directly improve the energy of scheduled tasks at the
hardware level by using Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS). Second, we
propose two algorithms for modelling and resource provisioning of MapReduce
applications (a well-known parametric distributed framework currently used by
Google, Yahoo, Facebook and LinkedIn) based on its configuration parameters.
Certainly, estimating the performance (e.g., execution time or CPU clock ticks)
of a MapReduce application can be later used for smart scheduling of such
applications in clouds or clusters.
  To evaluate the algorithms, we have conducted extensive simulation and real
experiments on a 5-node physical cluster with up to 25 virtual nodes, using
both synthetic and real world applications. Also, the proposed new algorithms
are compared with existing algorithms by experimentation, and the experimental
results reveal new information on the performance of these algorithms, as well
as on the properties of MapReduce and DVFS. In the end, three open problems are
revealed by the experimental observations, and their importance is explained.

This paper presents a systematic design methodology for BMST systems to
approach the channel capacity at any given target bit-error-rate (BER) of
interest. To simplify the design, we choose the basic code as the Cartesian
product of a short block code. The encoding memory is then inferred from the
genie-aided lower bound according to the performance gap of the short block
code to the corresponding Shannon limit at the target BER. In addition to the
sliding-window decoding algorithm, we propose to perform one more phase
decoding to remove residual (rare) errors. A new technique that assumes a noisy
genie is proposed to upper bound the performance. Under some mild assumptions,
these genie-aided bounds can be used to predict the performance of the proposed
two-phase decoding algorithm in the extremely low BER region. Using the
Cartesian product of a repetition code as the basic code, we construct a BMST
system with an encoding memory 30 whose performance at the BER of $10^{-15}$
can be predicted within one dB away from the Shannon limit over the
binary-input additive white Gaussian noise channel (BI-AWGNC).

natural generalization of $M$-estimators of scatter matrix (Maronna, 1976) and
are defined as a solution to a penalized $M$-estimation cost function that
depend on a pair $(\alpha,\beta)$ of regularization parameters. We derive
general conditions for uniqueness of the solution using concept of geodesic
convexity. Since these conditions do not include Tyler's $M$-estimator,
necessary and sufficient conditions for uniqueness of the penalized Tyler's
cost function are established separately. For the regularized Tyler's
$M$-estimator, we also derive a simple, closed form and data dependent solution
for choosing the regularization parameter based on shape matrix matching in the
mean squared sense. An iterative algorithm that converges to the solution of
the regularized $M$-estimating equation is also provided. Finally, some
simulations studies illustrate the improved accuracy of the proposed
regularized $M$-estimators of scatter compared to their non-regularized
counterparts in low sample support problems. An example of radar detection
using normalized matched filter (NMF) illustrate that an adaptive NMF detector
based on regularized $M$-estimators are able to maintain accurately the preset
CFAR level and at at the same time provide similar probability of detection as
the (theoretical) NMF detector.

there is a polynomial-time algorithm that, given values $L$ and $T$, and an
instance having a sufficiently large feasibility factor $h \in (0,1]$, either
proves that no schedule of mean machine completion time $L$ and makespan $T$

confirm an asymmetry previously observed at larger distances from the star and
at shorter wavelengths: the isophotes are more widely spaced on the north-west

interpreted as a small inclination of the disc combined with anisotropic
scattering. Our best-fit model has an inclination of 86 degrees with an
anisotropic Henyey- Greenstein coefficient of 0.36. This interpretation is
supported by a new asymmetry detected in the disc: the disc is significantly

detect a possible new asymmetry within 1"", but at this stage we cannot discern

This action proved to be very useful (see e.g. [HC63, HC65, Sha74, Bar03]).
  Over non-Archimedean local fields, one can replace this action by the action
of the Bernstein center z of G, i.e. the center of the category of smooth
representations. However, this action is not well studied. In this paper we
provide some tools to work with this action and prove the following results.
  1) The wave-front set of any z-finite distribution on G over any point $g\in
G$ lies inside the nilpotent cone of $T_g^*G \cong \mathfrak{g}$.
  2) Let $H_1,H_2 \subset G$ be symmetric subgroups. Consider the space J of
$H_1\times H_2$-invariant distributions on G. We prove that the z-finite
distributions in J form a dense subspace. In fact we prove this result in wider
generality, where the groups $H_i$ are spherical groups of certain type and the
invariance condition is replaced by equivariance. Further we apply those
results to density and regularity of spherical characters.
  The first result can be viewed as a version of Howe's expansion of
characters. The second result can be viewed as a spherical space analog of a
classical theorem on density of characters of admissible representations. It
can also be viewed as a spectral version of Bernstein's localization principle.

remains open.

approaches the horizon (when backreaction of the field on geometry is
neglected). Rotation destroys this phenomenon. The angular momentum and radius
of ISCO look model-independent in the main approximation. We also study the
collisions between two particles that results in the ultra-high energy

factor as the standard Friedmann equations, including an accelerating de Sitter
universe. Though counter intuitive at first sight, gravity may drive cosmic
acceleration.
