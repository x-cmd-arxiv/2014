identified using LASCO and EIT images and their height-time diagrams. Their
interacting time and height are obtained, and their associated activities, such
as, flares and solar energetic particles (>10pfu) are also investigated.
Results from the analysis are: primary CMEs are much faster than the pre-CMEs,
their X-ray flares are also stronger (X and M class) compared to the flares (C
and M class) of pre-CMEs. Most of the events occurred during the period
2000-2006. From the observed width and speed of pre and primary CMEs, the
pre-CMEs are found to be less energetic than the primary CMEs. While the
primary CMEs are tracked up to the end of LASCO field of view, most of the
pre-CMEs are tracked up to < 26Rs. The SEP intensity is found to be related
with the integrated flux of the X-ray flares associated with the primary CMEs

layer at 310 km in Sept. 2011 at mid-northern latitudes. Through the inversion
of the transmission spectra with a line-by-line radiative transfer code we
retrieve the vertical distribution of CH$_4$ and CO mixing ratio. The two
methane bands at 1.4 and 1.7 {\mu}m are always in good agreement and yield an
average stratospheric abundance of $1.28\pm0.08$%. This is significantly less
than the value of 1.48% obtained by the GCMS/Huygens instrument. The analysis
of the residual spectra after the inversion shows that there are additional
absorptions which affect a great part of the VIMS wavelength range. We
attribute many of these additional bands to gaseous ethane, whose near-infrared
spectrum is not well modeled yet. Ethane contributes significantly to the
strong absorption between 3.2-3.5 {\mu}m that was previously attributed only to
C-H stretching bands from aerosols. Ethane bands may affect the surface windows
too, especially at 2.7 {\mu}m. Other residual bands are generated by stretching
modes of C-H, C-C and C-N bonds. In addition to the C-H stretch from aliphatic
hydrocarbons at 3.4 {\mu}m, we detect a strong and narrow absorption at 3.28
{\mu}m which we tentatively attribute to the presence of PAHs in the
stratosphere. C-C and C-N stretching bands are possibly present between 4.3-4.5

network modeling method with the employment of newly derived formulae. Two
relations describing the mechanical interaction between the local pressure and
local cross sectional area in distensible tubes of elastic nature are
considered in the derivation of these formulae. The model can be used to
describe shear dependent flows of mainly viscous nature. The behavior of the
proposed model is vindicated by several tests in a number of special and
limiting cases where the results can be verified quantitatively or
qualitatively. The model, which is the first of its kind, incorporates more
than one major non-linearity corresponding to the fluid rheology and conduit
mechanical properties, that is non-Newtonian effects and tube distensibility.
The formulation, implementation and performance indicate that the model enjoys
certain advantages over the existing models such as being exact within the
restricting assumptions on which the model is based, easy implementation, low
computational costs, reliability and smooth convergence. The proposed model can
therefore be used as an alternative to the existing Newtonian distensible
models; moreover it stretches the capabilities of the existing modeling
approaches to reach non-Newtonian rheologies.

microworlds, where students could experience a variety of laws of motion, from
Aristotle to Newton and Einstein or even new laws invented by the students
themselves. While often mistakenly seen as a game, Second Life (SL), the online
3-D virtual world hosted by Linden Lab, imposes essentially no rules on the
residents beyond reasonable restrictions on improper behavior and the physical
rules that guarantee its similitude to the real world. As a consequence, SL
qualifies itself as an environment for personal discovery and exploration as
proposed by constructivist theories. The physical laws are implemented through
the well-known physics engine Havok, whose design aims to provide game-players
a consistent, realistic environment. The Havok User Guide (2008) explicitly
encourages developers to use several tricks to cheat the simulator in order to
make games funnier or easier to play. As it is shown in this study, SL physics
is unexpectedly neither the Newtonian idealized physics nor a real world
physics virtualization, intentionally diverging from reality in such a way that
it could be called hyper-real. As a matter of fact, if some of its features
make objects behave more realistically than real ones, certain quantities like
energy have a totally different meaning in SL as compared to physics. Far from
considering it as a problem, however, the author argues that its hyper-reality
may be a golden teaching opportunity, allowing surreal physics simulations and
epistemologically rich classroom discussions around the what is a physical law?

component, viz. size estimation. Recent studies have shown that size is the
principal determinant of cost, and therefore an accurate size estimate is
crucial to good cost estimation. Improving the accuracy of size estimates is,
therefore, instrumental in improving the accuracy of cost and schedule
estimates. Moreover, software size and cost estimates have the highest utility
at the time of project inception, when most important decisions (e.g. budget
allocation, personnel allocation, etc). are taken. The dilemma, however, is
that only high-level requirements for a project are available at this stage.
Leveraging this high-level information to produce an accurate estimate of
software size is an extremely challenging and high risk task. This study
acknowledges the presence and effect of risk in any software estimate and
offers pragmatic strategies for risk mitigation.

different from those of the nebular gas from which the solar system formed, and
also differ from most of cometary values. Terrestrial N and H isotopic
compositions are in the range of values characterizing primitive meteorites,
which suggests that water, nitrogen, and other volatile elements on Earth
originated from a cosmochemical reservoir that also sourced the parent bodies
of primitive meteorites. Remnants of the proto-solar nebula (PSN) are still
present in the mantle, presumably signing the sequestration of PSN gas at an
early stage of planetary growth. The contribution of cometary volatiles appears
limited to a few percents at most of the total volatile inventory of the Earth.
The isotope signatures of H, N, Ne and Ar can be explained by mixing between
two end-members of solar and chondritic compositions, respectively, and do not
require isotopic fractionation during hydrodynamic escape of an early
atmosphere. The terrestrial inventory of 40Ar (produced by the decay of 40K
throughout the Earth's history) suggests that a significant fraction of
radiogenic argon may be still trapped in the silicate Earth. By normalizing
other volatile element abundances to this isotope, it is proposed that the
Earth is not as volatile-poor as previously thought. Our planet may indeed
contain up to ~3000 ppm water (preferred range : 1000-3000 ppm), and up to ~500
ppm C, both largely sequestrated in the solid Earth. This volatile content is
equivalent to a ~2 (+/-1) % contribution of carbonaceous chondrite (CI-CM)
material to a dry proto-Earth, which is higher than the contribution of
chondritic material advocated to account for the platinum group element budget
of the mantle. Such a (relatively) high contribution of volatile-rich matter is
consistent with the accretion of a few wet planetesimals during Earth
accretion.

pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) could occur in the local Universe, at
metallicities below Z_Sun/3. Previous PISN models were mostly produced at very
low metallicities in the context of the early Universe. We present new PISNe
models at a metallicity of Z=0.001, which are relevant for the local Universe.
We take the self-consistent stellar evolutionary models of pair-instability
progenitors with initial masses of 150 and 250 solar masses at metallicity of
Z=0.001 by Langer et al. (2007) and follow the evolution of these models
through the supernova explosions, using a hydrodynamics stellar evolution code
with an extensive nuclear network including 200 isotopes. Both models explode
as PISNe without leaving a compact stellar remnant. Our models produce a
nucleosynthetic pattern that is generally similar to that of Population III
PISN models, which is mainly characterized by the production of large amounts
of alpha-elements and a strong deficiency of the odd-charged elements. However,
the odd-even effect in our models is significantly weaker than that found in
Population III models. The comparison with the nucleosynthetic yields from
core-collapse supernovae at a similar metallicity (Z=0.002) indicates that
PISNe could have strongly influenced the chemical evolution below Z=0.002,
assuming a standard initial mass function. The odd-even effect is predicted to
be most prominent for the intermediate mass elements between silicon and
calcium. With future observations of chemical abundances in Population II
stars, our result can be used to constrain the number of PISNe that occurred

the robot to learn a reward function that is representative for each type,
through the employment of an inverse reinforcement learning algorithm. The
learned model is then used as part of a Mixed Observability Markov Decision

a new user that was not included in the training set, and can compute a policy
for the robot that will be aligned to the preference of this new user and will
be robust to deviations of the human actions from prior demonstrations. Finally
we validate the approach using data collected in human subject experiments, and

example, discrete Schr\""odinger operators, Jacobi matrices, CMV matrices, and
continuum Schr\""odinger operators.
  In the main body of this paper we show how to construct counterexamples to
the Kotani-Last conjecture for continuum Schr\""odinger operators by adapting
the approach developed by Volberg and Yuditskii to construct counterexamples to
the Kotani-Last conjecture for Jacobi matrices. This approach relates the
reflectionless operators associated with the prescribed spectrum to a family of
character-automorphic Hardy spaces and then relates the shift action on the
space of operators to the resulting action on the associated characters. The
key to our approach is an explicit correspondence between the space of
continuum reflectionless Schr\""odinger operators associated with a given set
and the space of reflectionless Jacobi matrices associated with a derived set.
Once this correspondence is established we can rely to a large extent on the
previous work of Volberg and Yuditskii to produce the resulting action on the
space of characters. We analyze this action and identify situations where we
can observe absolute continuity without almost periodicity.
  In the appendix we show how to implement this strategy and obtain analogous
results for extended CMV matrices.

scattering amplitudes map into correlators of twist fields in the two
dimensional non-linear O(6) sigma model, similar to those appearing in recent
studies of entanglement entropy. We provide evidence for this assertion by
combining the intuition springing from the string worldsheet picture and the
predictions coming from the OPE series. One of the main implications of these
considerations is that scattering amplitudes receive equally important
contributions at strong coupling from both the minimal string area and its
fluctuations in the sphere.

are particularly recognized for their efficient decoding scheme. The decoding
scheme, known as the sum-product, is an iterative algorithm consisting of
passing messages between variable and check nodes of the factor graph. The
sum-product algorithm is fully parallelizable, owing to the fact that all
messages can be update concurrently. However, since it requires extensive
number of highly interconnected wires, the fully-parallel implementation of the
sum-product on chips is exceedingly challenging. Stochastic decoding
algorithms, which exchange binary messages, are of great interest for
mitigating this challenge and have been the focus of extensive research over
the past decade. They significantly reduce the required wiring and
computational complexity of the message-passing algorithm. Even though
stochastic decoders have been shown extremely effective in practice, the
theoretical aspect and understanding of such algorithms remains limited at
large. Our main objective in this paper is to address this issue. We first
propose a novel algorithm referred to as the Markov based stochastic decoding.
Then, we provide concrete quantitative guarantees on its performance for
tree-structured as well as general factor graphs. More specifically, we provide
upper-bounds on the first and second moments of the error, illustrating that
the proposed algorithm is an asymptotically consistent estimate of the
sum-product algorithm. We also validate our theoretical predictions with
experimental results, showing we achieve comparable performance to other
practical stochastic decoders.

scalable solution for M2M networks with large number of heterogeneous devices.
In this paper, a scalable hybrid MAC protocol, which consists of a contention
period and a transmission period, is designed for heterogeneous M2M networks.
In this protocol, different devices with pre-set priorities (hierarchical
contending probabilities) firstly contend the transmission opportunities
following the convention based $p$-persistent CSMA mechanism. Only the
successful devices will be assigned a time slot for transmission following the
reservation based TDMA mechanism. If the devices failed in contention at
previous frame, to ensure the fairness among all devices, their contending
priorities will be raised by increasing their contending probabilities at the
next frame. To balance the tradeoff between the contention and transmission
period in each frame, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the
channel utility by finding the key design parameters: the contention duration,
initial contending probability and the incremental indicator. Analytical and

to a wealth of interesting nonlinear phenomena. This includes frequency mixing,
optical rectification or nonlinear current generation, which are of particular
interest for generating radiation in spectral regions that are difficult to
access, such as the terahertz gap. Owing to its specific linear dispersion and
high electron mobility at room temperature, graphene is particularly attractive
for realizing strong nonlinear effects. However, since graphene is a
centrosymmetric material, second-order nonlinearities a priori cancel, which
imposes to rely on less attractive third-order nonlinearities. It was
nevertheless recently demonstrated that dc-second-order nonlinear currents as
well as ultrafast ac-currents can be generated in graphene under optical
excitation. The asymmetry is introduced by the excitation at oblique incidence,
resulting in the transfer of photon momentum to the electron system, known as
the photon drag effect. Here, we show broadband coherent terahertz emission,
ranging from about 0.1-4 THz, in epitaxial graphene under femtosecond optical
excitation, induced by a dynamical photon drag current. We demonstrate that, in
contrast to most optical processes in graphene, the next-nearest-neighbor

One of the issues is that numerical integration of expressions of current

investigated ways to simplify these expressions, using Horner schemes and
common subexpression elimination. Our approach applies MCTS, a search procedure
that has been successful in AI. We use it to find near-optimal Horner schemes.
Although MCTS finds better solutions, this approach gives rise to two further
challenges. (1) MCTS (with UCT) introduces a constant, $C_p$ that governs the
balance between exploration and exploitation. This constant has to be tuned
manually. (2) There should be more guided exploration at the bottom of the
tree, since the current approach reduces the quality of the solution towards
the end of the expression. We investigate NMCS (Nested Monte Carlo Search) to
address both issues, but find that NMCS is computationally unfeasible for our
problem. Then, we modify the MCTS formula by introducing a dynamic
exploration-exploitation parameter $T$ that decreases linearly with the
iteration number. Consequently, we provide a performance analysis. We observe
that a variable $C_p$ solves our domain: it yields more exploration at the
bottom and as a result the tuning problem has been simplified. The region in
$C_p$ for which good values are found is increased by more than a tenfold. This
result encourages us to continue our research to solve other prominent problems

each reserve and the interclaim times are generally distributed. The two
reserves are coupled in the sense that at a claim arrival epoch, claims are
being requested from both reserves and the amounts requested are correlated. In
addition, the claim amounts are correlated with the time elapsed since the
previous claim arrival. We focus on the probability that this bivariate reserve
process survives indefinitely. The infinite- horizon survival problem is shown
to be related to the problem of determining the equilibrium distribution of a
random walk with vector-valued increments with reflecting boundary. This
reflected random walk is actually the waiting time process in a queueing system
dual to the bivariate ruin process. Under assumptions on the arrival process
and the claim amounts, and using Wiener-Hopf factor- ization with one
parameter, we explicitly determine the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the
survival function, c.q., the two-dimensional equilibrium waiting time
distribution. Finally, the bivariate transforms are evaluated for some
examples, including for proportional reinsurance, and the bivariate ruin
functions are numerically calculated using an efficient inversion scheme.

emission from the Z-source Sco~X-1 during its evolution between the Horizontal
(HB) and Flaring(FB) branches observed with the RXTE during the 1996 -- 2002
period. We find that the broad-band (3 - 250 keV) energy spectra during all
spectral states can be adequately reproduced by a model, consisting of two
Comptonized components and an iron-line. We suggest that the seed photons of
kT_s1~0.7 keV coming from the disk and of temperature kT_s2~1.8 keV coming from
the neutron star (NS) are each upscattered by hot electrons of a ""Compton
cloud"" (herein Comptb1 and Comptb2 components respectively with which are
associated similarly subscripted parameters). The photon power-law index
Gamma_{2} is almost constant (Gamma_{2}~2) for all spectral states. In turn,
Gamma_{1} demonstrates a two-phase behavior with the spectral state: Gamma_{1}
is quasi-constant at the level Gamma_{1}~2 for the HB-NB and Gamma_{1} is less
than 2, namely in the range of 1.3<Gamma_1<2, when source traces the FB. We
also detect a decrease kT_{s2} from 1.8 keV to 0.7 keV during the FB. We
interpret this apparent quasi-stability of the indices during the HB-NB in the
framework of the model in which the spectrum is determined by the Comptonized
thermal components. This established for the Comptonized spectral components of
the Z-source Sco~X-1 is similar to that was previously found in the atoll
sources 4U~1728-34, GX~3+1 and 4U~1820-30 and the Z-source GX~340+0 through all
spectral states. However we interpret the index reduction phase detected during
the FB in Sco~X-1 within the framework of a model in which the spectrum at the
FB is determined by high radiation pressure from the NS surface.

measured with a 190 GeV$/c$ proton beam impinging on a liquid hydrogen target.
Cross section ratios are determined in three intervals of the Feynman variable
$x_{F}$ of the fast proton. A significant violation of the OZI rule is found,
confirming earlier findings. Its kinematic dependence on $x_{F}$ and on the
invariant mass $M_{p\mathrm{V}}$ of the system formed by fast proton
$p_\mathrm{fast}$ and vector meson $V$ is discussed in terms of diffractive
production of $p_\mathrm{fast}V$ resonances in competition with central
production. The measurement of the spin density matrix element $\rho_{00}$ of
the vector mesons in different selected reference frames provides another
handle to distinguish the contributions of these two major reaction types.
Again, dependences of the alignment on $x_{F}$ and on $M_{p\mathrm{V}}$ are
found. Most of the observations can be traced back to the existence of several
excited baryon states contributing to $\omega$ production which are absent in
the case of the $\phi$ meson. Removing the low-mass $M_{p\mathrm{V}}$ resonant
region, the OZI rule is found to be violated by a factor of eight,
independently of $x_\mathrm{F}$.

that (iii) the jet fluid is made of electron-positron plasma and (iv) the inner

that one can still define operators that mimic the inside of the horizon, but
at the price of violating microcausality. For supergravity fields we find that
commutators at spacelike separation generically ~ exp(-S/2). Similar results
hold for stable black holes that form in collapse. The general lesson may be
that a small amount of non-locality, even over arbitrarily large spacelike

to a nonlinear electromagnetic field in the background of anti-de Sitter
spaces. We consider two types of nonlinear electromagnetic field namely,
logarithmic and exponential forms. We investigate the geometric effects of
nonlinearity parameter and find that for large $r$, these solutions recover the
rotating back string solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory. We calculate the
conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the rotating black string. We also
analyze thermodynamics of the spacetime and verify the validity of the first
law of thermodynamics for the obtained solutions.

using inverse and forward Laplace transforms. The resulting integral is to be
solved instead. The method is extended by parametrizing the series. A further
Laplace transform with respect to it will offer more options for solving a
series.
