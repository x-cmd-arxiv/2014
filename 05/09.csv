measured in the direction of the reaction plane and orthogonal to it. The $v_2$
coefficient was measured with three different methods and in three centrality
classes in the interval 0-50%. A positive $v_2$ is observed in mid-central

$0.204_{-0.036}^{+0.099}$ (tot.unc.) in the interval $2 < p_{\rm T} < 6$

radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting from ambient interference is an enabler
for energy-efficient wireless communication. In this paper, we model and
analyze cognitive and energy harvesting-based D2D communication in cellular
networks. The cognitive D2D transmitters harvest energy from ambient
interference and use one of the channels allocated to cellular users (in uplink
or downlink), which is referred to as the D2D channel, to communicate with the
corresponding receivers. We investigate two spectrum access policies for
cellular communication in the uplink or downlink, namely, random spectrum
access (RSA) policy and prioritized spectrum access (PSA) policy. In RSA, any
of the available channels including the channel used by the D2D transmitters
can be selected randomly for cellular communication, while in PSA the D2D
channel is used only when all of the other channels are occupied. A D2D
transmitter can communicate successfully with its receiver only when it
harvests enough energy to perform channel inversion toward the receiver, the
D2D channel is free, and the $\mathsf{SINR}$ at the receiver is above the
required threshold; otherwise, an outage occurs for the D2D communication. We
use tools from stochastic geometry to evaluate the performance of the proposed
communication system model with general path-loss exponent in terms of outage
probability for D2D and cellular users. We show that energy harvesting can be a
reliable alternative to power cognitive D2D transmitters while achieving
acceptable performance. Under the same $\mathsf{SINR}$ outage requirements as
for the non-cognitive case, cognitive channel access improves the outage
probability for D2D users for both the spectrum access policies.

dark pool is the mid-price and that no fees are due for posting orders. We
allow for partial trade executions in the dark pool, and we find the optimal

caused by a combination of a lack of quasi-periodic oscillations and an excess

halos extracted from the MultiDark MDR1 cosmological simulation. We find that
the simulated halos, are extremely prolate on small scales, and increasingly
spherical on larger ones. Due to this trend, analytical projection along the
line of sight produces an overestimate of the concentration index as a
decreasing function of radius, which we quantify by using both the intrinsic
distribution of 3D concentrations ($c_{200}$) and isodensity shape on weak and
strong lensing scales. We find this difference to be $\sim 18\%$ ($\sim 9\%$)
for low (medium) mass cluster halos with intrinsically low concentrations
($c_{200}=1-3$), while we find virtually no difference for halos with
intrinsically high concentrations. Isodensities are found to be fairly
well-aligned throughout the entirety of the radial scale of each halo
population. However, major axes of individual halos have been found to deviate
by as much as $\sim 30^{\circ}$. We also present a value-added catalog of our

analyzed during the stress-induced collapse of porous berlinite, AlPO4,
containing up to 50 vol% porosity. Stress collapse occurs in a series of
individual events (avalanches), and each avalanche leads to a jerk in sample
compression with corresponding acoustic emission (AE) signals. The distribution
of AE avalanche energies can be approximately described by a power law over a
large stress interval. We observed several collapse mechanisms whereby less
porous minerals show the superposition of independent jerks, which were not
related to the major collapse at the failure stress. In highly porous berlinite
(40% and 50%) an increase of the energy emission occurred near the failure
point. In contrast, the less porous samples did not show such an increase in
energy emission. Instead, in the near vicinity of the main failure point they
showed a reduction in the energy exponent to ~ 1.4, which is consistent with
the value reported for compressed porous systems displaying critical behavior.
This indicated that a critical avalanche regime with a lack of precursor events
occurs. In this case, all preceding large events were false alarms and
unrelated to the main failure event. Our results identify a method to use
pico-seismicity detection of foreshocks to warn of mine collapse before the

signature of jet interaction with the galaxy disk. The spectrum is that of a
molecular hydrogen emission galaxy (MOHEG), with a large ratio of H2 over 7.7

close spatial correspondence between the H2 and CO emission from the anomalous

the X(CO) value is 10 times lower than the Milky Way value because of high
kinetic temperature and enhanced turbulence. The H2 disk has been overrun and

fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve
the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bins. After
accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the
width of the MS distribution is $\sim 0.2$ dex and remains constant over cosmic
time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with
our best fit $\log\textrm{SFR}(M_*,t) = \left(0.84 \pm 0.02 - 0.026 \pm 0.003

viral diversity estimation proposed so far are intended to take benefit of the
longer reads produced by some NGS platforms in order to estimate a population
of haplotypes. Our goal here is to take advantage of distinct virtues of a
certain kind of NGS platform - the platform SOLiD (Life Technologies) is an
example - that has not received much attention due to the short length of its
reads, which renders haplotype estimation very difficult. However, this kind of
platform has a very low error rate and extremely deep coverage per site and our
method is designed to take advantage of these characteristics. We propose to
measure the populational genetic diversity through a family of multinomial
probability distributions indexed by the sites of the virus genome, each one
representing the populational distribution of the diversity per site. The
implementation of the method focuses on two main optimization strategies: a
read mapping/alignment procedure that aims at the recovery of the maximum
possible number of short-reads; the estimation of the multinomial parameters
through a Bayesian approach, which, unlike simple frequency counting, allows
one to take into account the prior information of the control population within
the inference of a posterior experimental condition and provides a natural way
to separate signal from noise, since it automatically furnishes Bayesian
confidence intervals. The methods described in this paper have been implemented
as an integrated tool called Tanden (Tool for Analysis of Diversity in Viral
Populations).

in-plane anisotropy term was missing for the mono-layers and distinctly
different DM interactions were obtained for the different stackings. The chiral

characterize the X-ray point source populations of three nearby early-type

sample span 3-10 Gyr. X-ray binary population synthesis models predict that the
field LMXBs associated with younger stellar populations should be more numerous
and luminous per unit stellar mass than older populations due to the evolution
of LMXB donor star masses. Crucially, the combination of deep Chandra and HST
observations allows us to test directly this prediction by identifying and
removing counterparts to X-ray point sources that are unrelated to the field
LMXB populations, including LMXBs that are formed dynamically in globular
clusters, Galactic stars, and background AGN/galaxies. We find that the ""young""
early-type galaxy NGC 3384 (~2-5 Gyr) has an excess of luminous field LMXBs

consistent with the X-ray binary population synthesis model predictions;

dwarfs are dynamically supported by their observed velocity dispersions.
However their spatial distributions around the MW is not at random and this
could challenge their origin, previously assumed to be residues of primordial
galaxies accreted by the MW potential. Here we show that alternatively, dSphs
could be the residue of tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs), which would have
interacted with the Galactic hot gaseous halo and disk. TDGs are gas-rich and
have been formed in a tidal tail produced during an ancient merger event at the
M31 location, and expelled towards the MW. Our simulations show that low-mass
TDGs are fragile to an interaction with the MW disk and halo hot gas. During
the interaction, their stellar content is progressively driven out of
equilibrium and strongly expands, leading to low surface brightness feature and
mimicking high dynamical M/L ratios. Our modeling can reproduce the properties,
including the kinematics, of classical MW dwarfs within the mass range of the
Magellanic Clouds to Draco. An ancient gas-rich merger at the M31 location
could then challenge the currently assumed high content of dark matter in dwarf
galaxies. We propose a simple observational test with the coming GAIA mission,
to follow their expected stellar expansion, which should not be observed within
the current theoretical framework.

contributed to the observed u-shaped relation between GC specific frequencies
S_N and host galaxy luminosity M_V. We used our MUESLI code to calculate GC
survival rates for typical early-type galaxy potentials covering a wide range
of observed galaxy properties. We do this for isotropic and radially
anisotropic GC velocity distributions. We find that the calculated GC survival
fraction, f_s, depends linearly on the logarithm of the 3D mass density,
rho_3D, within the galaxy's half light radius, with f_s proportional to
(rho_3D)^(-0.17). For a given galaxy, survival rates are lower for radially
anisotropic configurations than for the isotropic GC cases. We apply these
relations to a literature sample of 219 early-type galaxies from Harris et al.
(2013) in the range M_V=[-24.5:-15.5] mag. The expected GC survival fraction
ranges from ~50% for the most massive galaxies with the largest radii to ~10%
for the most compact galaxies. We find that intermediate luminosity galaxies
M_V=[-20.5:-17.5] mag have the strongest expected GC erosion. Within the
considered literature sample, the predicted GC survival fraction therefore
defines a u-shaped relation with M_V, similar to the relation between specific
frequency S_N and M_V. As a consequence, the u-shape of S_N vs. M_V gets erased
almost entirely when correcting the S_N values for the effect of GC erosion. We
conclude that tidal erosion is an important contributor to the u-shaped
relation between GC specific frequency and host galaxy luminosity. It must be
taken into account when inferring primordial star cluster formation
efficiencies from observations of GC systems in the nearby universe.

photometric and spectroscopic chemodynamical survey of nearby early-type
galaxies (ETGs) and their globular cluster (GC) systems. The SLUGGS (SAGES
Legacy Unifying Globulars and GalaxieS) survey is being carried out primarily
with Subaru/Suprime-Cam and Keck/DEIMOS. The former provides deep gri imaging
over a 900 arcmin^2 field-of-view to characterize GC and host galaxy colors and
spatial distributions, and to identify spectroscopic targets. The NIR CaII
triplet provides GC line-of-sight velocities and metallicities out to typically
~8 R_e, and to ~15 R_e in some cases. New techniques to extract integrated
stellar kinematics and metallicities to large radii (~2-3 R_e) are used in
concert with GC data to create two-dimensional velocity and metallicity maps
for comparison with simulations of galaxy formation. The advantages of SLUGGS
compared with other, complementary, 2D-chemodynamical surveys are its superior
velocity resolution, radial extent, and multiple halo tracers. We describe the
sample of 25 nearby ETGs, the selection criteria for galaxies and GCs, the
observing strategies, the data reduction techniques, and modeling methods. The
survey observations are nearly complete and more than 30 papers have so far
been published using SLUGGS data. Here we summarize some initial results,
including signatures of two-phase galaxy assembly, evidence for GC metallicity
bimodality, and a novel framework for the formation of extended star clusters
and ultracompact dwarfs. An integrated overview of current chemodynamical
constraints on GC systems points to separate, in-situ formation modes at high
redshifts for metal-poor and metal-rich GCs.

exchanged between the spectators. Through an argument that relates the diagrams
with these Glauber gluons to events containing additional soft scatterings, we
suggest that this failure of the CSS cancellation actually corresponds to a
failure of the `standard' factorisation formula with hard, soft and collinear
functions to describe $E_T$ at leading power. This is because the observable
receives a leading power contribution from multiple parton interaction (or
spectator-spectator Glauber) processes. We also suggest that the same argument
can be used to show that a whole class of observables, which we refer to as MPI
sensitive observables, do not obey the standard factorisation at leading power.
MPI sensitive observables are observables whose distributions in hadron-hadron
collisions are disrupted strongly by the presence of multiple parton
interactions (MPI) in the event. Examples of further MPI sensitive observables
include the beam thrust $B^+_{a,b}$ and transverse thrust.

of the LW radiation in this scenario, ionizing radiation from these galaxies
may accompany the LW radiation. We present cosmological simulations resolving
the collapse of primordial gas into an atomic cooling halo, including the

is not self-shielded from the ionizing radiation, the collapse can be delayed
by ~ 25 Myr. When the ionized gas does collapse, the free electrons that are
present catalyze H2 formation. In turn, H2 cooling becomes efficient in the
center of the halo, and DCBH formation is prevented. We emphasize, however,
that in many cases the gas collapsing into atomic cooling haloes at high
redshift is self-shielding to ionizing radiation. Therefore, it is only in a
fraction of such haloes in which DCBH formation is prevented due to
reionization.

system naturally poised at the margin between underconstraint and
overconstraint. This marginal stability has traditionally been understood in
terms of isostaticity, the equality of the number of mechanical contacts and
the number of degrees of freedom. Quasicontacts, pairs of spheres on the verge
of coming in contact, are irrelevant for static stability, but they come into
play when considering dynamic stability, as does the distribution of contact
forces. We show that the effects of marginal dynamic stability, as manifested
in the distributions of quasicontacts and weak contacts, are consequential and
nontrivial. We study these ideas first in the context of MRJ packing of
d-dimensional spheres, where we show that the abundance of quasicontacts grows
at a faster rate than that of contacts. We reexamine a calculation of Jin et
al. (Phys. Rev. E 82, 051126, 2010), where quasicontacts were originally
neglected, and we explore the effect of their inclusion in the calculation.
This analysis yields an estimate of the asymptotic behavior of the packing
density in high dimensions. We argue that this estimate should be reinterpreted
as a lower bound. The latter part of the paper is devoted to Bravais lattice
packings that possess the minimum number of contacts to maintain mechanical
stability. We show that quasicontacts play an even more important role in these
packings. We also show that jammed lattices are a useful setting for studying
the Edwards ensemble, which weights each mechanically stable configuration
equally and does not account for dynamics. This ansatz fails to predict the
power-law distribution of near-zero contact forces, $P(f)\sim f^\theta$.

trigger superradiant instabilities. To investigate this effect, we perform the
first fully-consistent linear analysis of the Ernst spacetime, an exact
solution of the Einstein--Maxwell equations describing a black hole immersed in
a uniform magnetic field $B$. In the limit in which the black-hole mass
vanishes, the background reduces to the marginally stable Melvin spacetime. The
presence of an event horizon introduces a small dissipative term, resulting in
a set of long-lived -- or unstable -- modes. We provide a simple interpretation
of the mode spectrum in terms of a small perfect absorber immersed in a
confining box of size $\sim1/B$ and show that rotation triggers a superradiant
instability. By studying scalar perturbations of a magnetized Kerr--Newman
black hole, we are able to confirm and quantify the details of this
instability. The instability time scale can be orders of magnitude shorter than
that associated to massive bosonic fields. The instability extracts angular
momentum from the event horizon, competing against accretion. This implies that
strong magnetic fields set an upper bound on the black-hole spin. Conversely,
observations of highly-spinning massive black holes impose an intrinsic limit
to the strength of the surrounding magnetic field. We discuss the astrophysical
implications of our results and the limitations of the Ernst spacetime to
describe realistic astrophysical configurations.

internal space-time symmetries dictated by Wigner's little groups. For massive
particles, the little group is like the three-dimensional rotation group, while
it is like the two-dimensional Euclidean group for massless particles. It is
shown that the Poincar\'e sphere, in addition, has a symmetry parameter
corresponding to reducing the particle mass from a positive value to zero. The
Poincar\'e sphere thus the gives one unified picture of Wigner's little groups
for massive and massless particles.

two-dimensional moving boundary problems with prescribed boundary evolution
that have arbitrarily high order of accuracy, both in space and in time. At the
core of our approach is the use of a universal mesh: a stationary background
mesh containing the domain of interest for all times that adapts to the
geometry of the immersed domain by adjusting a small number of mesh elements in
the neighborhood of the moving boundary. The resulting method maintains an
exact representation of the (prescribed) moving boundary at the discrete level,
or an approximation of the appropriate order, yet is immune to large
distortions of the mesh under large deformations of the domain. The framework
is general, making it possible to achieve any desired order of accuracy in
space and time by selecting a preferred and suitable finite-element space on
the universal mesh for the problem at hand, and a preferred and suitable time
integrator for ordinary differential equations. We illustrate our approach by
constructing a particular class of methods, and apply them to a
prescribed-boundary variant of the Stefan problem. We present numerical
evidence for the order of accuracy of our schemes in one and two dimensions.

here we extend our distance range of interest to include published distance

individual Local Group galaxies available to date. Based on a careful,
statistically weighted combination of the main stellar population tracers
(Cepheids, RR Lyrae variables, and the magnitude of the tip of the red-giant

$(m-M)_0^{\rm LMC} = 18.50$ mag---and a fully internally consistent set of

establish a robust and unbiased, near-field extragalactic distance ladder.

rolled with self-positioned layers of InGaAs/Cr forming compact multi-turn
tubular structures that consist on successive graphene/metal/semiconductor
heterojunctions on a radial superlattice. Using elasticity theory and Raman
spectroscopy we show that it is possible to produce homogeneously curved
graphene with curvature radius on the 600nm-1200nm range. Additionally, the
study of tubular structures also allows the extraction of values for the
elastic constants of graphene that are in excellent agreement with elastic
constants found in the literature. However, our process has the advantage of
leading to a well-defined and nonlocal curvature. Since our curvature radius
lie in a range between the large radius studied using mechanical bending and
the reduced radius induced by Atomic Force Microscopy experiments we can figure
out whether bending effects can be a majoritary driving force for modifications
in graphene electronic status. From the results described in this work one can
assume that curvature effects solely do not modify the Raman signature of
graphene and that strain phenomena observed previously can be ascribed to
stretching due to the formation of local atomic bonds. This implies that the
interactions of graphene with additional materials on heterostructures must be
investigated in detail prior to the development of applications and devices.

models. Utilizing image restoration aspects, the proposed segmentation model
can effectively and robustly tackle high noisy images, blurry images, images
with missing pixels, and vector-valued images. In particular, one of the most
important segmentation models, the piecewise constant Mumford-Shah model, can
be extended easily in this way to segment gray and vector-valued images
corrupted for example by noise, blur or missing pixels after coupling a new
data fidelity term which comes from image restoration topics. It can be solved
efficiently using the alternating minimization algorithm, and we prove the
convergence of this algorithm with three variables under mild condition.
Experiments on many synthetic and real-world images demonstrate that our method
gives better segmentation results in comparison to others state-of-the-art
segmentation models especially for blurry images and images with missing pixels

problem leads tests to not well maintain the significance level and to be less

smoothing test as if the model were univariate, and can be consistent against
any global alternatives and can detect local alternatives distinct from the
null at a fast rate that existing local smoothing tests can achieve only when
the model is univariate. Simulations are carried out to examine the performance
of our methodology. A real data analysis is conducted for illustration. The
method can readily be extended to global smoothing methodology and other

whose observation could shed light on the physics of core-collapse supernovae.
When born with sufficient differential rotation, these stars are susceptible to
a shear instability (the ""low-T/|W| instability""), but such rotation can also
amplify magnetic fields to strengths where they have a considerable impact on
the dynamics of the stellar matter. Using a new magnetohydrodynamics module for
the Spectral Einstein Code, we have simulated a differentially-rotating neutron
star in full 3D to study the effects of magnetic fields on this instability.
Though strong toroidal fields were predicted to suppress the low-T/|W|
instability, we find that they do so only in a small range of field strengths.
Below 4e13 G, poloidal seed fields do not wind up fast enough to have an effect
before the instability saturates, while above 5e14 G, magnetic instabilities
can actually amplify a global quadrupole mode (this threshold may be even lower
in reality, as small-scale magnetic instabilities remain difficult to resolve
numerically). Thus, the prospects for observing gravitational waves from such
systems are not in fact diminished over most of the magnetic parameter space.
  Additionally, we report that the detailed development of the low-T/|W|
instability, including its growth rate, depends strongly on the particular
numerical methods used. The high-order methods we employ suggest that growth
might be considerably slower than found in some previous simulations.

explain why equilibrium DNA 'brick' structures self-assemble even if undesigned

the possible consequences of this dependence, we apply the idea to a scalar
field in a closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background, using a simple model

result is a time-dependent cosmological constant, producing a vast amount of
inflation that is independent of the mass of the matter field or its effective

buffers of the volatile memory type, and an embedded microprocessor, which have
been interconnected by a port. This microprocessor run a small file system
which called flash translation layer (FTL). This software controls and

  An Upper Bound to Signal Degrees of Freedom","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The study of degrees of freedom of signals observed within spatially diverse
broadband multipath fields is an area of ongoing investigation and has a wide
range of applications, including characterising broadband MIMO and cooperative
networks. However, a fundamental question arises: given a size limitation on
the observation region, what is the upper bound on the degrees of freedom of
signals observed within a broadband multipath field over a finite time window?
In order to address this question, we characterize the multipath field as a sum
of a finite number of orthogonal waveforms or spatial modes. We show that (i)
the ""effective observation time"" is independent of spatial modes and different
from actual observation time, (ii) in wideband transmission regimes, the
""effective bandwidth"" is spatial mode dependent and varies from the given
frequency bandwidth. These findings clearly indicate the strong coupling
between space and time as well as space and frequency in spatially diverse
wideband multipath fields. As a result, signal degrees of freedom does not
agree with the well-established degrees of freedom result as a product of
spatial degrees of freedom and time-frequency degrees of freedom. Instead,
analogous to Shannon's communication model where signals are encoded in only
one spatial mode, the available signal degrees of freedom in spatially diverse
wideband multipath fields is the time-bandwidth product result extended from
one spatial mode to finite modes. We also show that the degrees of freedom is

III, 257--277",,,"math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Q-curvature has been playing a central role in conformal geometry since
its discovery by T. Branson. It has natural analogy in CR geometry, however,
the CR Q-curvature vanishes on the boundary of a strictly pseudoconvex domain
in C^{n+1} with a natural choice of contact form. This fact enables us to
define a ""secondary"" Q-curvature, which we call Q-prime curvature (it was first
introduced by J. Case and P. Yang in the case n=1). The integral of the Q-prime
curvature, the total Q-prime curvature, is a CR invariant of the boundary. When
n=1, it agrees with the Burns-Epstein invariant, which is a Chern-Simons type
invariant in CR geometry. For all n>=1, it has non-trivial variation under the
deformation of domains. Combining the variational formula with the deformation
complex of CR structures, we show that the total Q-prime curvature takes local
maximum at the standard CR sphere in a formal sense.

store discretely distributed fixed-point attractors as memory patterns. When
the network stores the memory patterns extensively, however, the model has
other attractors besides the memory patterns. These attractors are called
spurious memories. Both spurious states and memory states are equilibrium, so
there is little difference between their dynamics. Recent physiological
experiments have shown that short-term dynamic synapse called synaptic
depression decreases its transmission efficacy to postsynaptic neurons
according to the activities of presynaptic neurons. Previous studies have shown
that synaptic depression induces oscillation in the network and decreases the
storage capacity at finite temperature. How synaptic depression affects
spurious states, however, is still unclear. We investigate the effect of
synaptic depression on spurious states through Monte Carlo simulation. The
results demonstrate that synaptic depression does not affect the memory states
but mainly destabilizes the spurious states and induces the periodic
oscillations.

singular origin. Its future development depends upon the curvature of the
spatial sections: spatially flat or hyperboloid universes expand forever and
this expansion dilutes the energy density and pressure of the gas, while a
universe with compact spherical sections reaches a maximal expansion, after
which it reverses its motion and recollapses to a final crunch singularity

the evolution of the universe filled with the collisionless gas once a

systematics have been limited.
  Our goal is to assess a variety of photometric stellar extinction estimates,
including both 2D and 3D extinction maps, using independent extinction measures
based on a large spectroscopic sample of stars towards the Milky Way bulge. We
employ stellar atmospheric parameters derived from high-resolution $H$-band
APOGEE spectra, combined with theoretical stellar isochrones, to calculate
line-of-sight extinction and distances for a sample of more than 2400 giants
towards the Milky Way bulge. We compare these extinction values to those
predicted by individual near-IR and near+mid-IR stellar colors, 2D bulge
extinction maps and 3D extinction maps. The long baseline, near+mid-IR stellar
colors are, on average, the most accurate predictors of the APOGEE extinction
estimates, and the 2D and 3D extinction maps derived from different stellar
populations along different sightlines show varying degrees of reliability. We
present the results of all of the comparisons and discuss reasons for the
observed discrepancies. We also demonstrate how the particular stellar

we dismiss the kinetic elasto-plastic picture, where a flow is conceived as a

and the possible production of emission in the EUV band. We simulate the
propagation of a dense $10^4$ K chromospheric jet upwards along a coronal loop,
by means of a 2-D cylindrical MHD model, including gravity, radiative losses,
thermal conduction and magnetic induction. The jet propagates in a complete
atmosphere including the chromosphere and a tenuous cool ($\sim 0.8$ MK)
corona, linked through a steep transition region. In our reference model, the
jet's initial speed is 70 km/s, its initial density is $10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$, and
the ambient uniform magnetic field is 10 G. We explore also other values of jet
speed and density in 1-D, and of magnetic field in 2-D, and the jet propagation
in a hotter ($\sim 1.5$ MK) background loop. While the initial speed of the jet
does not allow it to reach the loop apex, a hot shock front develops ahead of
it and travels to the other extreme of the loop. The shock front compresses the
coronal plasma and heats it to about $10^6$ K. As a result, a bright moving
front becomes visible in the 171 \AA\ channel of the SDO/AIA mission. This
result generally applies to all the other explored cases, except for the
propagation in the hotter loop. For a cool, low-density initial coronal loop,
the post-shock plasma ahead of upward chromospheric flows might explain at
least part of the observed correspondence between type II spicules and EUV
emission excess.

describing the lipid-lipid interactions on each leaflet, with two lipidic

membrane elasticity, via both a local spontaneous curvature, which varies as
$C_0+C_1(\psi_1-\psi_2)/2$, and a bending modulus equal to
$\kappa_0+\kappa_1(\psi_1+\psi_2)/2$. This model allows us to define curved
patches as membrane domains where the asymmetry in composition,
$\psi_1-\psi_2$, is large, and thick and stiff patches where $\psi_1+\psi_2$ is
large. These thick patches are good candidates for being lipidic rafts, as
observed in cell membranes, which are composed primarily of saturated lipids
forming a liquid-ordered domain and are known to be thick and flat
nano-domains. The lipid-lipid structure factors and correlation functions are
computed for globally spherical membranes and planar ones. Phase diagrams are
established, within a Gaussian approximation, showing the occurrence of two
types of Structure Disordered phases, with correlations between either curved
or thick patches, and an Ordered phase, corresponding to the divergence of the
structure factor at a finite wave vector. The varying bending modulus plays a
central role for curved membranes, where the driving force $\kappa_1C_0^2$ is
balanced by the line tension, to form raft domains of size ranging from 10 to
100~nm. For planar membranes, raft domains emerge via the cross-correlation
with curved domains. A global picture emerges from curvature-induced
mechanisms, described in the literature for planar membranes, to coupled
curvature- and bending-induced mechanisms in curved membranes forming a closed
vesicle.

adsorption energies and reduce the equilibrium distances. Nevertheless, they do
not influence the spatial configuration of the adsorbed molecules. Their effect
on the electronic density is a non-isotropic, delocalized accumulation of

to solve this problem is to try instead to associate a tree (or even a network)
to the multiset $\Sigma_{\Pi}$ consisting of all those bipartitions $\{A,X-A\}$
with $A$ a part of some partition in $\Pi$. The rational behind this approach
is that a phylogenetic tree with leaf set $X$ can be uniquely represented by
the set of bipartitions of $X$ induced by its edges. Motivated by these
considerations, given a multiset $\Sigma$ of bipartitions corresponding to a
phylogenetic tree on $X$, in this paper we introduce and study the set
$P(\Sigma)$ consisting of those multisets of partitions $\Pi$ of $X$ with
$\Sigma_{\Pi}=\Sigma$. More specifically, we characterize when $P(\Sigma)$ is
non-empty, and also identify some partitions in $P(\Sigma)$ that are of maximum
and minimum size. We also show that it is NP-complete to decide when
$P(\Sigma)$ is non-empty in case $\Sigma$ is an arbitrary multiset of
bipartitions of $X$. Ultimately, we hope that by gaining a better understanding
of the mapping that takes an arbitrary partition system $\Pi$ to the multiset

begin to have no solutions, as the hadronic widths of the $\rho$ and the $a_1$
mesons diverge signalling deconfinement. Close to, and at $T=T_c$ there are no
pions left in the medium and chiral symmetry is restored, so that the sum rules

prove the co-primeness of the terms in the nonlinear dKdV equation for general
initial conditions and boundary conditions, by using the localization of

Finally, large anisotropies yield an isotropic-nematic transition at low

orbital variations of the line-of-sight absorption toward the X-ray emission
from the wind-wind interaction zone yields information on the wind densities of
both stars. X-ray spectra have been collected at three key orbital phases to
probe the winds of both stars. Optical photometry has been gathered to set
constraints on the orbital inclination of the system. The X-ray spectra reveal
prominent variations of the intervening column density toward the X-ray

wind optical depths at 1 keV. The lack of strong optical eclipses sets an upper
limit of about 68 degrees on the orbital inclination. The analysis of the
variations of the X-ray spectra suggests an inclination in the range 54 - 61
degrees and indicates that the secondary wind momentum ratio exceeds that of
the primary by at least a factor 5. Our models further suggest that the bulk of

metallic glass forming liquids. The experimental methods to determine the
kinetic fragility, relaxation behavior and thermodynamic functions of
undercooled metallic liquids are introduced. Existing data are assessed and
discussed using the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation and in the frameworks of the
Adam-Gibbs as well as the Cohen-Turnbull free volume approach. In contrast to
pure metals and most non glass forming alloys, bulk glass formers are
moderately strong liquids. In general the fragility parameter $D^{*} $
increases with the complexity of the alloy with differences between the alloy
families, e.g. noble-metal based alloys being more fragile than Zr-based
alloys. At least some bulk metallic glass forming liquids, such as Vitreloy 1,
undergo transitions from a fragile state at high temperatures to a strong state
at low temperatures with indications that in Zr-based alloys this behavior is a
common phenomenon.

seen in particular in the evolution with applied load of the contact area and

These transitions are correlated with the contact area shape, which is affected
by long range elastic interactions. Our analysis has implications for general
random rough surfaces, as similar local transitions occur continuously at
detached areas or coalescing contact zones. We show that the probability
density of null contact pressures is non-zero at full contact. This might
suggest revisiting the conditions necessary for applying Persson's model at
partial contacts and guide the comparisons with numerical simulations. We also
address the evaluation of the contact perimeter for discrete geometries and the
applicability of Westergaard's solution for three-dimensional geometries.

ongoing modeling challenges. We propose a hybrid network-patch model for the
spread of mosquito-borne pathogens that accounts for the movement of
individuals through mosquito habitats and responds to environmental factors
such as rainfall and temperature. Our approach extends the capabilities of
existing agent-based models for individual movement developed to predict the
spread of directly transmitted pathogens in populations. To extend to
mosquito-borne disease, agent-based models are coupled with differential
equations representing `clouds' of mosquitoes in geographic patches that
account for mosquito ecology, including heterogeneity in mosquito density,
emergence rates, and extrinsic incubation period. We illustrate the method by
adapting an agent-based model for human movement across a network to
mosquito-borne disease. We investigated the importance of heterogeneity in
mosquito population dynamics and host movement on pathogen transmission,
motivating the utility of detailed models of individual behavior. We observed
that the total number of infected people is greater in heterogeneous patch
models with one high risk patch and high or medium human movement than it would
be in a random mixing homogeneous model. Our hybrid agent-based/differential
equation model is able to quantify the importance of the heterogeneity in
predicting the spread and invasion of mosquito-borne pathogens. Mitigation
strategies can be more effective when guided by realistic models created by
extending the capabilities of existing agent-based models to include

  Equip the space of stationary measures with the weak* topology. When $\mu$

implies that the simplex of $\mu$-stationary measures on $Z^G$ is a Poulsen

  We furthermore show that if the action of $G$ on its Poisson boundary is

  Next, we consider the space of stationary actions, equipped with a standard

(T), the ergodic actions are meager. We also construct a group $G$ without
property (T) such that the ergodic actions are not dense, for some $\mu$.
  Finally, for a weaker topology on the set of actions, which we call the very

assembled summation of a large number of lattice-allocated potentials
represented on 3D $N\times N \times N$ grid with the computational requirements
only \emph{weakly dependent} on the number of summed potentials. It is based on
the assembled low-rank canonical tensor representations of the collected
potentials using pointwise sums of shifted canonical vectors representing the
single generating function, say the Newton kernel. For a sum of electrostatic
potentials over $L\times L \times L$ lattice embedded in a box the required
storage scales linearly in the 1D grid-size, $O(N )$, while the numerical cost
is estimated by $O(N L)$. For periodic boundary conditions, the storage demand
remains proportional to the 1D grid-size of a unit cell, $n=N/L$, while the
numerical cost reduces to $O(N)$, that outperforms the FFT-based Ewald-type
summation algorithms of complexity $O(N^3 \log N)$. The complexity in the grid
parameter $N$ can be reduced even to the logarithmic scale $O(\log N)$ by using
data-sparse representation of canonical $N$-vectors via the quantics tensor
approximation. For justification, we prove an upper bound on the quantics ranks
for the canonical vectors in the overall lattice sum. The presented approach is
beneficial in applications which require further functional calculus with the
lattice potential, say, scalar product with a function, integration or
differentiation, which can be performed easily in tensor arithmetics on large

regulatory networks. Often Boolean networks show very chaotic behaviour which
is sensitive to any small perturbations. In order to reduce the chaotic
behaviour and to attain stability in the gene regulatory network, nested
Canalizing Functions (NCFs) are best suited. NCFs and its variants have a wide
range of applications in systems biology. Previously, many works were done on
the application of canalizing functions, but there were fewer methods to check
if any arbitrary Boolean function is canalizing or not. In this paper, by using
Karnaugh Map this problem is solved and also it has been shown that when the
canalizing functions of variable is given, all the canalizing functions of
variable could be generated by the method of concatenation. In this paper we
have uniquely identified the number of NCFs having a particular Hamming
Distance (H.D) generated by each variable as starting canalizing input.
Partially NCFs of 4 variables has also been studied in this paper.

They
typically breakdown when relevant orthogonal polynomials do not exist. Current
approaches to avoiding breakdown rely on jumping over the non-existent
polynomials to resume computation. This jumping strategy may have to be used
many times during the solution process. We suggest an alternative to jumping
which consists in switching between different algorithms that have been
generated using different recurrence relations between orthogonal polynomials.
This approach can be implemented as three different strategies: ST1, ST2, and
ST3. We shall briefly recall how Lanczos-type algorithms are derived. Four of
the most prominent such algorithms namely $A_4$, $A_{12}$, $A_5/B_{10}$ and
$A_5/B_8$ will be presented and then deployed in the switching framework. In

into them. Using cognitive mapping concepts for DEM registration, has evolved
from this basic idea of using the mapping between the space to objects and
defining their relationships to form the basic landmarks that need to be
marked, stored and manipulated in and about the environment or other candidate
environments, namely, in our case, the DEMs. The progressive two-level
encapsulation of methods of geo-spatial cognition includes landmark knowledge
and layout knowledge and can be useful for DEM registration. Space-based
approach, that emphasizes on explicit extent of the environment under
consideration, and object-based approach, that emphasizes on the relationships
between objects in the local environment being the two paradigms of cognitive
mapping can be methodically integrated in this three-architecture for DEM
registration. Initially, P-model based segmentation is performed followed by
landmark formation for contextual mapping that uses contextual pyramid
formation. Apart from landmarks being used for registration key-point finding,
Euclidean distance based deformation calculation has been used for
transformation and change detection. Landmarks have been categorized to belong
to either being flat-plain areas without much variation in the land heights;
peaks that can be found when there is gradual increase in height as compared to
the flat areas; valleys, marked with gradual decrease in the height seen in
DEM; and finally, ripple areas with very shallow crests and nadirs. Fractal
based compression was used for storage of co-registered DEMs. This method may
further be extended for DEM-topographic map and DEM-to-remote sensed image
registration. Experimental results further cement the fact that DEM
registration may be effectively done using the proposed method.

spherically symmetric spacetime for various alternative gravity theories has
been investigated. For this purpose we have assumed an uniform distribution for
the angular momentum density of the rotating perfect fluid. The contours of
equipotential surfaces are illustrated in order to obtain the nature of inflow
and outflow of matters. It has been noticed that, the marginally stable
circular orbits originating from decreasing angular momentum density lead to
closed equipotential surfaces along with cusp allowing existence of accretion
disks. On the other hand, the growing part of angular momentum density exhibits
central rings for which stable configurations are possible. However inflow of
matter is prohibited. Among the solutions discussed in this work, the charged
$F(R)$ gravity and Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet solution exhibit inflow and
outflow of matter with central rings present. These varied accretion disk
structure of perfect fluid attribute these spacetimes astrophysical importance.
The effect of higher curvature terms predominantly arises from region near the
black hole horizon. Hence the structural difference of accretion disk in
modified gravity theories with comparison to general relativity may act as an
experimental probe for these alternative gravity theories.

without employing any concepts , associated with the time dilatation or/and
length contraction. It yielded the 1-D Lorentz transformation (LT), free of
inconsistencies (inherent in the canonical derivation and interpretations of
the LT). Here we apply the same approach to derive the LT for the 3-dimensional
motion of a particle and the attendant law of velocity composition. As a
result, the infinite set of four-parameter transformations is obtained. The
requirement of linearity of these transformations selects out of this set the
two-parameter subset . The values of the remaining two parameters ,dictated by
physics of the motion, is explicitly determined , yielding the canonical form
of the 3-dimensional LT. The generalized law of velocity composition and the
attendant invariant ( not postulated apriori) of the motion are derived, As in
the one-dimensional case, present derivation, as a whole, does not have any
need in introducing the concepts of the time dilatation and length contraction,
