exact NSVZ $\beta$-function in ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric theories, paying
especial attention to the scheme dependence of the results. It is explained,
how the NSVZ relation is obtained for the renormalization group functions
defined in terms of the bare coupling constant if a theory is regularized by
higher derivatives. Also we describe, how to construct a special
renormalization prescription which gives the NSVZ relation for the
renormalization group functions defined in terms of the renormalized coupling
constant exactly in all orders for Abelian supersymmetric theories, regularized
by higher derivatives. The scheme dependence of the NSVZ $\beta$-function (for
the renormalization group functions defined in terms of the renormalized
coupling constant) is discussed in the non-Abelian case. It is shown that in
this case the NSVZ $\beta$-function leads to a certain scheme-independent
equality.

xenon (LXe) are currently the most sensitive detectors searching for
interactions of WIMP dark matter in a laboratory-based experiment. This is
achieved by combining a large, monolithic dark matter target of a very low
background with the capability to localize the interaction vertex in three
dimensions, allowing for target fiducialization and multiple-scatter rejection.
The background in dual-phase LXe TPCs is further reduced by the simultaneous
measurement of the scintillation and ionization signal from a particle
interaction, which is used to distinguish signal from background signatures.
This article reviews the principle of dual-phase LXe TPCs, and provides an
overview about running as well as future experimental efforts.

before 2004, multi-curve setup after 2004), and make two standardisation
proposals: for data; and for Data-Models. VAR and ES are required for lifetime
portfolio calculations, i.e. collateral calls, which cover a wide range of
market states. Hence we need standard, i.e. clean, complete, and common (i.e.
identical for all banks), market data also covering this wide range of market
states. This data is historically incomplete and not clean hence data
standardization is required. Stressed VAR and ES require moving market
movements during a past (usually not recent) window to current, and future,
market states. All choices (e.g. absolute difference, relative, relative scaled
by some function of market states) implicitly define a Data Model for
transformation of extreme market moves (recall that 99th percentiles are
typical, and the behaviour of the rest is irrelevant). Hence we propose
standard Data Models. These are necessary because different banks have
different stress windows. Where there is no data, or a requirement for
simplicity, we propose standard lookup tables (one per window, etc.). Without
this standardization of data and Data Models we demonstrate that VAR and ES are
complex derivatives of subjective choices.

the variation of the net gain along branches of steady-state solutions of the

qualitative agreement between numerical simulations and the measured

of branes of codimension higher than one, we consider a specific regularization
of the internal structure of the branes where the 5D brane can be considered
thin with respect to the 4D one. We consider the solutions corresponding to
pure tension sources on the 4D brane, and study perturbations at first order
around these background solutions. We adopt a 4D scalar-vector-tensor
decomposition, and focus on the scalar sector of perturbations. We show that,
in a suitable 4D limit, the trace part of the 4D metric perturbations obeys a
decoupled equation which suggests that it is a ghost for background tensions
smaller than a critical tension, while it is a healthy field otherwise. We give
a geometrical interpretation of the existence of the critical tension and of
the reason why the relevant field is a ghost or not depending on the background
tension. We however find a value of the critical tension which is different
from the one already found in the literature. Differently from the results in
the literature, our analysis implies that, choosing the background tension
suitably, we can construct ghost-free models for any value of the free
parameters of the theory. We suggest that the difference lies in the procedure
used to evaluate the pillbox integration across the codimension-2 brane. We
confirm the validity of our analysis by performing numerically the integration
in a particular case where the solution inside the thick cod-2 brane is known
exactly. We stress that the singular structure of the perturbation fields in
the nested branes set-ups is very subtle, and that great care has to be taken

can be a few nanoseconds. We discuss the optimization of initialization,
read-out, and single-spin gates through suitable choices of detuning pulses and
an improved geometry. We also examine the effect of nuclear dephasing and

Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP) algorithms. While essentially all SSSP
algorithm only scan edges forward, the new algorithm scans some edges backward.
The new algorithm assumes that edges in the outgoing and incoming adjacency
lists of the vertices appear in non-decreasing order of weight. (Spira's
algorithm makes the same assumption about the outgoing adjacency lists, but
does not use incoming adjacency lists.) The running time of the algorithm on a
complete directed graph on $n$ vertices with independent exponential edge
weights is $O(n)$, with very high probability. This improves on the previously
best result of $O(n\log n)$, which is best possible if only forward scans are
allowed, exhibiting an interesting separation between forward-only and
forward-backward SSSP algorithms. As a consequence, we also get a new all-pairs
shortest paths algorithm. The expected running time of the algorithm on
complete graphs with independent exponential edge weights is $O(n^2)$, matching
a recent algorithm of Demetrescu and Italiano as analyzed by Peres et al.
Furthermore, the probability that the new algorithm requires more than $O(n^2)$
time is exponentially small, improving on the $O(n^{-1/26})$ probability bound

the Lifschitz tails. The latter, in the linear approximation, is related to the
spectral density of the Laplacian matrix and to the time dependent order
parameter. I show that these approximations indicate correctly Griffiths Phases
both on regular one-dimensional lattices and on small world networks exhibiting
purely topological disorder. I discuss the localization transition that occurs

""divide and conquer"" approach. The mixture of experts (MOE) technique makes use
of this strategy by joinly training a set of classifiers, or experts, that are
specialized in different regions of the input space. A global model, or gate
function, complements the experts by learning a function that weights their
relevance in different parts of the input space. Local feature selection
appears as an attractive alternative to improve the specialization of experts

main intuition is that particular subsets of dimensions, or subspaces, are
usually more appropriate to classify instances located in different regions of
the input space. Accordingly, this work contributes with a regularized variant

regularized using an extension of the McGehee method. As an example, we apply
these results to causal geodesics in the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\""om

extension of both spacetimes can be described by a single two-dimensional phase

optical surface are studied. We find in all of our 3D RHD simulations stellar
granulation patterns imprinted, which are qualitatively similar to the solar

a large range in size, which can be divided into two groups - smaller and
larger granules - by the mean granule size. These are distinct in their
properties: smaller granules are regular shaped and dimmer, while the larger
ones are increasingly irregular and more complex in their shapes and
distribution in intensity contrast. This is reflected in their fractal
dimensions, which is close to unity for the smaller granules, and close to two

systems are becoming accessible to observations. Here, we analyze and classify
different types of spin-orbit evolution in compact multiplanet systems

secular theory, using a vectorial approach developed in a separate paper. When
planet-planet perturbations are truncated at the second order in eccentricity
and mutual inclination, and the planet-companion perturbations are developed at
the quadrupole order, the problem becomes integrable. The motion is composed of
a uniform precession of the whole system around the total angular momentum, and
in the rotating frame, the evolution is periodic. Here, we focus on the
relative motion associated to the oscillations of the inclination between the
planet system and the outer orbit, and of the obliquities of the star with
respect to the two orbital planes. The solution is obtained using a powerful
geometric method. With this technique, we identify four different regimes
characterized by the nutation amplitude of the stellar spin-axis relative to
the orbital plane of the planets. In particular, the obliquity of the star
reaches its maximum when the system is in the Cassini regime where planets have
more angular momentum than the star, and where the precession rate of the star
is similar to that of the planets induced by the companion. In that case,
spin-orbit oscillations exceed twice the inclination between the planets and
the companion. Even if mutual inclination is only ~ 20 deg, this resonant case
can cause the spin-orbit angle to oscillate between perfectly aligned and
retrograde values.

can undermine the ApEn discrimination capacity. In this work we show that
$r_{max}$ ($ApEn(m,r_{max},N)=ApEn_{max}$) can also be used as a feature to
discern between dynamics. Moreover, the combined use of $ApEn_{max}$ and
$r_{max}$ allows a better discrimination capacity to be accomplished, even in
the presence of noise. We conducted our studies using real physiological time

provides additional information that can be useful for classification purposes.

proven theorems. Answering this question for quantum many-body systems poses a
challenge for the present. In this work we address this issue by deriving the
stochastic equations for the reduced system with self-consistent backaction
from the two baths, calculating the energy flow from one bath to the chain to
the other bath, and exhibiting a power balance relation in the total (chain +
baths) system which testifies to the existence of a NESS in this system at late
times. Its insensitivity to the initial conditions of the chain corroborates to
its uniqueness. The functional method we adopt here entails the use of the
influence functional, the coarse-grained and stochastic effective actions, from
which one can derive the stochastic equations and calculate the average values
of physical variables in open quantum systems. This involves both taking the
expectation values of quantum operators of the system and the distributional
averages of stochastic variables stemming from the coarse-grained environment.
This method though formal in appearance is compact and complete. It can also
easily accommodate perturbative techniques and diagrammatic methods from field
theory. Taken all together it provides a solid platform for carrying out

We explore the outer Galactic disc up to a Galactocentric distance of
30 kpc to derive its parameters and measure the magnitude of its flare.
  Methods. We obtained the 3D density of stars of type F8V-G5V with a colour
selection from extinction-corrected photometric data of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey - Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration
(SDSS-SEGUE) over 1,400 deg^2 in off-plane low Galactic latitude regions and
fitted it to a model of flared thin+thick disc.
  Results. The best-fit parameters are a thin-disc scale length of 2.0 kpc, a
thin-disc scale height at solar Galactocentric distance of 0.24 kpc, a
thick-disc scale length of 2.5 kpc, and a thick-disc scale height at solar
Galactocentric distance of 0.71 kpc. We derive a flaring in both discs that
causes the scale height of the average disc to be multiplied with respect to
the solar neighbourhood value by a factor of 3.3^{+2.2}_{-1.6} at R=15 kpc and
by a factor of 12^{+20}_{-7} at R=25 kpc.
  Conclusions. The flare is quite prominent at large R and its presence
explains the apparent depletion of in-plane stars that are often confused with
a cut-off at R>15 kpc. Indeed, our Galactic disc does not present a truncation
or abrupt fall-off there, but the stars are spread in off-plane regions, even
at z of several kpc for R>20 kpc. Moreover, the smoothness of the observed
stellar distribution also suggests that there is a continuous structure and not
a combination of a Galactic disc plus some other substructure or extragalactic
component: the hypothesis to interpret the Monoceros ring in terms of a tidal
stream of a putative accreted dwarf galaxy is not only unnecessary because the
observed flare explains the overdensity in the Monoceros ring observed in SDSS
fields, but it appears to be inappropriate.

Background via neutrino capture on tritium, taking the proposed PTOLEMY

\sim$ 0.15 eV, the experiment will be sensitive to neutrino masses with
degenerate spectrum, $m_1 \simeq m_2 \simeq m_3 = m_\nu \gtrsim 0.1$ eV. These
neutrinos are non-relativistic today; detecting them would be a unique
opportunity to probe this unexplored kinematical regime. The signature of
neutrino capture is a peak in the electron spectrum that is displaced by $2
m_{\nu}$ above the beta decay endpoint. The signal would exceed the background
from beta decay if the energy resolution is $\Delta \lesssim 0.7 m_\nu $.
Interestingly, the total capture rate depends on the origin of the neutrino
mass, being $\Gamma^{\rm D} \simeq 4$ and $\Gamma^{\rm M} \simeq 8$ events per
year (for a 100 g tritium target) for unclustered Dirac and Majorana neutrinos,
respectively. An enhancement of the rate of up to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ is expected
due to gravitational clustering, with the unique potential to probe the local
overdensity of neutrinos. Turning to more exotic neutrino physics, PTOLEMY
could be sensitive to a lepton asymmetry, and reveal the eV-scale sterile
neutrino that is favored by short baseline oscillation searches. The experiment
would also be sensitive to a neutrino lifetime on the order of the age of the
universe and break the degeneracy between neutrino mass and lifetime which
affects existing bounds.

the demands of service are higher than the supplies, and many point and fluid
queue models have been proposed to study such queueing systems. However, there
has been no unified approach to deriving such models, analyzing their
relationships and properties, and extending them for networks. In this paper,
we derive point queue models as limits of two link-based queueing model: the
link transmission model and a link queue model. With two definitions for demand
and supply of a point queue, we present four point queue models, four
approximate models, and their discrete versions. We discuss the properties of
these models, including equivalence, well-definedness, smoothness, and queue
spillback, both analytically and with numerical examples. We then analytically
solve Vickrey's point queue model and stationary states in various models. We
demonstrate that all existing point and fluid queue models in the literature
are special cases of those derived from the link-based queueing models. Such a
unified approach leads to systematic methods for studying the queueing process
at a point facility and will also be helpful for studies on stochastic queues
as well as networks of queues.

studied, using an equation of state like $P = - \frac{B}{\rho}$, where $B =
B_{0}V^{-\frac{n}{3}}$. Here $B_{0}$ is a positive universal constant, $n$ is
also a constant and $V$ is the volume of the fluid. From the consideration of
thermodynamic stability, it is seen that only if the values of $n$ are allowed
to be negative, then $(\frac{\partial P}{\partial V})_{S} <0$ throughout the
evolution. Again thermal capacity at constant volume $c_{V}$ shows positive
expression. Using the best fit value of $ n = -3.4$ as previously found by Guo
\emph{et al} \cite{guo1} gives that the fluid is thermodynamically stable
through out the evolution. The effective equation of state for the special case
of, $n = 0$ goes to $\Lambda$CDM model. Again for $n <0$ it favours
phantom-like cosmology which is in agreement with the current SNe Ia
constraints like VCG model. The deceleration parameter is also studied in the
context of thermodynamics and the analysis shows that the \emph{flip} occurs
for the value of $ n < 4$. Finally the thermal equation of state is discussed
which is an explicit function of temperature only. It is also observed that the
third law of thermodynamics is satisfied in this model. As expected the volume
increases as temperature falls during adiabatic expansions. In this case, for $
T \rightarrow 0$, the thermal equation of state reduces to $(- 1 +
\frac{n}{6})$ which is identical with the equation of state for the case of
large volume.

prompt emission spectra in scenarios of efficient neutrino production. By
assuming a fiducial GRB spectrum and a power-law proton distribution extending
to ultra-high energies, we calculate the proton cooling rate and the neutrino
emission produced through photopion processes. For this, we employ a numerical
code that follows the formation of the hadronic cascade by taking into account
non-linear feedback effects, such as the evolution of the target photon field
itself due to the contribution of secondary particles. We show that in cases of
efficient proton cooling and subsequently efficient high-energy neutrino
production, the emission from the hadronic cascade distorts and may even
dominate the GRB spectrum. Taking this into account, we constrain the allowable
values of the ratio $\eta_p=L_p/L_{\gamma}$, where $L_{p}$ and $L_{\gamma}$ are
the isotropic equivalent proton and prompt gamma-ray luminosities. For the
highest value of $\eta_{p}$ that does not lead to the dominance of the
cascading emission, we then calculate the maximum neutrino luminosity from a
single burst and show that it ranges between $(0.01- 0.6)L_{p}$ and
$(0.5-1.4)L_{\gamma}$ for various parameter sets. We discuss possible
implications of other parameters, such as the magnetic field strength and the
shape of the initial gamma-ray spectrum, on our results. Finally, we compare
the upper limit on $\eta_p$ derived here with various studies in the field, and
we point out the necessity of a self-consistent treatment of the hadronic
emission in order to avoid erroneously high neutrino fluxes from GRB models.

morphological features closely matching the observed excess arises from a
population of cosmic ray protons in the inner Galaxy, and provide proof of
principle and arguments for the existence of such a population, most likely
originating from local supernova remnants. Specifically, the ""Galactic center

to mega-year old injection episodes, continuous or impulsive. We conclude that

due to their lack of symmetry-breaking order parameters and intrinsic
topological orders. For this reason, it is impossible to formulate SPTs under
Ginzburg-Landau theory or probe SPTs via fractionalized bulk excitations and
topology-dependent ground state degeneracy. However, the partition functions
from path integrals with various symmetry twists are the universal SPT
invariants defining topological probe responses, fully characterizing SPTs. In
this work, we use gauge fields to represent those symmetry twists in closed
spacetimes of any dimensionality and arbitrary topology. This allows us to
express the SPT invariants in terms of continuum field theory. We show that SPT
invariants of pure gauge actions describe the SPTs predicted by group
cohomology, while the mixed gauge-gravity actions describe the
beyond-group-cohomology SPTs, recently observed by Kapustin. We find new
examples of mixed gauge-gravity actions for U(1) SPTs in 4+1D via mixing the
gauge first Chern class with a gravitational Chern-Simons term, or viewed as a
5+1D Wess-Zumino-Witten term with a Pontryagin class. We rule out U(1) SPTs in
3+1D mixed with a Stiefel-Whitney class. We also apply our approach to the
bosonic/fermionic topological insulators protected by U(1) charge and
$\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ time-reversal symmetries whose pure gauge action is the axion
$\theta$-term. Field theory representations of SPT invariants not only serve as
tools for classifying SPTs, but also guide us in designing physical probes for
them. In addition, our field theory representations are independently powerful
for studying group cohomology within the mathematical context.

highly controversial issue. We investigate jointly several constraints on the
distance scale r and Lorentz factor Gamma of the gamma-ray emitting regions in
luminous blazars (primarily flat spectrum radio quasars, FSRQs). Working in the
framework of one-zone external radiation Comptonization (ERC) models, we
perform a parameter space study for several representative cases of actual
gamma-ray flares in their multiwavelength context. We find a particularly
useful combination of three constraints: from an upper limit on the collimation
parameter Gamma*theta <~ 1, from an upper limit on the synchrotron self-Compton
(SSC) luminosity L_SSC <~ L_X, and from an upper limit on the efficient cooling
photon energy E_cool,obs <~ 100 MeV. These three constraints are particularly
strong for sources with low accretion disk luminosity L_d. The commonly used
intrinsic pair-production opacity constraint on Gamma is usually much weaker
than the SSC constraint. The SSC and cooling constraints provide a robust lower
limit on the collimation parameter Gamma*theta >~ 0.1 - 0.7. Typical values of
r corresponding to moderate values of Gamma ~ 20 are in the range 0.1 - 1 pc,
and are determined primarily by the observed variability time scale t_var,obs.
Alternative scenarios motivated by the observed gamma-ray/mm connection, in
which gamma-ray flares of t_var,obs ~ a few days are located at r ~ 10 pc, are
in conflict with both the SSC and cooling constraints. Moreover, we use a
simple light travel time argument to point out that the gamma-ray/mm connection
does not provide a significant constraint on the location of gamma-ray flares.
We argue that spine-sheath models of the jet structure do not offer a plausible
alternative to external radiation fields at large distances, however, an
extended broad-line region is an idea worth exploring.

abundance, the compositions of such planets are largely unknown. The available
evidence suggests that they range in composition from small, high-density rocky
planets to low-density planets consisting of rocky cores surrounded by thick
hydrogen and helium gas envelopes. Understanding the transition from the
gaseous planets to Earth-like rocky worlds is important to estimate the number
of potentially habitable planets in our Galaxy and provide constraints on
planet formation theories. Here we report the abundances of heavy elements
(that is, the metallicities) of more than 400 stars hosting 600 exoplanet
candidates, and find that the exoplanets can be categorized into three
populations defined by statistically distinct (~ 4.5{\sigma}) metallicity
regions. We interpret these regions as reflecting the formation regimes of
terrestrial-like planets (radii less than 1.7 Earth radii), gas dwarf planets
with rocky cores and hydrogen-helium envelopes (radii between 1.7 and 3.9 Earth
radii) and ice or gas giant planets (radii greater than 3.9 Earth radii). These
transitions correspond well with those inferred from dynamical mass estimates,
implying that host star metallicity, which is a proxy for the initial solid
inventory of the protoplanetary disk, is a key ingredient regulating the

present an exploratory study to assess the impact of the proposed IMF evolution
on the statistical galaxy properties, as predicted by the Semi-Analytical model

dependencies for the IMF shape, as a function of both model galaxy properties

environment, and compare the predicted stellar mass functions and star
formation rate functions with reference runs at fixed IMF. In most cases,
MORGANA predictions show deviations of the order of a few tenths of dex with
respect to a run assuming an Universal Kroupa IMF. Among the proposed IMF
variations, an increasing Top-Heavy IMF at increasing star formation rates has
the largest impact on predicted galaxy properties, while most of the models
assuming an increasing Bottom-Heavy IMF at higher masses/velocity dispersion
lead to variations in galaxy properties that are of the same order as the
uncertainty on the mass and star formation rate determination. By comparing the
predicted galaxy stellar mass functions, we conclude that the study of the
high-mass end can provide useful constraints to disentangle models assuming an

planets orbiting M-dwarf stars in the habitable zone using a set of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. The stellar wind solution is used to drive a
model for the planetary magnetosphere, which is coupled with a model for the
planetary ionosphere. Our simulations reveal that the space environment around
close-in habitable planets is extreme, and the stellar wind plasma conditions
change from sub- to super-Alfvenic along the planetary orbit. As a result, the
magnetospheric structure changes dramatically with a bow shock forming in the
super-Alfvenic sectors, while no bow shock forms in the sub-Alfvenic sectors.
The planets reside most of the time in the sub-Alfvenic sectors with poor
atmospheric protection. A significant amount of Joule Heating is provided at
the top of the atmosphere as a result of the planetary interaction with the
stellar wind. For the steady-state solution, the heating is about 0.1-3\% of
the total incoming stellar irradiation, and it is enhanced by 50\% for the
time-dependent case. The significant Joule Heating obtained here should be
considered in models for the atmospheres of habitable planets in terms of the
thickness of the atmosphere, the top-side temperature and density, the boundary
conditions for the atmospheric pressure, and particle radiation and transport.

$\Theta(n^2)$ steps to find a stable marriage in the worst case, but only
$\Theta(n \log n)$ steps in the average case (with $n$ women and $n$ men). In
1976, Knuth asked whether the worst-case running time can be improved in a
model of computation that does not require sequential access to the whole
input. A partial negative answer was given by Ng and Hirschberg, who showed
that $\Theta(n^2)$ queries are required in a model that allows certain natural
random-access queries to the participants' preferences. A significantly more
general - albeit slightly weaker - lower bound follows from Segal's general
analysis of communication complexity, namely that $\Omega(n^2)$ Boolean queries
are required in order to find a stable marriage, regardless of the set of
allowed Boolean queries.
  Using a reduction to the communication complexity of the disjointness
problem, we give a far simpler, yet significantly more powerful argument
showing that $\Omega(n^2)$ Boolean queries of any type are indeed required for
finding a stable - or even an approximately stable - marriage. Notably, unlike
Segal's lower bound, our lower bound generalizes also to (A) randomized
algorithms, (B) allowing arbitrary separate preprocessing of the women's
preferences profile and of the men's preferences profile, (C) several variants
of the basic problem, such as whether a given pair is married in every/some
stable marriage, and (D) determining whether a proposed marriage is stable or
far from stable. In order to analyze ""approximately stable"" marriages, we
introduce the notion of ""distance to stability"" and provide an efficient
algorithm for its computation.

to recover dynamic magnetic resonance images from undersampled measurements. We
introduce a generalized formulation that is capable of handling a wide class of
sparsity/compactness priors on the deformation corrected dynamic signal. In
this work, we consider example compactness priors such as sparsity in temporal
Fourier domain, sparsity in temporal finite difference domain, and nuclear norm
penalty to exploit low rank structure. Using variable splitting, we decouple
the complex optimization problem to simpler and well understood sub problems;
the resulting algorithm alternates between simple steps of shrinkage based
denoising, deformable registration, and a quadratic optimization step.
Additionally, we employ efficient continuation strategies to minimize the risk
of convergence to local minima. The proposed formulation contrasts with
existing DC-CS schemes that are customized for free breathing cardiac cine
applications, and other schemes that rely on fully sampled reference frames or
navigator signals to estimate the deformation parameters. The efficient
decoupling enabled by the proposed scheme allows its application to a wide
range of applications including contrast enhanced dynamic MRI. Through
experiments on numerical phantom and in vivo myocardial perfusion MRI datasets,
we demonstrate the utility of the proposed DC-CS scheme in providing robust
reconstructions with reduced motion artifacts over classical compressed sensing
schemes that utilize the compact priors on the original deformation
un-corrected signal.

and quarks are tiny, providing an important window to observe new physics.
Theories beyond the SM typically allow relatively large EDMs. The EDMs depend
on the relative phases of terms in the effective Lagrangian of the extended
theory, which are generally unknown. Underlying theories, such as
string/M-theories compactified to four dimensions, could predict the phases and
thus EDMs in the resulting supersymmetric (SUSY) theory. Earlier one of us,
with collaborators, made such a prediction and found, unexpectedly, that the
phases were predicted to be zero at tree level in the theory at the unification
or string scale $\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{16}$ GeV). Electroweak (EW) scale EDMs
still arise via running from the high scale, and depend only on the SM Yukawa
couplings that also give the CKM phase. Here we extend the earlier work by
studying the dependence of the low scale EDMs on the constrained but not fully
known fundamental Yukawa couplings. The dominant contribution is from two loop
diagrams and is not sensitive to the choice of Yukawa texture. The electron EDM
should not be found to be larger than about $ 5\times 10^{-30} e$ cm, and the
neutron EDM should not be larger than about $5\times 10^{-29}e$ cm. These
values are quite a bit smaller than the reported predictions from Split SUSY
and typical effective theories, but much larger than the Standard Model
prediction. Also, since models with random phases typically give much larger
EDMs, it is a significant testable prediction of compactified M-theory that the
EDMs should not be above these upper limits. The actual EDMs can be below the
limits, so once they are measured they could provide new insight into the
fundamental Yukawa couplings of leptons and quarks. We comment also on the role
of strong CP violation. EDMs probe fundamental physics near the Planck scale.

surface Majorana fermions. Localization corrections to surface transport
coefficients vanish due to time-reversal symmetry (TRS). We argue that
Altshuler-Aronov interaction corrections vanish because TRS forbids color or
spin Friedel oscillations. We confirm this within a perturbative expansion in
the interactions, and to lowest order in a large-$|\nu|$ expansion. In both

separate fashion. In contrast to this traditional separation, this manuscript
points out and demonstrates the utility of an important but largely unremarked
common thread running through many prominent optimization methods. In
particular, we show that methods such as successive orthogonal projection,
gradient descent, projected gradient descent, the proximal-point method,
forward-backward splitting, the alternating direction method of multipliers,
and under- or over-relaxed variants of the preceding all involve updates that
are of a common type --- namely, the updates satisfy a property known as
pseudocontractivity. Moreover, since the property of pseudocontractivity is
preserved under both composition and convex combination, updates constructed
via these operations from pseudocontractive updates are themselves
pseudocontractive. Having demonstrated that pseudocontractive updates are to be
found in many optimization methods, we then provide a unified basic analysis of
methods with pseudocontractive updates. Specifically, we prove a novel bound
satisfied by the norm of the difference in iterates of pseudocontractive
updates and we then use this bound to establish that the error criterion
$\left\Vert x^{N}-Tx^{N}\right\Vert ^{2}$ is $o(1/N)$ for any method involving
pseudocontractive updates (where $N$ is the number of iterations and $T$ is the

can be explained as a superposition of pristine neutral interstellar He gas and
an additional population of neutral He that we call the Warm Breeze. The Warm
Breeze is approximately two-fold slower and 2.5 times warmer than the primary
interstellar He population, and its density in front of the heliosphere is ~7%
that of the neutral interstellar helium. The inflow direction of the Warm
Breeze differs by ~19deg from the inflow direction of interstellar gas. The
Warm Breeze seems a long-term feature of the heliospheric environment. It has
not been detected earlier because it is strongly ionized inside the
heliosphere, which brings it below the threshold of detection via pickup ion
and heliospheric backscatter glow observations, as well as by the direct
sampling of GAS/Ulysses. Possible sources for the Warm Breeze include (1) the
secondary population of interstellar helium, created via charge exchange and
perhaps elastic scattering of neutral interstellar He atoms on interstellar He+
ions in the outer heliosheath, or (2) a gust of interstellar He originating
from a hypothetic wave train in the Local Interstellar Cloud. A secondary
population is expected from models, but the characteristics of the Warm Breeze
do not fully conform to modeling results. If, nevertheless, this is the
explanation, IBEX-Lo observations of the Warm Breeze provide key insights into
the physical state of plasma in the outer heliosheath. If the second hypothesis
is true, the source is likely to be located within a few thousand of AU from
the Sun, which is the propagation range of possible gusts of interstellar
neutral helium with the Warm Breeze characteristics against dissipation via
elastic scattering in the Local Cloud.

  The dynamics of stock prices generated by the model, with and without the
uptick-rule restriction, are analyzed by pairing the classical fundamental
prediction with beliefs based on both linear and nonlinear technical analyses.
The comparison shows a reduction of downward price movements of undervalued
shares when the short selling restriction is imposed. This gives evidence that
the uptick rule meets its intended objective. However, the effects of the short
selling regulation fade when the intensity of choice to switch trading
strategies is high. The analysis suggests possible side effects of the

study a learning variant of these problems, where the model of the problem is
unknown and has to be learned by interacting repeatedly with the environment in
the bandit setting. We formalize our learning problem quite generally, as
learning how to maximize an unknown modular function on a known polymatroid. We
propose a computationally efficient algorithm for solving our problem and bound
its expected cumulative regret. Our gap-dependent upper bound is tight up to a
constant and our gap-free upper bound is tight up to polylogarithmic factors.
Finally, we evaluate our method on three problems and demonstrate that it is
practical.

compressible layer is examined via computational simulations in two different
geometries, axisymmetric cylinders and two dimensional, planar slabs. For
simplicity, an ideal gas equation of state is used with a pressure-dependent
reaction rate that results in a stable detonation wave structure. The
detonation is initiated as an ideal Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) detonation with a
one-dimensional structure, and then allowed to propagate into a finite diameter
or thickness layer of explosive surrounded by an inert layer. The yielding
confinement of the inert layer results in the detonation wave decaying to a
sub-CJ steady state velocity or failing entirely. Simulations are performed
with different values of the reaction rate pressure exponent (n = 2 and 3) and
different impedance confinement (greater than, less than, and equal to the
confinement of the explosive). The velocity decrement and critical dimension
(critical diameter or thickness) are determined, and a 2:1 scaling between the
cylinder diameter and slab thickness results is confirmed, in good agreement
with curvature-based models of detonation propagation. The measured shock front
curvature and detonation velocity relation agrees with the classic model of
Wood and Kirkwood. The computational simulations are compared to a simple,
analytic model that treats the interaction of the confinement with the
detonation products via Newtonian theory and a model that assumes a continuous
variation in shock front curvature with the shock angle at the interface with
the confinement matching the angle determined by shock polar analysis. The
Newtonian model works very well for the case of high impedance confinement,
while the shock front curvature model agrees with the simulations for the case
of low impedance confinement.

  We introduce quasi-exceptional domains by allowing the boundary values to be
different constants on each boundary component. This relaxed definition retains
the interesting property of being an \emph{arclength quadrature domain}, and
also preserves the connection to the hollow vortex problem in fluid dynamics.
We give a partial classification of such domains in terms of certain Abelian

quasi-exceptional domains. These examples generalize the hollow vortex array
found by Baker, Saffman, and Sheffield (1976). A degeneration of regions of

conditions under which the mean curvature flow supported on a hypersphere with
exterior Dirichlet boundary exists globally in time and converges to a minimal
surface, and secondly, to illustrate the application of Killing vector fields
in the preservation of graphicality for the mean curvature flow with free
boundary. To this end we focus on the mean curvature flow of a topological
annulus with inner boundary meeting a standard n-sphere in \R^{n+1}
perpendicularly and outer boundary fixed to an (n-1)-sphere with radius R>1 at
a fixed height h. We call this the \emph{sphere problem}. Our work is set in
the context of graphical mean curvature flow with either symmetry or mean
concavity/convexity restrictions. For rotationally symmetric initial data we
obtain, depending on the exact configuration of the initial graph, either long
time existence and convergence to a minimal hypersurface with boundary or the
development of a finite-time curvature singularity. With reflectively symmetric
initial data we are able to use Killing vector fields to preserve graphicality
of the flow and uniformly bound the mean curvature pointwise along the flow.
Finally we prove that the mean curvature flow of an initially mean
concave/convex graphical surface exists globally in time and converges to a
piece of a minimal surface.

uncertainty in the locational marginal prices. We propose a very simple
algorithm termed Online Modified Greedy (OMG) algorithm for this problem. A
stylized analysis for the algorithm is performed, which shows that comparing to
the optimal cost of the corresponding stochastic control problem, the
sub-optimality of OMG is bounded and approaches zero in various scenarios. This
suggests that, albeit simple, OMG is guaranteed to have good performance in
some cases; and in other cases, OMG together with the sub-optimality bound can
be used to provide a lower bound for the optimal cost. Such a lower bound can
be valuable in evaluating other heuristic algorithms. For the latter cases, a
semidefinite program is derived to minimize the sub-optimality bound of OMG.
Numerical experiments are conducted to verify our theoretical analysis and to
demonstrate the use of the algorithm.

perform finite-element-method (FEM) simulations to determine the current and

For current capacities of 2-5 kA (peak), power cables are assembled from a
relatively small number of MgB2 strands. The performance of such cables
strongly depends on the current and field distributions, which are in turn
influenced by the number and the arrangement of the superconducting components

important insights for optimizing the cable's design. The numerical model

Fock noise (that, quantum input processes in a coherent state) and where the
output is mixed with a squeezed signal. It also applies to the case of a system
driven by squeezed noise, but here there is a physical restriction to
emission/absorption coupling only. For the special case of a cavity mode where
the dynamics is linear, we are able to derive explicitly the filtered estimate
$\pi_t (a)$ for the mode annihilator $a$ based on the homodyne quadrature
observations up to time $t$.

  Recognition","4 pages",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Speech therapy consists in a wide range of services whose aim is to prevent,
diagnose and treat different types of speech impairments. One of the most
important conditions for obtaining favourable and steady results is the
""immersing"" of the subject as long as possible into therapeutic context: at
home, at school/work, on the street. Since nowadays portable computers tend to
become habitual accessories, it seems a good idea to create virtual versions of
human SLTs and to integrate them into these devices. However one of the main
distinctions between a Speech and Language Therapist (SLT) and a Computer Based
Speech Therapy System (CBST) arise from the field of emotion intelligence. The
inability of current CBSTs to detect emotional state of human subjects leads to
inadequate behavioural responses. Furthermore, this ""unresponsive"" behaviour is
perceived as a lack of empathy and, especially when subjects are children,
leads to negative emotional state such as frustration. Thus in this article we
propose an original emotions recognition framework - named PhonEM - to be
integrated in our previous developed CBST - Logomon. The originality consists
in both emotions representation (a fuzzy model) and detection (using only
subjects' speech stream). These exceptional restrictions along with the fuzzy
representation of emotions lie at the origin of our approach and make our task
a difficult and, in the same time, an innovative one. As far as we know, this
is the first attempt to combine these techniques in order to improve assisted
speech therapy and the obtained results encourage as to further develop our
CBST.

section of the ice to estimate the penetration depth and radiation dose, and in
the past, gas phase cross section values were used as an approximation. We aim
to estimate the VUV absorption cross section of molecular ice components. Pure
ices composed of CO, H2O, CH3OH, NH3, or H2S were deposited at 8 K. The column
density of the ice samples was measured in situ by infrared spectroscopy in
transmittance. VUV spectra of the ice samples were collected in the 120-160 nm
(10.33-7.74 eV) range using a commercial microwave-discharged hydrogen flow
lamp. We provide VUV absorption cross sections of the reported molecular ices.
Our results agree with those previously reported for H2O and NH3 ices.
Vacuum-UV absorption cross section of CH3OH, CO, and H2S in solid phase are
reported for the first time. H2S presents the highest absorption in the 120-160
nm range. Our method allows fast and readily available VUV spectroscopy of ices
without the need to use a synchrotron beamline. We found that the ice
absorption cross sections can be very different from the gas-phase values, and
therefore, our data will significantly improve models that simulate the VUV
photoprocessing and photodesorption of ice mantles. Photodesorption rates of
pure ices, expressed in molecules per absorbed photon, can be derived from our
data.

Sobolev with exact integration (vmSEI) method for analyzing UV wind resonance
lines in hot, massive stars, and ii) derive simple correction factors to the
line force driving the outflows of such stars. We show that (for a given
ionization factor) UV resonance doublets may be used to analytically predict
the upward corrections in empirically inferred mass-loss rates associated with
porosity in velocity space (a.k.a. velocity-porosity, or vorosity), but that
severe solution degeneracies exist. For an inter-clump density set to 1 % of
the mean density, we for O and B supergiants derive upward empirical mass-loss
corrections of typically factors of either ~5 or ~50, depending on which of the
two applicable solutions is chosen. Overall, our results indicate this solution
dichotomy severely limits the use of UV resonance lines as direct mass-loss
indicators of clumped hot stellar winds. We next apply the effective-opacity
formalism to the standard CAK theory of line-driven winds. By analytic and
numerical hydrodynamics calculations, we show that in cases where vorosity is
important at the critical point setting the mass-loss rate, the reduced
line-force leads to a lower theoretical mass loss, by a factor scaling with the
normalized velocity filling factor fvel. On the other hand, if vorosity is
important only above this critical point, the predicted mass loss is not
affected, but the wind terminal speed is reduced. This shows that porosity in
velocity space can have a significant impact not only on the diagnostics, but
also on the dynamics and theory of radiatively driven winds.

ground towards the widespread use of FRET as a ""spectroscopic ruler"" for the
determination of nanometer-scale distances in biomolecules. The underlying
mechanism is a coherent dipole-dipole coupling between particles, as already
recognized in the early days of quantum mechanics, but this coherence was not
directly observed so far. Here, we study, both spectroscopically and in the
time domain, the coherent, dipolar-induced exchange of electronic excitations
between two single Rydberg atoms separated by a controlled distance as large as
15 microns, and brought into resonance by applying a small electric field. The
coherent oscillation of the system between two degenerate pair states occurs at
a frequency that scales as the inverse third power of the distance, the
hallmark of dipole-dipole interactions. Our results not only demonstrate, at
the most fundamental level of two atoms, the basic mechanism underlying FRET,
but also open exciting prospects for active tuning of strong, coherent

encoders cooperate via a finite-capacity one-sided link is considered. The
coordination-capacity region is derived by combining several source coding
techniques, such as Wyner-Ziv (WZ) coding, binning and superposition coding.
Furthermore, a semi-deterministic (SD) broadcast channel (BC) with one-sided
decoder cooperation is considered. Duality principles relating the two problems
are presented, and the capacity region for the SD-BC setting is derived. The
direct part follows from an achievable region for a general BC that is tight
for the SD scenario. A converse is established by using telescoping identities.
The SD-BC is shown to be operationally equivalent to a class of relay-BCs
(RBCs) and the correspondence between their capacity regions is established.
The capacity region of the SD-BC is transformed into an equivalent region that
is shown to be dual to the admissible region of the WAK problem in the sense
that the information measures defining the corner points of both regions
coincide. Achievability and converse proofs for the equivalent region are
provided. For the converse, we use a probabilistic construction of auxiliary
random variables that depends on the distribution induced by the codebook.
Several examples illustrate the results.

provide stellar and gas kinematics, ionised gas properties and stellar
population diagnostics, over the full optical extent of both galaxies. The Mice
provide a perfect case study highlighting the importance of IFS data for
improving our understanding of local galaxies. The impact of first passage on
the kinematics of the stars and gas has been significant, with strong bars
likely induced in both galaxies. The barred spiral NGC4676B exhibits a strong
twist in both its stellar and ionised gas disk. On the other hand, the impact
of the merger on the stellar populations has been minimal thus far: star
formation induced by the recent close passage has not contributed significantly
to the global star formation rate or stellar mass of the galaxies. Both
galaxies show bicones of high ionisation gas extending along their minor axes.
In NGC4676A the high gas velocity dispersion and Seyfert-like line ratios at
large scaleheight indicate a powerful outflow. Fast shocks extend to ~6.6kpc
above the disk plane. The measured ram pressure and mass outflow rate
(~8-20Msol/yr) are similar to superwinds from local ULIRGs, although NGC4676A
has only a moderate infrared luminosity of 3x10^10Lsol. Energy beyond that
provided by the mechanical energy of the starburst appears to be required to
drive the outflow. We compare the observations to mock kinematic and stellar
population maps from a merger simulation. The models show little enhancement in
star formation during and following first passage, in agreement with the
observations. We highlight areas where IFS data could help further constrain
the models.

the existence of solutions in the Hilbert space $H$ of semilinear equation \[ L

mapping and $h\in H$. In this project we concentrate on the case when $0$
belongs to the essential spectrum of operator $L$ which was not previously
studied in this general setting.
  In chapter 2 we additionally assume that $0$ is the infimum of the essential
spectrum of $L$. We apply the degree theory for densely defined mappings of
class $(S_+)$ to the operator given by the left hand side of the equation. We
assume that non-linear part $N$ is quasi-monotone and satisfies sublinear
growth condition. Moreover, since $0$ can have non-trivial eigenspace, we make
use of the so called recession functional connected with $L$ and $N$ which
allows to control the behaviour of non-linear part on the kernel of $L$.
  In chapter 3 we allow the essential spectrum of $L$ to lay below zero. Our
method is based on the observation that certain perturbation of operator $L$ is
maximal monotone on the subspace of $H$ corresponding to non-negative part of
the spectrum of $L$ and we assume that operator $N$ satisfies certain
monotonicity condition as well. Next we explore the surjectivity properties of
maximal monotone operators to show the existence of solutions to the class of
perturbed equations. Finally with the help of recession functional and a growth
conditions on $N$ we prove the solvability of the equation. The application to
the solvability of stationary semilinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation is given.

particular, the role of feedback and magnetic field are still partially
understood. We investigate the role played by supernovae feedback and magnetic
field onto the star formation and the structure of the Galactic disk. We
perform numerical simulations of the turbulent, magnetized, self-gravitating,
multi-phase, supernovae regulated ISM within a 1 kpc stratified box. We
implemented various schemes for the supernovae. This goes from a random
distribution at a fixed rate to distributions for which the supernovae are
spatially and temporally correlated to the formation of stars. To study the
influence of magnetic field on star formation, we perform both hydrodynamical
and magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. We find that supernovae feedback has a
drastic influence on the galactic evolution. The supernovae distribution is
playing a very significant role. When the supernovae are not correlated with
star formation events, they do not modify significantly the very high star
formation rate obtained without feedback. When the supernovae follow the
accretion, the star formation rate can be reduced by a factor up to 30.
Magnetic field is also playing a significant role. It reduces the star
formation rate by a factor up to 2-3 and reduces the number of collapse sites
by a factor of about 2. The exact correlation between the supernovae and the
dense gas appears to have significant consequences on the galactic disk
evolution and the star formation. This implies that small scale studies are
necessary to understand and quantify the feedback efficiency. Magnetic field
does influence the star formation at galactic scales by reducing the star
formation rate and the number of star formation sites.

become increasingly important for scientific decisions. From submissions and
subscriptions to grants and hirings, researchers, policy makers, and funding
agencies make important decisions with influence from journal rankings such as
the ISI journal impact factor. Typically, the rankings are derived from the
citation network between a selection of journals and unavoidably depend on this
selection. However, little is known about how robust rankings are to the
selection of included journals. Here we compare the robustness of three journal
rankings based on network flows induced on citation networks. They model
pathways of researchers navigating scholarly literature, stepping between
journals and remembering their previous steps to different degree: zero-step
memory as impact factor, one-step memory as Eigenfactor, and two-step memory,
corresponding to zero-, first-, and second-order Markov models of citation flow
between journals. We conclude that higher-order Markov models perform better
and are more robust to the selection of journals. Whereas our analysis
indicates that higher-order models perform better, the performance gain for the
second-order Markov model comes at the cost of requiring more citation data
over a longer time period.

considered. In particular, assuming that two epochs are each other entangled,
by measuring the entanglement degree, it is possible to recover dynamical
properties of the universe. In particular, the effects of dark energy could be
due to the entanglement between states, since a negative pressure arises at
late times. In this process, we choose as ruler to quantify the entanglement
weight, the so called negativity of entanglement. It follows that a natural
anti-gravitational effect occurs when the cosmological eras are entangled.
Thus, dark energy could be seen as a straightforward consequence of
entanglement. Specifically, our results can be compared with observational

protocol which is used to find correct & shortest route to destination. Due to
openness, dynamic, infrastructure-less nature, MANET are vulnerable to various
attacks. One of these possible attacks is a Black Hole Attack in which a mobile
node falsely replies to the source node that it is having a shortest path to

all of its data to the black hole node and it deprives all the traffic of the

set of operations that transforms a given graph to have a certain property. The
most commonly considered operations include vertex deletion, edge deletion, and
edge addition; for the same property, one can define significantly different
versions by allowing different operations. We study a very general graph
modification problem which allows all three types of operations: given a graph
$G$ and integers $k_1$, $k_2$, and $k_3$, the \textsc{chordal editing} problem
asks whether $G$ can be transformed into a chordal graph by at most $k_1$
vertex deletions, $k_2$ edge deletions, and $k_3$ edge additions. Clearly, this
problem generalizes both \textsc{chordal vertex/edge deletion} and
\textsc{chordal completion} (also known as \textsc{minimum fill-in}). Our main
result is an algorithm for \textsc{chordal editing} in time $2^{O(k\log

measurements if they are neglected. One such effect gives a systematic shift in
the distance-redshift relation away from its background value, due to the non-
linear relativistic conservation of total photon flux. We also show directly
how this shift follows from a fully relativistic analysis of the geodesic
deviation equation. We derive the expectation value of the shift using
second-order perturbations about a concordance background, and show that the
distance to last scattering is increased by 1%. We argue that neglecting this
shift could lead to a significant bias in the background cosmological
parameters, because it alters the meaning of the background model. A naive
adjustment of CMB parameter estimation if this shift is really a correction to
the background would raise the H0 value inferred from the CMB by 5%,
potentially removing the tension with local measurements of H0. Other CMB
parameters which depend on the distance would also be shifted by ~1sigma when
combined with local H0 data. While our estimations rely on a simplistic
analysis, they nevertheless illustrate that accurately defining the background
model in terms of the expectation values of observables is critical when we aim
to determine the model parameters at the sub-percent level.

unpromising: it is likely to produce a poor match or require excessive time.
This paper proposes lazy ABC, an ABC importance sampling algorithm which saves
time by sometimes abandoning such simulations. This makes ABC more scalable to
applications where simulation is expensive. By using a random stopping rule and
appropriate reweighting step, the target distribution is unchanged from that of
standard ABC. Theory and practical methods to tune lazy ABC are presented and

the pair production of gluinos, each decaying to a top squark and a top quark,
with the top squark decaying to a charm quark and a neutralino. These limits
extend the region of supersymmetric parameter space excluded by previous

estimated from new and archival X-ray observations of CLASH clusters. We
compare measurements derived from XMM and Chandra observations with one another
and compare both to gravitational lensing mass profiles derived with CLASH HST
and ground-based lensing data. Radial profiles of Chandra and XMM electron
density and enclosed gas mass are nearly identical, indicating that differences
in hydrostatic masses inferred from X-ray observations arise from differences
in Tx measurements. Encouragingly, cluster Txs are consistent with one another
at ~100-200 kpc radii but XMM Tx systematically decline relative to Chandra Tx
at larger radii. The angular dependence of the discrepancy suggests additional
investigation on systematics such as the XMM point spread function correction,
vignetting and off-axis responses. We present the CLASH-X mass-profile
comparisons in the form of cosmology-independent and redshift-independent
circular-velocity profiles. Ratios of Chandra HSE mass profiles to CLASH
lensing profiles show no obvious radial dependence in the 0.3-0.8 Mpc range.
However, the mean mass biases inferred from the WL and SaWLens data are
different. e.g., the weighted-mean value at 0.5 Mpc is <b> = 0.12 for the WL
comparison and <b> = -0.11 for the SaWLens comparison. The ratios of XMM HSE
mass profiles to CLASH lensing profiles show a pronounced radial dependence in
the 0.3-1.0 Mpc range, with a weighted mean mass bias of value rising to
<b>~0.3 at ~1 Mpc for the WL comparison and <b> of 0.25 for SaWLens comparison.
The enclosed gas mass profiles from both Chandra and XMM rise to a value 1/8
times the total-mass profiles inferred from lensing at 0.5 Mpc and remain
constant outside of that radius, suggesting that [8xMgas] profiles may be an
excellent proxy for total-mass profiles at >0.5 Mpc in massive galaxy clusters.

in the coupling parameters. The emerging topology is characterized by a
delicate interplay of excitatory and inhibitory links leading to the
stabilization of the desired cluster state. As a crucial parameter determining
this interplay we identify the delay time. Furthermore, we show how to
construct networks such that they exhibit not only a given cluster state but
also with a given oscillation frequency. We apply our method to coupled
Stuart-Landau oscillators, a paradigmatic normal form that naturally arises in
an expansion of systems close to a Hopf bifurcation. The successful and robust

con- firmed with radial velocity follow-up observations from Keck-HIRES. The

insufficient to constrain models of its internal structure and composition in

HARPS-N Collaboration decided to observe Kepler-10 intensively with the HARPS-N

properties of a space $X$. (1) $X$ is Polish. (2) For every countable crowded
$Q\subseteq X$ there exists a crowded $Q'\subseteq Q$ with compact closure. (3)
Every closed subspace of $X$ is either scattered or it contains a homeomorphic
copy of $2^\omega$. (4) Every closed subspace of $X$ is a Baire space. While
(4) is the well-known property of being completely Baire, properties (2) and
(3) have been recently introduced by Kunen, Medini and Zdomskyy, who named them
the Miller property and the Cantor-Bendixson property respectively. It turns
out that the implications $(1)\rightarrow (2)\rightarrow (3)\rightarrow (4)$
hold for every space $X$. Furthermore, it follows from a classical result of
Hurewicz that all these implications are equivalences if $X$ is coanalytic.
Under the axiom of Projective Determinacy, this equivalence result extends to
all projective spaces. We will complete the picture by giving a $\mathsf{ZFC}$
counterexample and a consistent definable counterexample of lowest possible
complexity to the implication $(i)\leftarrow (i+1)$ for $i=1,2,3$. For one of
these counterexamples we will need a classical theorem of Martin and Solovay,
of which we give a new proof, based on a result of Baldwin and Beaudoin.
Finally, using a method of Fischer and Friedman, we will investigate how
changing the value of the continuum affects the definability of these
counterexamples. Along the way, we will show that every uncountable completely
Baire space has size continuum.

characteristics of a steady three dimensional Sisko fluid. The flow is induced
due to bidirectional stretching sheet. The influence of power-law index and
stretching ratio on flow and heat transfer is studied thoroughly. Governing
partial differential equations are reduced to coupled ordinary differential
equations by suitable similarity variable. The resulting equations are then
solved numerically by shooting method using adaptive Runge Kutta algorithm in
combination with Broyden's method in the domain . The numerical results for the
velocity and temperature fields are graphically presented and effects of the
relevant parameters are discussed in detail. Moreover, the skin-friction
coefficient and local Nusselt number for different values of the power-law
index and stretching ratio are presented through tabulated data. The numerical
results are verified with the results obtained by HAM. Additionally, the
results are also validated with previously published pertinent literature as a
special case of the problem.

  An SNR based approach",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of secure communication in Amplify-and-Forward (AF) relay
networks with multiple eavesdroppers is considered. Assuming that a receiver
(destination or eavesdropper) can decode a message only if the received SNR is
above a predefined threshold, we introduce SNR based optimization formulations
to calculate optimal scaling factors for relay nodes in two scenarios. In the
first scenario, we maximize the achievable rate at the legitimate destination,
subject to the condition that the received SNR at each eavesdropper is below
the target threshold. Due to the non-convex nature of the objective function
and eavesdroppers' constraints, we transform variables and obtain a
Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP) with convex constraints,
which can be solved efficiently. When the constraints are not convex, we
consider a Semi-definite relaxation (SDR). In the second scenario, we minimize
the total power consumed by all relay nodes, subject to the condition that the
received SNR at the legitimate destination is above the threshold and at every
eavesdropper, it is below the corresponding threshold. We propose a
semi-definite relaxation of the problem in this scenario and also provide an
analytical lower bound.
