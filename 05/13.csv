nucleon. The model in which the multiparticle production is driven by the
dissipating effective energy of participants is introduced. The model is based
on the earlier proposed approach, combining the constituent quark picture
together with Landau relativistic hydrodynamics shown to interrelate the
measurements from different types of collisions. Within this model, the
dependence on the number of participants in heavy-ion collisions are found to
be well described in terms of the effective energy defined as a
centrality-dependent fraction of the collision energy. For both variables under

dependence obtained for the most central collisions and centrality data in the
entire available energy range. Predictions are made for the investigated
dependencies for the forthcoming higher energy measurements in heavy-ion

from which the quantum kinetic equation due to Kadanoff and Baym (KB) is
derived, often called the Quantum Boltzmann Equation (QBE); (b) The equation
obeyed by this has a collision contribution in the form of a two-particle Green

classical Boltzmann kinetic equation, the contribution from the kinetic entropy
term was non-positive; (3) Kadanoff surmised that this situation could perhaps
be related to quantum entanglement that may not have been included in his
theory. It is shown that GWD is not positive everywhere (indicating dynamical
quantumness) just like the commonly recognized property of the Wigner function
(negative property indicating quantumness of the state). The issue of
non-positive feature appearing in approximate evaluation of patently positive
entities in many particle systems is here pointed to an early discussion of
this issue (Phys. Rev. A10, 1852 (1974)) in terms of a theorem on truncation of
cumulant expansion of a probability distribution function due to Marcinkeiwicz.
The last issue of presence or absence of entanglement in an approximate
evaluation of a many particle correlation poses a new problem; it is considered
here in terms of fermionic entanglement theory in the light of density matrix
and Green function theory of many-fermion systems. The clue comes from the fact
that the Hartree-Fock approximation exhbits no entantanglement in two-particle
fermion density matrix and hence also in two-particle Green function.

second level, the followers (the fare-evading passengers) respond by optimizing

followers' behavior we study both a non-adaptive variant, in which passengers
select a path a priori and continue along it throughout their journey, and an
adaptive variant, in which they gain information along the way and use it to
update their route. For these problems, which are interesting in their own
right, we design exact and approximation algorithms and we prove a tight bound
of 3/4 on the ratio of the optimal cost between adaptive and non-adaptive

flexible-fare variant, where ticket prices may or may not be set at the

motivates us to study the energy efficiency via the lens of average latency.
Through this connection, we show that erasure coding serves the dual purpose of
reducing latency and increasing energy efficiency. We present a queuing

of such devices are quantified by the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of
merit (ZT), which is proportional to the ratio of a device's electrical
conductance to its thermal conductance. High ZT (>2) has been achieved in
materials via all-scale hierarchical architecturing. This efficiency holds at
high temperatures (700K~900K) but quickly diminishes at lower temperatures. In
this paper, a recently-fabricated two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor called
phosphorene (monolayer black phosphorus) is assessed for its thermoelectric
capabilities. First-principles and model calculations reveal that phosphorene
possesses spatially-anisotropic electrical and thermal conductances. The
prominent electrical and thermal conducting directions are orthogonal to one
another, enhancing the ratio of these conductances. As a result, ZT can reach
2.5 (the criterion for commercial deployment) along the armchair direction of
phosphorene at T=500K and is greater than 1 even at room temperature given
moderate doping (~2 x 10^16 m-2). Ultimately, phosphorene stands out as an
environmentally sound thermoelectric material with unprecedented qualities:
intrinsically, it is a mechanically flexible material that converts heat energy

of the solar photosphere. Their formation is usually attributed to the
concentration of magnetic field to kG strengths by the convective collapse

has prevented this scenario from being studied in fully resolved structures.
Here we report on the formation and subsequent evolution of one such
photospheric magnetic flux tube, observed in the quiet Sun with unprecedented
spatial resolution (0\farcs 15 - 0\farcs 18) and high temporal cadence (33 s).
The observations were acquired by the Imaging Magnetograph Experiment (IMaX)
aboard the \textsc{Sunrise} balloon-borne solar observatory. The equipartition
field strength magnetic element is the result of the merging of several same
polarity magnetic flux patches, including a footpoint of a previously emerged
loop. The magnetic structure is then further intensified to kG field strengths
by convective collapse. The fine structure found within the flux concentration
reveals that the scenario is more complex than can be described by a thin flux
tube model with bright points and downflow plumes being established near the
edges of the kG magnetic feature. We also observe a daisy-like alignment of
surrounding granules and a long-lived inflow towards the magnetic feature.
After a subsequent weakening process, the field is again intensified to kG
strengths. The area of the magnetic feature is seen to change in anti-phase
with the field strength, while the brightness of the bright points and the
speed of the downflows varies in phase. We also find a relation between the

theory of active and non-active infinitesimals and intended to establish
quantifier elimination in quasianalytic structures. That article, however, did
not attain full generality, which refers to one of its results, namely the
theorem on an active infinitesimal, playing an essential role in our
non-standard analysis. The general case was covered in our subsequent preprint,
which constitutes a basis for the approach presented here. We also provide a
quasianalytic exposition of the results concerning rectilinearization of terms
and of definable functions from our earlier research. It will be used to
demonstrate a quasianalytic structure corresponding to a Denjoy-Carleman class
which, unlike the classical analytic structure, does not admit quantifier
elimination in the language of restricted quasianalytic functions augmented
merely by the reciprocal function. More precisely, we construct a plane
definable curve, which indicates both that the classical theorem by J. Denef
and L. van den Dries as well as \L{}ojasiewicz's theorem that every subanalytic
curve is semianalytic are no longer true for quasianalytic structures. Besides
rectilinearization of terms, our construction makes use of some theorems on
power substitution for Denjoy-Carleman classes and on non-extendability of
quasianalytic function germs. The last result relies on Grothendieck's
factorization and open mapping theorems for (LF)-spaces. Note finally that this
paper comprises our earlier preprints on the subject from May 2012.

extensional database and an ontology (i.e., a set of logical assertions and
constraints which derive new intensional knowledge from the extensional
database), rather than directly on the extensional database. The evaluation and
optimization of such queries is an intriguing new problem for database
research. In this paper, we discuss two important aspects of this problem:
query rewriting and query optimization. Query rewriting consists of the
compilation of an ontological query into an equivalent first-order query
against the underlying extensional database. We present a novel query rewriting
algorithm for rather general types of ontological constraints which is
well-suited for practical implementations. In particular, we show how a
conjunctive query against a knowledge base, expressed using linear and sticky
existential rules, that is, members of the recently introduced Datalog+/-
family of ontology languages, can be compiled into a union of conjunctive
queries (UCQ) against the underlying database. Ontological query optimization,
in this context, attempts to improve this rewriting process so to produce
possibly small and cost-effective UCQ rewritings for an input query.

considered in many studies dealing with prospective power systems is the
installation of storage devices to balance the fluctuations in power
production. However, it is not yet clear how soon storage devices will be
needed and how the integration process depends on different storage parameters.
Using long-term solar and wind energy power production data series, we present
a modelling approach to investigate the influence of storage size and
efficiency on the pathway towards a 100% RES scenario. Applying our approach to
data for Germany, we found that up to 50% of the overall electricity demand can
be met by an optimum combination of wind and solar resources without both
curtailment and storage devices if the remaining energy is provided by
sufficiently flexible power plants. Our findings show further that the
installation of small, but highly efficient storage devices is already highly
beneficial for the RES integration, while seasonal storage devices are only
needed when more than 80% of the electricity demand can be met by wind and
solar energy. Our results imply that a compromise between the installation of
additional generation capacities and storage capacities is required.

the optical absorption spectra of fullerene (C$_{60}$) near coinage metal

$\omega_S$ influences the optical activity of fullerene. We find the lower
energy fullerene excitons at 3.77 and 4.8 eV only weakly interact with the
surface plasmon. However, we find the surface plasmon strongly interacts with
the most intense fullerene $\pi$ exciton, i.e.\ the dipolar mode at
$\hbar\omega_+\approx$ 6.5 eV, and the quadrupolar mode at
$\hbar\omega_-\approx$ 6.8 eV. When fullerene is close to a copper surface
($z_0\approx$ 5.3 \AA) the dipolar mode $\omega_+$ and ""localized"" surface
plasmons in the molecule/surface interface hybridize to form two coupled modes
which both absorb light. As a result, the molecule gains an additional
optically active mode. Moreover, in resonance, when
$\omega_S\approx\omega_\pm$, the strong interaction with the surface plasmon
destroys the $\omega_-$ quadrupolar character and it becomes an optically
active mode. In this case the molecule gains two additional very intense
optically active modes. Further, we find this resonance condition, $\omega_S
\approx \omega_\pm$, is satisfied by silver and gold metal surfaces.

content distribution. Named-Data Networking (NDN) is an instantiation of CCN, a

secure, and scalable content distribution. Because of NDN's fundamental
requirement that each content object must be signed by its producer,
fragmentation has been considered incompatible with NDN since it precludes
authentication of individual content fragments by routers. The alternative is
to perform hop-by-hop reassembly, which incurs prohibitive delays. In this
paper, we show that secure and efficient content fragmentation is both possible
and even advantageous in NDN and similar content-centric network architectures
that involve signed content. We design a concrete technique that facilitates
efficient and secure content fragmentation in NDN, discuss its security
guarantees and assess performance. We also describe a prototype implementation
and compare performance of cut-through with hop-by-hop fragmentation and
reassembly.

crystals has a very broad photonic band gap and consists of two perpendicular
arrays of pores with a rectangular structure. The point defect that acts as a
cavity is centred on the intersection of two intersecting perpendicular pores
with a radius that differs from the ones in the bulk of the crystal. We have
performed supercell bandstructure calculations with up to $5 \times 5 \times 5$
unit cells. We find that up to five isolated and dispersionless bands appear
within the 3D photonic band gap. For each isolated band, the electric-field
energy is localized in a volume centred on the point defect, hence the point
defect acts as a 3D photonic band gap cavity. The mode volume of the cavities
resonances is as small as 0.8 $\lambda^{3}$ (resonance wavelength cubed),
indicating a strong confinement of the light. By varying the radius of the

radius, whereas no acceptor-like resonances appear for greater defect radius.
From a 3D plot of the distribution of the electric-field energy density we
conclude that peaks of energy found in sharp edges situated at the point
defect, similar to how electrons collect at such features. This is different

It has opened a new paradigm for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians ranging from

is responsible for power dissipation, therefore typically degrading device
performance such as attenuation of a laser beam. By carefully exploiting
optical loss in the complex dielectric permittivity, however, recent
exploration of PT symmetry revolutionizes our understandings in fundamental
physics and intriguing optical phenomena such as exceptional points and phase
transition that are critical for high-speed optical modulators. The interplay
between optical gain and loss in photonic PT synthetic matters offers a new
criterion of positively utilizing loss to efficiently manipulate gain and its
associated optical properties. Instead of simply compensating optical loss in
conventional lasers, for example, it is theoretically proposed that judiciously
designed delicate modulation of optical loss and gain can lead to PT synthetic
lasing that fundamentally broadens laser physics. Here, we report the first
experimental demonstration of PT synthetic lasers. By carefully exploiting the
interplay between gain and loss, we achieve degenerate eigen modes at the same
frequency but with complex conjugate gain and loss coefficients. In contrast to
conventional ring cavity lasers with multiple modes, the PT synthetic
micro-ring laser exhibits an intrinsic single mode lasing: the non-threshold PT
broken phase inherently associated in such a photonic system squeezes broadband
optical gain into a single lasing mode regardless of the gain spectral
bandwidth. This chip-scale semiconductor platform provides a unique route
towards fundamental explorations of PT physics and next generation of
optoelectronic devices for optical communications and computing.

policy finds the non-avoidable failures that occur due to physical
disconnection. In the second phase, our algorithm redistributes the power so
that all the connected communication nodes have enough power for operation and
no power lines overload. We perform a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the

minimalistic model of an alkanethiol on gold as a model system and demonstrate
that, even with limited control over the interaction between surface

classical trajectories, we identify signatures of over-the-barrier and tunnel

sets of phase-space trajectories in order to model such features. Overall, we
find good agreement with the full solution of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger

partly reproduce features associated with the wave packet crossing classically
forbidden regions, although the trajectories employed in its construction
always obey classical phase-space constraints. We also show that the Coupled

Furthermore, we sow that both the HK propagator and the CCS approach may be
successfully employed to compute the time-dependent dipole acceleration and
high-harmonic spectra. Nevertheless, the semiclassical propagator exhibits a
worse agreement with the TDSE than the outcome of the CCS method, as it neither

to a dephasing in the time-dependent wave function which becomes more
pronounced for longer times.

  We treat this problem as a multi-armed bandit problem, with each ""arm""

infinite) number of arms, we propose a new algorithm, AgnosticZooming, which
discretizes the contract space into a finite number of regions, effectively
treating each region as a single arm. This discretization is adaptively
refined, so that more promising regions of the contract space are eventually
discretized more finely. We analyze this algorithm, showing that it achieves
regret sublinear in the time horizon and substantially improves over
non-adaptive discretization (which is the only competing approach in the

Multicell cooperation techniques, such as coordinated multipoint (CoMP)
transmission, have been proposed as a promising solution to mitigate the impact
of the cross-tier interference in multi-tier networks. In this paper, we
propose a novel scheme for Location-Aware Cross-Tier Cooperation (LA-CTC)
between BSs in different tiers for downlink CoMP transmission in two-tier
cellular networks. On one hand, the proposed scheme only uses CoMP transmission
to enhance the performance of the users who suffer from high cross-tier
interference due to the co-channel deployment of small cells such as picocells.
On the other hand, users with good signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(${\rm SINR}$) conditions are served directly by a single BS from any of the
two tiers. Thus, the data exchange between the cooperating BSs over the
backhaul network can be reduced when compared to the traditional CoMP
transmission scheme. We use tools from stochastic geometry to quantify the
performance gains obtained by using the proposed scheme in terms of outage
probability, achievable data rate, and load per BS. We compare the performance
of the proposed scheme with that of other schemes in the literature such as the
schemes which use cooperation to serve all users and schemes that use range

practical performance, little is known about the mathematical properties of the

forests can nicely adapt to sparsity. 1. Introduction. Random forests are an
ensemble learning method for classification and regression that constructs a
number of randomized decision trees during the training phase and predicts by
averaging the results. Since its publication in the seminal paper of Breiman
(2001), the procedure has become a major data analysis tool, that performs well
in practice in comparison with many standard methods. What has greatly
contributed to the popularity of forests is the fact that they can be applied
to a wide range of prediction problems and have few parameters to tune. Aside
from being simple to use, the method is generally recognized for its accuracy
and its ability to deal with small sample sizes, high-dimensional feature
spaces and complex data structures. The random forest methodology has been
successfully involved in many practical problems, including air quality
prediction (winning code of the EMC data science global hackathon in 2012, see

plan under execution to make it amenable to the new conditions, and to resume

three different metrics -- have been proposed in prior automated planning work.
An open question is whether these metrics are interchangeable; answering this
requires a normalized comparison of the various replanning quality metrics. In
this paper, we show that it is possible to support such a comparison by
compiling all the respective techniques into a single substrate. Using this
novel compilation, we demonstrate that these different metrics are not
interchangeable, and that they are not good surrogates for each other. Thus we
focus attention on the incompatibility of the various replanning flavors with
each other, founded in the differences between the metrics that they

comparable structures and similar melting temperatures, a blend can be
evaporated, giving rise to thin films of identical and reproducible composition
compared to those of the pre-mixture. The principle of fine color tuning is
demonstrated by evaporating a 1-nm-thick layer of this blend within the
hole-transport layer (4,4'-bis[N-(1-naphtyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl
(\alpha-NPB)) of a standard fluorescent OLED structure. Upon playing on the
position of the UPL inside the hole-transport layer, as well as on the premix
composition, two independent parameters are available to finely control the
emitted color. Combined with blue emission from the heterojunction, white light

The spectrum reveals that the fcho material does not emit light due to
efficient energy transfer to the red-emitting fvin compound but plays the role
of a host matrix for fvin, allowing for a very precise adjustment of the red
dopant amount in the device.

collected a number of high-resolution spectra in order to calculate radial

with the photometry from the ASAS and SuperWASP archives. We also performed an
atmospheric analysis of the component spectra with the Spectroscopy Made Easy

dwarfs having masses of $M_1=0.6958 \pm 0.0010$ and $M_2=0.6355 \pm 0.0007$

  AK For is the brightest system among the known eclipsing binaries with K or M

among the binaries with the best mass measurements in the literature. It also
fills the gap in our knowledge of stars in the range of 0.5-0.8 M$_\odot$, and
between short and long-period systems. All this makes AK For a unique benchmark

transition between the regime dominated by free monomers and that with a
self-sustaining population of sufficiently long chains. We provide a simple,
mathematically tractable model supported by numerical simulations, which
predicts the distribution of chain lengths and the onset of autocatalysis in
terms of the overall monomer concentration and two fundamental rate constants.
Another key result of our study is the emergence of the kinetically-limited
optimal overlap length between a template and each of its two substrates. The
template-assisted ligation allows for heritable transmission of the information
encoded in chain sequences thus opening up the possibility of long-term memory

enough freedom to simultaneously admit a matching of the concordance model
background expansion history. In particular, there exists a large model space
that mimics the concordance model on all linear quasistatic subhorizon scales

the theory space to operators introduced in Horndeski scalar-tensor gravity. We
emphasize that whereas the partially shielded scenarios might be of interest to
study in connection with tensions between large and small scale data, with
conventional cosmological probes, the ability to distinguish the fully shielded
scenarios from the concordance model on near-horizon scales will remain limited
by cosmic variance. Novel tests of the large-scale structure remedying this
deficiency and accounting for the full covariant nature of the alternative
gravitational theories, however, might yield further insights on gravity in

spectrum with photon index $\Gamma$$\sim$4, as observed by Swift and Chandra,
until $\approx 10^7$ s, when XMM-Newton observations uncover a harder spectral
shape with $\Gamma$$\sim$2.5, commonly observed in GRB afterglows. We find that
two distinct emission components are needed to explain the X-ray observations:
a thermal component, which dominates the X-ray emission for several weeks, and
a non-thermal component, consistent with a typical afterglow. A forward shock
model well describes the broadband (from radio to X-rays) afterglow spectrum at
various epochs. It requires an ambient medium with a very low density wind
profile, consistent with that expected from a low-metallicity blue supergiant
(BSG). The thermal component has a remarkably constant size and a total energy
consistent with those expected by a hot cocoon surrounding the relativistic
jet. We argue that the features observed in this GRB (its ultralong duration,
the thermal cocoon, and the low density wind environment) are associated with a
low metallicity BSG progenitor and, thus, should characterize the class of
ultralong GRBs.

the evolving companion. Therefore, the final stage consists of a binary made of
a MSP and the core of the deeply peeled companion. In the last years, however
an increasing number of systems deviating from these expectations has been
discovered, thus strongly indicating that our understanding of MSPs is far to
be complete. The identification of the optical companions to binary MSPs is
crucial to constrain the formation and evolution of these objects. In dense
environments such as Globular Clusters (GCs), it also allows us to get insights
on the cluster internal dynamics. By using deep photometric data, acquired both
from space and ground-based telescopes, we identified 5 new companions to MSPs.
Three of them being located in GCs and two in the Galactic Field. The three new
identifications in GCs increased by 50% the number of such objects known before
this Thesis. They all are non-degenerate stars, at odds with the expectations
of the ""canonical recycling scenario"". These results therefore suggest either
that transitory phases should also be taken into account, or that dynamical
processes, as exchange interactions, play a crucial role in the evolution of
MSPs. We also performed a spectroscopic follow-up of the companion to PSR
J1740-5340A in the GC NGC 6397, confirming that it is a deeply peeled star
descending from a ~0.8$M_{\odot}$ progenitor. This nicely confirms the
theoretical expectations about the formation and evolution of MSPs.

selected clusters binned by estimated optical richness. Using mock catalogues
created from N-body simulations populated realistically with galaxies, we ran a
suite of optical cluster finders and estimated their optical richness. We
binned galaxy clusters by true cluster mass and estimated optical richness and
measure the ellipticity of these stacks. We find that the processes of optical

weak-lensing alone cannot measure the size of this orientation bias. Weak
lensing masses of stacked optically selected clusters are overestimated by up
to 3-6 per cent when clusters can be uniquely associated with haloes. This
effect is large enough to lead to significant biases in the cosmological
parameters derived from large surveys like the Dark Energy Survey, if not

with dilatonic interactions. Such couplings can arise for the dilaton as well
as for moduli and axion-like particles in the presence of CP violation.
Ultralight dilaton DM acts as a background field that can cause tiny but
coherent oscillations in Standard Model parameters such as the fine structure
constant and the proton-electron mass ratio. These minute variations can be
detected through precise frequency comparisons of atomic clocks. Our experiment
extends current searches for drifts in fundamental constants to the
well-motivated high-frequency regime. Our proposed setups can probe scalars
lighter than 10^-15 eV with discovery potential of dilatonic couplings as weak
as 10^-11 times the strength of gravity, improving current equivalence
principle bounds by up to 8 orders of magnitude. We point out potential 10^4
sensitivity enhancements with future optical and nuclear clocks, as well as
possible signatures in gravitational wave detectors. Finally, we discuss
cosmological constraints and astrophysical hints of ultralight scalar DM, and
show they are complimentary to and compatible with the parameter range

gauge coupling unification, such as the (non-supersymmetric) Standard Model.
More specifically, if the superparters have masses well above the TeV scale,
the resulting imperfection in unification can be accounted for by the, in
principle calculable, classical F-theory correction at the high scale. In this
paper we argue for the correct form of the F-theory corrections to unification,
including KK mode loop effects. However, the price of compensating the
imprecise unification in such High Scale SUSY models with F-theory corrections
is that the GUT scale is lowered, potentially leading to a dangerously high
proton decay rate from dimension-6 operators. We analyse the possibility of
suppressing the decay rate by the localization of $X,Y$ gauge bosons in higher
dimensions. While this effect can be very strong for the zero modes, we find
that in the simplest models of this type it is difficult to realize a
significant suppression for higher modes (Landau levels). Notably, in the
absence of substantial suppressions to the proton decay rate, the superpartners
must be lighter than 100 TeV to satisfy proton decay constraints. We highlight
that multiple correlated signals of proton decay could verify this scenario.

covering a decade and spanning the far UV to the near-infrared spectral regions
can identify the radiation sources, the atmospheric structure produced by
accretion,and properties of the stellar wind. On time scales from days to
years, substantial changes occur in emission line profiles and line strengths.
Our extensive time-domain spectroscopy suggests that the broad near-IR,
optical, and far-uv emission lines, centered on the star, originate in a
turbulent post-shock region and can undergo scattering by the overlying stellar
wind as well as some absorption from infalling material. Stable absorption
features appear in H-alpha, apparently caused by an accreting column
silhouetted in the stellar wind. Inflow of material onto the star is revealed
by the near-IR He I 10830A line, and its free-fall velocity correlates
inversely with the strength of the post-shock emission, consistent with a
dipole accretion model. However, the predictions of hydrogen line profiles
based on accretion stream models are not well-matched by these observations.
Evidence of an accelerating warm to hot stellar wind is shown by the near-IR He
I line, and emission profiles of C II, C III, C IV, N V, and O VI. The outflow
of material changes substantially in both speed and opacity in the yearly
sampling of the near-IR He I line over a decade. Terminal outflow velocities
that range from 200 km/s to almost 400 km/s in He I appear to be directly
related to the amount of post- shock emission, giving evidence for an
accretion-driven stellar wind. Calculations of the emission from realistic
post- shock regions are needed.

reconnection event remains poorly known: what is the amount given to kinetic
energy, the ion/electron repartition, and the hardness of the particle
distributions? We explore these questions with 2D particle-in-cell simulations
of ion-electron plasmas. We find that 45 to 75% of the total initial magnetic
energy ends up in kinetic energy, this fraction increasing with the inflow
magnetization. Depending on the guide field strength, ions get from 30 to 60%
of the total kinetic energy. Particles can be separated into two populations
that only weakly mix: (i) particles initially in the current sheet, heated by
its initial tearing and subsequent contraction of the islands; and (ii)
particles from the background plasma that primarily gain energy via the
reconnection electric field when passing near the X-point. Particles (ii) tend
to form a power-law with an index $p=-d\log n(\gamma)/d\log\gamma$, that
depends mostly on the inflow Alfv\'en speed $V_A$ and magnetization $\sigma_s$
of species $s$, with for electrons $p=5$ to $1.2$ for increasing $\sigma_e$.
The highest particle Lorentz factor, for ions or electrons, increases roughly
linearly with time for all the relativistic simulations. This is faster, and
the spectra can be harder, than for collisionless shock acceleration. We
discuss applications to microquasar and AGN coronae, to extragalactic jets, and

hereditary categories and introduced the notion of regularity preserving

conditions on the Ext-nontrivial couples (exceptional objects $X,Y\in \mathcal
A$ with ${\rm Ext}^1(X,Y)\neq 0$ and ${\rm Ext}^1(Y,X)\neq 0$) were shown to
imply regularity-preserving. This paper is a brief review of the previous paper
(with emphasis on regularity preserving property) and we add some remarks and
conjectures.
  It is known that in Dynkin quivers ${\rm Hom}(\rho,\rho')=0$ or ${\rm
Ext}^1(\rho,\rho')=0$ for any two exceptional representations. In the present
paper we use this property to show that for any Dynkin quiver $Q$ there are no
Ext-nontrivial couples in $Rep_k(Q)$, which implies regularity preserving of
$Rep_k(Q)$, where $k$ is an algebraically closed field. We study this property
in other quivers. In particular in any star quiver with three arms $Q$ for any
two exceptional representations $\rho, \rho'$ we have ${\rm Hom}(\rho,\rho')=0$
or ${\rm Ext}^1(\rho,\rho')=0$ provided that $\rho$ or $\rho'$ is a thin
representation. In the previous version we asserted falsely that this holds for
any two exceptional representations (without imposing the restriction that one
of them is thin) for extended Dynkin quivers $\widetilde{\mathbb E}_6,
\widetilde{\mathbb E}_7, \widetilde{\mathbb E}_8 $.

(AR)10978, which crossed the Sun's disc in the interval 8 to 16 December, 2007
during Carrington rotation (CR)2064. In previous work, using data from the
Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer, upflow velocity evolution was extensively
studied as the region crossed the disc while a linear force-free magnetic
extrapolation was used to confirm aspects of the velocity evolution and to
establish the presence of quasi-separatrix layers at the upflow source areas.
The plasma properties, temperature, density and first ionisation potential bias
(FIP-bias) were measured with the spectrometer during the disc passage of the
active region. Global potential field source surface (PFSS) models showed that
AR 10978 was completely covered by the closed field of a helmet streamer that
is part of the streamer belt. Thus it is not clear how any of the upflowing
AR-associated plasma could reach the source surface at 2.5 R(Sun)and contribute
to the slow solar wind. However a detailed examination of solar-wind in-situ
data obtained by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft at the L1
point shows that the increase in O^7+/O^6+, C^6+/C^5+ and Fe/O - a FIP-bias
proxy - are present before the heliospheric current sheet crossing. These
increases, along with an accompanying reduction in proton velocity and an
increase in density are characteristic of both AR and slow-wind plasma. Finally
we describe a two-step reconnection process by which some of the upflowing

Formally, a neuron minimizes a cost function comprising a cumulative squared

that minimizes such cost function by alternating between the minimization with
respect to activity and with respect to synaptic weights. The steps of this
algorithm reproduce well-known physiological properties of a neuron, such as
weighted summation and leaky integration of synaptic inputs, as well as an
Oja-like, but parameter-free, synaptic learning rule. Our theoretical framework

the light-membrane coupling above which there is a symmetry breaking
bifurcation where the membrane spontaneously acquires a displacement either to
the left or the right. This bifurcation bears many of the signatures of a
second order phase transition and we compare and contrast it with that found in
the Dicke model. In particular, by studying limiting cases and deriving
dynamical critical exponents using the fidelity susceptibility method, we argue
that the two models share very similar critical behaviour. For example, the
obtained critical exponents indicate that they fall within the same
universality class. Away from the critical regime we identify, however, some
discrepancies between the two models. Our results are discussed in terms of
experimentally relevant parameters and we evaluate the prospects for realizing
Dicke-type physics in these systems.

evolutionary relationships may more accurately be described by a reticulated
network than by a tree. In such a network, there will often be several paths
between any two extant species, reflecting the possible pathways that genetic
material may have been passed down from a common ancestor to these species.
These paths will typically have different lengths but an `average distance' can
still be calculated between any two taxa. In this article, we ask whether this
average distance is able to distinguish reticulate evolution from pure
tree-like evolution. We consider two types of reticulation networks:
hybridization networks and HGT networks. For the former, we establish a general
result which shows that average distances between extant taxa can appear
tree-like, but only under a single hybridization event near the root; in all
other cases, the two forms of evolution can be distinguished by average
distances. For HGT networks, we demonstrate some analogous but more intricate
results.

low-energy layer of chirally polarized modes which, in addition to its width
($\Lambda_{ch}$), is also characterized by volume density of participating
modes ($\Omega$) and the volume density of total chirality ($\Omega_{ch}$). Few
possible forms of the correspondence are discussed, paying particular attention
to singular cases where $\Omega$ emerges as the most versatile characteristic.
The notion of finite-volume ""order parameter"", capturing the nature of these
connections, is proposed. We study the effects of temperature (in N$_f$=0 QCD)
and light quarks (in N$_f$=12), both in the regime of possible symmetry
restoration, and find agreement with these ideas. In N$_f$=0 QCD, results from
several volumes indicate that, at the lattice cutoff studied, the deconfinement
temperature $T_c$ is strictly smaller than the overlap-valence chiral
transition temperature $T_{ch}$ in real Polyakov line vacuum. Somewhat similar
intermediate phase (in quark mass) is also seen in N$_f$=12. It is suggested
that deconfinement in N$_f$=0 is related to indefinite convexity of absolute

in momentum space is inversely proportional to the localization length,

formulated as an optimization problem that maximizes a predefined system
utility, e.g., the weighted sum rate or the weighted max-min-fairness (MMF)
rate, subject to constraints on the individual probability of rate outage and
power budget. While the problem is non-convex and appears difficult to handle
due to the intricate outage probability constraints, so far it is still unknown
if this outage constrained problem is computationally tractable. To answer
this, we conduct computational complexity analysis of the outage constrained
CoBF problem. Specifically, we show that the outage constrained CoBF problem

a flat circular velocity of ~60 km/s, is required to have a level of
gravitational stability similar to that found in other galaxies. Adopting this
inclination angle, we find that Ho II lies on the right location in the
baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. Moreover, for this inclination, its rotation
curve is consistent with MOND. However, the corresponding analysis of the
stability under MOND indicates that this galaxy could be problematic for MOND
because its outer parts are marginally unstable in this gravity theory. We urge
MOND simulators to study numerically the non-linear stability of gas-rich dwarf
galaxies since it may provide a new key test for MOND.

multiple-input single-output interference channel, provided that only channel
distribution information is known to the transmitters. The problem under
consideration is a probabilistically constrained optimization problem which
maximizes a predefined system utility subject to constraints on rate outage
probability and power budget of each transmitter. Our recent analysis has shown
that the outage-constrained CoBF problem is intricately difficult, e.g.,
NP-hard. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on suboptimal but
computationally efficient algorithms. Specifically, by leveraging on the block
successive upper bound minimization (BSUM) method in optimization, we propose a
Gauss-Seidel type algorithm, called distributed BSUM algorithm, which can
handle differentiable, monotone and concave system utilities. By exploiting a
weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) reformulation, we further propose a
Jocobi-type algorithm, called distributed WMMSE algorithm, which can optimize
the weighted sum rate utility in a fully parallel manner. To provide a
performance benchmark, a relaxed approximation method based on polyblock outer
approximation is also proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed
algorithms are significantly superior to the existing successive convex
approximation method in both performance and computational efficiency, and can
yield promising approximation performance.

The interferometric data are combined with the data obtained with the Nobeyama
45-m telescope to recover the total-flux. The target fields of the observations
cover the molecular bar and part of the spiral arms, with a spatial resolution
of ~110 pc x 260 pc. By exploiting the resolution and sensitivity to extended
CO emission, the impact of the galactic structures on the molecular gas content
is investigated in terms of the gas kinematics and the star formation. By
inspecting the gas kinematics, the pattern speed of the bar is estimated to be
57.4 $\pm$ 2.8 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, which places the corotation radius to be
about 1.7 times the semi-major radius of the bar. Within the observed field,
HII regions brighter than 10$^{37.6}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in H{\alpha} luminosity are
found to be preferentially located downstream of the CO emitting regions.
Azimuthal angular offsets between molecular gas and star forming (SF)
calculated with the angular cross-correlation method confirm the trend. By
comparing with a cloud orbit model based on the derived pattern speed, the
angular offsets are found to be in accordance with a time delay of about 10
Myr. Finally, to test whether the arm/bar promote star formation efficiency
(SFE $\equiv$ Star Formation Rate (SFR)/H$_2$ mass), SFR is derived with the
diffuse-background-subtracted H{alpha} and 24{\mu}m images. The arm-to-interarm
ratio of the SFE is found to lie in the range of 2 to 5, while it is ~1 if no
background-removal is performed. The CO-SF offsets and the enhancement of the
SFE in the arm/bar found in the inner region of M83 are in agreement with the
predictions of the classical galactic shock model.

makes very challenging the process of monitoring critical applications and
handling (detecting and recovering) possible failures of servers' data center
that could affect responsiveness and/or reliability of mission critical
applications. Monitoring mechanisms used in data center are usually intrusive
in the sense that they need to install agents on each single server. This has
considerable drawbacks: huge usage of human resources to install and patch the
system and interference with the critical application because agents share
application resources. In order to detect (and possibly predict) failures in
data centers the paper does a first attempt in showing the correlation between
network traffic and servers' power consumption. This is an important step in
deriving non-intrusive monitoring systems, as both network traffic and power

This will improve in its turn the overall resiliency of the data center and its

and $\mathbb{R}^2$ in the work of Kirkpatrick, Schlein, and Staffilani
\cite{KSS}. Our proof relies on an unconditional uniqueness result for the
Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy at the level of regularity $\alpha=1$, which is
proved by using a modification of the techniques from the work of T. Chen,
Hainzl, Pavlovi\'{c} and Seiringer \cite{ChHaPavSei} to the periodic setting.
These techniques are based on the Quantum de Finetti theorem in the formulation
of Ammari and Nier \cite{AmmariNier1,AmmariNier2} and Lewin, Nam, and Rougerie
\cite{LewinNamRougerie}. In order to apply this approach in the periodic
setting, we need to recall multilinear estimates obtained by Herr, Tataru, and
Tzvetkov \cite{HTT}.
  Having proved the unconditional uniqueness result at the level of regularity
$\alpha=1$, we will apply it in order to finish the derivation of the
defocusing cubic nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation on $\mathbb{T}^3$, which
was started in the work of Elgart, Erd\H{o}s, Schlein, and Yau \cite{EESY}. In
the latter work, the authors obtain all the steps of Spohn's strategy for the
derivation of the NLS \cite{Spohn}, except for the final step of uniqueness.
Additional arguments are necessary to show that the objects constructed in
\cite{EESY} satisfy the assumptions of the unconditional uniqueness theorem.
Once we achieve this, we are able to prove the derivation result. In
particular, we show \emph{Propagation of Chaos} for the defocusing
Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy on $\mathbb{T}^3$ for suitably chosen initial data.

symmetries $A_4 \times U(1) \times Z_2 \times Z_2 \times Z_2$. It is the
variant of a model that gives the TBM mixing, with only one more flavon field
included. Furthermore, the imaginary vacuum expectation value (VEV) of this
flavon breaks the imposed CP symmetry and results in $\theta_{23}=45^\circ$ and
the maximal CP violation. This VEV is also helpful for providing a large enough
CP asymmetry required by the leptogenesis mechanism. Besides, this model

the recorded intensity of the particle image pattern superimposed on a variety
of noise sources. The signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) strength governs the
resulting PIV cross correlation and ultimately the accuracy and uncertainty of
the resulting PIV measurement. Hence we posit that correlation SNR metrics
calculated from the correlation plane can be used to quantify the quality of
the correlation and the resulting uncertainty of an individual measurement. In
this paper we present a framework for evaluating the correlation SNR using a
set of different metrics, which in turn are used to develop models for
uncertainty estimation. The SNR metrics and corresponding models presented
herein are expanded to be applicable to both standard and filtered
correlations. In addition, the notion of a valid measurement is redefined with
respect to the correlation peak width in order to be consistent with
uncertainty quantification principles and distinct from an outlier measurement.
Finally the type and significance of the error distribution function is
investigated. These advancements lead to robust uncertainty estimation models,
which are tested against both synthetic benchmark data as well as actual
experimental measurements. For all cases considered here, standard
uncertainties are estimated at the 68.5% confidence level while expanded
uncertainties are estimated at 95% confidence level. For all cases the
resulting calculated coverage factors approximate the expected theoretical
values thus demonstrating the applicability of these new models for estimation
of uncertainty for individual PIV measurements.

Many
different ideas have been proposed to solve this problem. However, there is not
a simple way to do inference even for its simple cases. This paper studies the
special bilinear model $$Y_t=\mu+\phi Y_{t-2}+ bY_{t-2}\varepsilon_{t-1}+

variables with mean zero. We first give a sufficient condition for the
existence of a unique stationary solution for the model and then propose a
GARCH-type maximum likelihood estimator for estimating the unknown parameters.
It is shown that the GMLE is consistent and asymptotically normal under only
finite fourth moment of errors. Also a simple consistent estimator for the
asymptotic covariance is provided. A simulation study confirms the good finite
sample performance. Our estimation approach is novel and nonstandard and it may
provide a new insight for future research in this direction.

In the linear case, we find that there exist two modes with real propagation
constants before an onset of the ${\cal PT}$-symmetry breaking while other
modes have always the propagation constants with nonzero imaginary parts. This
leads to a stable (unstable) propagation of the modes when gain is localized in
the core (ring) of the waveguiding structure. In the case of nonlinear

induces a high degree of instability, with only small windows in the parameter

graphical models using $\ell_{1}$ regularization on the inverse covariance
matrix. Despite recent advances, contemporary applications require methods that
are even faster in order to handle ill-conditioned high dimensional modern day
datasets. In this paper, we propose a new method, G-AMA, to solve the sparse
inverse covariance estimation problem using Alternating Minimization Algorithm
(AMA), that effectively works as a proximal gradient algorithm on the dual
problem. Our approach has several novel advantages over existing methods.
First, we demonstrate that G-AMA is faster than the previous best algorithms by
many orders of magnitude and is thus an ideal approach for modern high
throughput applications. Second, global linear convergence of G-AMA is
demonstrated rigorously, underscoring its good theoretical properties. Third,
the dual algorithm operates on the covariance matrix, and thus easily
facilitates incorporating additional constraints on pairwise/marginal
relationships between feature pairs based on domain specific knowledge. Over
and above estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix, we also illustrate how
to (1) incorporate constraints on the (bivariate) correlations and, (2)
incorporate equality (equisparsity) or linear constraints between individual
inverse covariance elements. Fourth, we also show that G-AMA is better adept at
handling extremely ill-conditioned problems, as is often the case with real
data. The methodology is demonstrated on both simulated and real datasets to
illustrate its superior performance over recently proposed methods.

triple parameters is shown to be more precise than the commonly used pair
parameterization. Simulated annealing provides comprehensive data on the
energetics, structure and stoichiometry of nm-size clusters at T=0. The results
are fully consistent with the experimental finding of negligible coarsening and
a high dispersion of the clusters, with the observation that the presence of Ti
reduces the cluster size, and with the reported radiation tolerance of the
clusters. In alloys without vacancies clusters show a planar structure, whereas
the presence of vacancies leads to three-dimensional configurations.
Additionally, Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations are carried out at high
temperature in order to investigate the dependence of nanocluster composition
on temperature. A good agreement between the existing experimental data on the
ratios (Y+Ti):O, Y:Ti, (Y+Cr):O, and Y:Cr, and the simulation results is found.
In some cases it is even possible to draw the conclusion that the respective
alloys contained a certain amount of vacancies, and that the clusters analyzed
were frozen-in high-temperature configurations. The comparison of experimental
data with those obtained by simulations demonstrates that the assumption of
nanoclusters consisting of nonstoichiometric oxides which are essentially
coherent with the bcc lattice of the Fe-Cr matrix leads to reasonable results.

wood particles are determined for use in a discrete element model (DEM) for
flow analysis in silos, and some methods are proposed for determining such
parameters. The parameters arrived at here have also formed part of the input
to the SPOLY software, developed in-house to compute the DEM model with
spheropolyhedron elements. The model is validated using a 2D physical model,
where prismatic particles with polygonal cross sections are placed inside a
silo with variable aperture and hopper angle. Validation includes comparison of
flow-rates computed by SPOLY, displacement profiles, and clogging thresholds
with experimental results. The good agreement that emerges will encourage
future use of miniature triaxial tests, grain-surface profilometry, inclined
slope tests, and numerical analysis of the intragranular stresses - toward a
direct construction of the contact-deformation relations required in realistic
DEM modelling of particle flow with angular-shaped particles.

distribution $p_n(t_m)$ that $n$ electrons have flown through the system in
measuring time $t_m$. The cumulant generating function (CGF) of this
distribution $F(\chi,t_m)$ has been well studied in the long time limit
$t_m\rightarrow \infty$, however there are relatively few results on the finite
measuring time corrections to this. In this work, we study the leading finite
time corrections to the CGF of interacting Fermi systems with a single
transmission channel at zero temperature but driven out of equilibrium by a
bias voltage. We conjecture that the leading finite time corrections are
logarithmic in $t_m$ with a coefficient universally related to the long time
limit. We provide detailed numerical evidence for this with reference to the
self-dual interacting resonant level model. This model further contains a phase
transition associated with the fractionalisation of charge at a critical bias
voltage. This transition manifests itself technically as branch points in the
CGF. We provide numerical results of the dependence of the CGF on measuring
time for model parameters in the vicinity of this transition, and thus identify
features in the time evolution associated with the phase transition itself.

astrophysical limit of very large magnetic Reynolds number. We consider
kinematic dynamo action for a system consisting of helical flow and large-scale
shear. We demonstrate that large-scale dynamo waves persist at high $Rm$ if the
helical flow is characterised by a narrow band of spatial scales and the shear
is large enough. However for a wide band of scales the dynamo becomes
small-scale with a further increase of $Rm$, with dynamo waves re-emerging only
if the shear is then increased. We show that at high $Rm$ the key effect of the
shear is to suppress small-scale dynamo action, allowing large-scale dynamo
action to be observed. We conjecture that this supports a general ""suppression
principle"" --- large-scale dynamo action can only be observed if there is a
mechanism that suppresses the small-scale fluctuations.

programmers in many ways. Unfortunately, all ""good"" explanations of categories
so far have been designed by mathematicians, or at least theoreticians with a
strong background in mathematics, and this makes categories especially
inscrutable to external audiences. More specifically, the common explanatory
route to approach categories is usually: ""here is a formal specification of
what a category is; then look at these known things from maths and theoretical
computer science, and admire how they can be described using the notions of
category theory."" This approach is only successful if the audience can fully
understand a conceptual object using only its formal specification. In
practice, quite a few people only adopt conceptual objects by abstracting from
two or more contexts where the concepts are applicable, instead. This is the
road taken below: reconstruct the abstractions from category theory using
scratches of understanding from various fields of computer engineering.

extended as a line bundle on a toroidal compactification of the variety, in
such a way that the metric acquires only logarithmic singularities. This result
is the key of being able to compute arithmetic intersection numbers from these

for line bundles on mixed Shimura varieties.
  In this paper we examine the simplest case, namely the sheaf of Jacobi forms
on the universal elliptic curve. We show that Mumford's result cannot be
extended directly to this case and that a new interesting kind of singularities

  By using the theory of b-divisors, we show that an analogue of Mumford's

\k{appa}[10-1], is large and markedly suppressed by the application of magnetic
field, indicating that there is a large contribution of spinons to
\k{appa}[10-1] and that the spin chains run along the [10-1] direction. The
maximum value of the thermal conductivity due to spinons is ~14 W/Km along the
[10-1] direction, supporting the empirical law that the magnitude of the
thermal conductivity due to spinons is roughly proportional to the
antiferromagnetic interaction between the nearest neighboring spins.

subsequently identified as a magnetar. However there is currently no consenus
on the formation channel(s) of these objects. The presence of a magnetar in the
starburst cluster Westerlund 1 implies a >40Msun progenitor, favouring
formation in a binary that was disrupted at supernova. To test this hypothesis
we searched for the putative pre-SN companion via a radial velocity survey to
identify high-velocity runaways, with subsequent atmospheric analysis of the
resultant candidate, Wd1-5. Wd1-5 appears overluminous for its spectroscopic
mass and we find evidence of He- and N-enrichment, O-depletion, and critically
C-enrichment, a combination of properties that is difficult to explain for a
single star. We infer a pre-SN history for Wd1-5 which supposes an initial
close binary comprising two stars of comparable (~41Msun+35Msun) masses.
Efficient mass transfer from the initially more massive component leads to the
mass-gainer evolving more rapidly, initiating luminous blue variable/common
envelope evolution. Reverse, wind-driven mass transfer during its subsequent WC
Wolf-Rayet phase leads to the carbon pollution of Wd1-5, before a type Ibc
supernova disrupts the binary system. Under the assumption of a physical
association between Wd1-5 and J1647-45, the secondary is identified as the
magnetar progenitor; its common envelope evolutionary phase prevents spin-down
of its core prior to SN and the seed magnetic field for the magnetar forms
either in this phase or during the earlier episode of mass transfer in which it
was spun-up. Our results suggest that binarity is a key ingredient in the
formation of at least a subset of magnetars by preventing spin-down via
core-coupling and potentially generating a seed magnetic field.

continued to complex values, spinors, vectors and tensors keep the components
they have in the physical dimension, therefore the $\gamma $ matrices are the
standard ones. Propagators are regularized with the help of evanescent
higher-derivative kinetic terms, which are of the Majorana type in the case of
chiral fermions. If the new terms are organized in a clever way, weighted power
counting provides an efficient control on the renormalization of the theory,
and allows us to show that the resulting chiral dimensional regularization is
consistent to all orders. The new technique considerably simplifies the proofs
of properties that hold to all orders, and makes them suitable to be
generalized to wider classes of models. Typical examples are the
renormalizability of chiral gauge theories and the Adler-Bardeen theorem. The
difficulty of explicit computations, on the other hand, may increase.

multivariate function from a collection of pointwise samples of its Fourier
transform taken nonuniformly. We do this by using the concept of weighted
Fourier frames. A seminal result of Beurling shows that sample points give rise
to a classical Fourier frame provided they are relatively separated and of
sufficient density. However, this result does not allow for arbitrary
clustering of sample points, as is often the case in practice. Whilst keeping
the density condition sharp and dimension independent, our first result removes
the separation condition and shows that density alone suffices. However, this
result does not lead to estimates for the frame bounds. A known result of
Groechenig provides explicit estimates, but only subject to a density condition
that deteriorates linearly with dimension. In our second result we improve
these bounds by reducing the dimension dependence. In particular, we provide
explicit frame bounds which are dimensionless for functions having compact
support contained in a sphere. Next, we demonstrate how our two main results
give new insight into a reconstruction algorithm---based on the existing
generalized sampling framework---that allows for stable and quasi-optimal
reconstruction in any particular basis from a finite collection of samples.
Finally, we construct sufficiently dense sampling schemes that are often used
in practice---jittered, radial and spiral sampling schemes---and provide
several examples illustrating the effectiveness of our approach when tested on
these schemes.

elucidate a rich phase structure in the space spanned by the $S^1$
compactification scale $L$, twisted fermionic boundary condition $\phi$ and the
fermion mass $m$. We found various phases with or without chiral and center
symmetry breaking, separated by first- and second-order phase transitions,
which in specific limits ($\phi=0$, $\phi=\pi$, $L\to 0$ and $m\to \infty$)
reproduce known results in the literature. In the center-symmetric phase at
small $L$, we show that Unsal's bion-induced confinement mechanism is at work
but is substantially weakened at $\phi\ne 0$ by a linear potential between
monopoles. Through an analytic and numerical study of the PNJL model, we show
that the order parameters for center and chiral symmetries (i.e., Polyakov loop
and chiral condensate) are strongly intertwined at $\phi\ne 0$. Due to this
correlation, a deconfined phase can intervene between a weak-coupling
center-symmetric phase at small $L$ and a strong-coupling one at large $L$.
Whether this happens or not depends on the ratio of the dynamical fermion mass
to the energy scale of the Yang-Mills theory. Implication of this possibility
for resurgence in gauge theories is briefly discussed. In an appendix, we study
the index of the adjoint Dirac operator on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$ with
twisted boundary conditions, which is important for semiclassical analysis of
monopoles.

optical spectroscopy at t-t0=16.1 d, which covers rest-frame 3000-6250
Angstroms. Based on Fe II (5169) and Si (II) (6355), our spectrum indicates an
unusually low expansion velocity of 4000-6350 km/s, the lowest ever measured
for a GRB-SN. Additionally, we determined the brightness and shape of each
accompanying SN relative to a template supernova (SN 1998bw), which were used
to estimate the amount of nickel produced via nucleosynthesis during each
explosion. We find that our derived nickel masses are typical of other GRB-SNe,
and greater than those of SNe Ibc that are not associated with GRBs. For GRB
130831A / SN 2013fu, we use our well-sampled R-band light curve (LC) to
estimate the amount of ejecta mass and the kinetic energy of the SN, finding
that these too are similar to other GRB-SNe. For GRB 130215A, we take advantage
of contemporaneous optical/NIR observations to construct an optical/NIR
bolometric LC of the afterglow. We fit the bolometric LC with the millisecond
magnetar model of Zhang & Meszaros (2001), which considers dipole radiation as
a source of energy injection to the forward shock powering the optical/NIR
afterglow. Using this model we derive an initial spin period of P=12 ms and a
magnetic field of B=1.1 x 10^15 G, which are commensurate with those found for
proposed magnetar central engines of other long-duration GRBs.

case-study, we continuously track the RSS feeds of Irish Times news articles

that assigns hashtags to each article, based on its Twitter echo. We propose a
machine learning approach for classifying and ranking article-hashtag pairs.

some of them have already been discarded; more than 200 have been confirmed by
follow-up observations, and several hundreds have been validated. However, most
of them are still awaiting for confirmation. Thus, priorities (in terms of the
probability of the candidate being a real planet) must be established for
subsequent observations. The motivation of this work is to provide a set of
isolated (good) host candidates to be further tested by other techniques. We
identify close companions of the candidates that could have contaminated the
light curve of the planet host. We used the AstraLux North instrument located
at the 2.2 m telescope in the Calar Alto Observatory to obtain
diffraction-limited images of 174 Kepler objects of interest. The lucky-imaging
technique used in this work is compared to other AO and speckle imaging
observations of Kepler planet host candidates. We define a new parameter, the
blended source confidence level (BSC), to assess the probability of an object
to have blended non-detected eclipsing binaries capable of producing the
detected transit. We find that 67.2% of the observed Kepler hosts are isolated
within our detectability limits, and 32.8% have at least one visual companion
at angular separations below 6 arcsec. We find close companions (below 3
arcsec) for the 17.2% of the sample. The planet properties of this sample of
non-isolated hosts are revised. We report one possible S-type binary
(KOI-3158). We also report three possible false positives (KOIs 1230.01,
3649.01, and 3886.01) due to the presence of close companions. The BSC
parameter is calculated for all the isolated targets and compared to both the
value prior to any high-resolution image and, when possible, to observations
from previous high-spatial resolution surveys in the Kepler sample.

ranges and gradients, which is typical of many blood-contacting medical

repulsive in a broad temperature range, changes into attraction at high
temperatures. This leads to a remarkable confinement effect: near the ordering
temperature skyrmions exist only as bound states. The confined skyrmions as
discernible units may arrange in different mesophases. The confinement of
multiple skyrmions is a consequence of the coupling between the magnitude and
the angular part of the order parameter. Thus, near the ordering transitions, I
consider the local magnetization not only as multiply twisted but also
longitudinally modulated. From numerical investigations on 2D models of
isotropic chiral ferromagnets, a staggered half-skyrmion square lattice at zero
and low fields and a hexagonal skyrmion lattice at larger fields are found in
overlapping regions of the phase diagram near the transition temperature. The
creation of skyrmions as stable units and their condensation into different

disagreements---has received wide-spread attention from both theoretical and
applied communities over the past several decades, including combinatorics,
computer vision, and connectomics. Its attention can be partially attributed to
its computational difficulty. Although many heuristics have previously been
proposed in the literature to approximately solve graph matching, very few have
any theoretical support for their performance. A common technique is to relax
the discrete problem to a continuous problem, therefore enabling practitioners
to bring gradient-descent-type algorithms to bear. We prove that an indefinite
relaxation (when solved exactly) almost always discovers the optimal
permutation, while a common convex relaxation almost always fails to discover
the optimal permutation. These theoretical results suggest that initializing
the indefinite algorithm with the convex optimum might yield improved practical
performance. Indeed, experimental results illuminate and corroborate these
theoretical findings, demonstrating that excellent results are achieved in both
benchmark and real data problems by amalgamating the two approaches.

events comprises 3718 unique events from years 2001--2009, with 1409 not
detected before in real-time by the Early Warning System of the Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). The search pipeline makes use of
Machine Learning algorithms in order to help find rare phenomena among 150
million objects and derive the detection efficiency. Applications of the
catalog can be numerous, from analyzing individual events to large statistical
studies for the Galactic mass and kinematics distributions and planetary
abundances.
  We derive the maps of the mean Einstein ring crossing time of events spanning
31 sq. deg. toward of the Galactic Center and compare the observed
distributions with the most recent models. We find good agreement within the
observed region and we see the signature of the tilt of the bar in the
microlensing data. However, the asymmetry of the mean time-scales seems to rise
more steeply than predictions, indicating either a somewhat different
orientation of the bar or a larger bar width. The map for the events with
sources in the Galactic bulge shows a dependence of the mean time-scale on the
Galactic latitude, signaling an increasing contribution from disk lenses closer
to the plane, related with the height of the disk. Our data present a perfect
set for comparing and enhancing new models of the central parts of the Milky
Way and creating the 3D picture of the Galaxy.

dissertation is composed of three chapters and a list of appendices. Chapter 1
serves as an unpretentious and rather general introduction to the field of
asteroseismology of solar-like stars. It starts with a historical account of
the field of asteroseismology followed by a general review of the basic physics
and properties of stellar pulsations. Emphasis is then naturally placed on the
stochastic excitation of stellar oscillations and on the potential of
asteroseismic inference. The chapter closes with a discussion about
observational techniques and the observational status of the field. Chapter 2
is devoted to the subject of data analysis in asteroseismology. This is an
extensive subject, therefore, a compilation is presented of the relevant data
analysis methods and techniques employed contemporarily in asteroseismology of
solar-like stars. Special attention has been drawn to the subject of
statistical inference both from the competing Bayesian and frequentist
perspectives. The chapter ends with a description of the implementation of a
pipeline for mode parameter analysis of Kepler data. In the course of these two
first chapters, reference is made to a series of articles led by the author (or
otherwise having greatly benefited from his contribution) that can be found in
Appendices A to E. Chapter 3 then goes on to present a series of additional
published results.

according to the semi-perimeter is known only for k=1,2. We obtain, from a
recursive decomposition, the generating function of the class of k-convex
parallelogram polyominoes, which turns out to be rational. Noting that this
generating function can be expressed in terms of the Fibonacci polynomials, we
describe a bijection between the class of k-parallelogram polyominoes and the
class of planted planar trees having height less than k+3. In the second part
of the thesis we examine the notion of pattern avoidance, which has been
extensively studied for permutations. We introduce the concept of pattern
avoidance in the context of matrices, more precisely permutation matrices and
polyomino matrices. We present definitions analogous to those given for
permutations and in particular we define polyomino classes, i.e. sets downward
closed with respect to the containment relation. So, the study of the old and
new properties of the redefined sets of objects has not only become
interesting, but it has also suggested the study of the associated poset. In
both approaches our results can be used to treat open problems related to
polyominoes as well as other combinatorial objects.

excluded. Using density functional theory-based calculations, we have revisited
the electronic structure of FeGa3 and compared the magnetic (including
correlations) and non-magnetic electronic density of states. Thermopower at
fixed carrier concentrations are calculated using semi-classical Boltzmann
transport theory, and the calculated results match fairly with our experimental
data and exclude the possibility of strong electronic correlations as an
explanation for the low temperature enhancement. Eventually, after a careful
review, we assign the peaks in the thermopower as a manifestation of the
phonon-drag effect, which is supported by thermopower measurements in a
magnetic field.

method from static configurations to dynamical trajectories. In this approach,
ensembles of trajectories are treated in an analogous manner to ensembles of

dynamical observables are interpreted as partition sums, and the statistical
properties of trajectory ensembles are encoded in free-energy functions that
can be obtained through large-deviation methods in a suitable large time limit.
This establishes what one can call a 'thermodynamics of trajectories'. In this
paper we go a step further, and make a first connection to fluctuation theorems
by generalising them to this dynamical context. We show that an effective
'meta-dynamics' in the space of trajectories gives rise to the celebrated
Jarzynski relation connecting an appropriately defined 'meta-work' with changes
in dynamical generating functions. We demonstrate the potential applicability
of this result to computer simulations for two open quantum systems, a
two-level system and the micromaser. We finally discuss the behavior of the

evidence has been accumulating for the necessary involvement of quantum
coherence and entanglement between uniquely arranged chromophores in light
harvesting photosynthetic complexes. Amazingly, the tubulin subunit proteins,

two D numbers is presented. If the exclusive coefficient is one which means
that the hypothesis in the framework of discernment is exclusive of each other
totally, the D combination is degenerated as the classical Dempster combination
rule. Finally, a linguistic variables transformation of D numbers is presented
to make a decision. A numerical example on linguistic evidential decision
making is used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed D numbers theory.

zero-sum matrix games: minimax and Pareto-optimal security payoff vectors. We
characterize the two criteria based on properties similar to the ones that have
been used in the corresponding counterparts in the single criterion case,
although they need to be complemented with two new consistency properties.
Whereas in standard single criterion games minimax and optimal security payffs
coincide, whenever we have multiple criteria these two solution concepts
differ. We provide explanations for the common roots of these two concepts and
highlight the intrinsic differences between them.

observed a global redshift by 0.25 +- 0.05eV with respect to nominally

and comparing results with finite difference time domain simulations, we
determined the near field coupling between the two triangles composing the
bowtie antenna to be 8x stronger when the antenna is on a glass substrate

investigation of the finite temperature phase diagram of the N=1 supersymmetric

many aspects similar to QCD: quark confinement and fermion condensation occur
in the low temperature regime of both theories. A comparison to QCD is

temperature has a mild dependence on the fermion mass. The analysis of the

Taking into account all available relevant information, we exclude at $95$% CL
sizeable deviations of the so-called alignment limit, in which all couplings of
the light CP-even Higgs boson $h$ are Standard-Model-like. While we can set a
lower limit of $240$ GeV on the mass of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson at $95$%
CL, the mass of the heavy CP-even Higgs boson $H$ can be even lighter than
$200$ GeV. The strong constraints on the model parameters also set limits on
the triple Higgs couplings: the $hhh$ coupling in the Two-Higgs-Doublet model
of type II cannot be larger than in the Standard Model, while the $hhH$
coupling can maximally be $2.5$ times the size of the Standard Model $hhh$
coupling, assuming an $H$ mass below $1$ TeV. The selection of benchmark
scenarios which maximize specific effects within the allowed regions for
further collider studies is illustrated for the $H$ branching fraction to
fermions and gauge bosons. As an example, we calculate the cross section of
$gg\to hh$ for four benchmark points and show that a resonant $H$ could enhance
it by almost a factor of $70$ at a centre-of-mass energy of $14$ TeV.

in future wireless networks, dense network deployment will be ubiquitous, for
which co- operation among the access points is critical. Considering the
computational complexity of designing coordinated beamformers for dense
networks, low-complexity and suboptimal precoding strategies are often adopted.
However, it is not clear how much performance loss will be caused. To enable
optimal coordinated beamforming, in this paper, we propose a framework to
design a scalable beamforming algorithm based on the alternative direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) method. Specifically, we first propose to apply
the matrix stuffing technique to transform the original optimization problem to
an equivalent ADMM-compliant problem, which is much more efficient than the
widely-used modeling framework CVX. We will then propose to use the ADMM
algorithm, a.k.a. the operator splitting method, to solve the transformed
ADMM-compliant problem efficiently. In particular, the subproblems of the ADMM
algorithm at each iteration can be solved with closed-forms and in parallel.
Simulation results show that the proposed techniques can result in significant
computational efficiency compared to the state- of-the-art interior-point
solvers. Furthermore, the simulation results demonstrate that the optimal
coordinated beamforming can significantly improve the system performance
compared to sub-optimal zero forcing beamforming.

distributed storage systems. To maintain reliability, when a storage node
fails, a new node should be regenerated by a repair process. Most of the
previous results on the repair problem assume perfect (error-free) links in the
networks. However, in practice, especially in a wireless network, the
transmitted packets (for repair) may be lost due to, e.g., link failure or
buffer overflow. We study the repair problem of distributed storage systems in
packet erasure networks, where a packet loss is modeled as an erasure. The
minimum repair-bandwidth, namely the amount of information sent from the
surviving nodes to the new node, is established under the ideal assumption of
infinite number of packet transmissions. We also study the bandwidth-storage
tradeoffs in erasure networks. Then, the use of repairing storage nodes (nodes
with smaller storage space) is proposed to reduce the repair-bandwidth. We
study the minimal storage of repairing storage nodes. For the case of a finite
number of packet transmissions, the probability of successful repairing is
investigated. We show that the repair with a finite number of packet
transmissions may use much larger bandwidth than the minimum repair-bandwidth.
Finally, we propose a combinatorial optimization problem, which results in the
optimal repair-bandwidth for the given packet erasure probability and finite
packet transmissions.

be independent of the choice of renormalization scheme -- this is the primary
requirement of renormalization group invariance (RGI). Satisfying scheme
invariance is a challenging problem for perturbative QCD (pQCD), since a
truncated perturbation series does not automatically satisfy the requirements
of the renormalization group. Two distinct approaches for satisfying the RGI
principle have been suggested in the literature. One is the ""Principle of
Maximum Conformality"" (PMC) in which the terms associated with the
$\beta$-function are absorbed into the scale of the running coupling at each
perturbative order; its predictions are scheme and scale independent at every
finite order. The other approach is the ""Principle of Minimum Sensitivity""
(PMS), which is based on local RGI; the PMS approach determines the optimal
renormalization scale by requiring the slope of the approximant of an
observable to vanish. In this paper, we present a detailed comparison of the
PMC and PMS procedures by analyzing two physical observables $R_{e+e-}$ and
$\Gamma(H\to b\bar{b})$ up to four-loop order in pQCD. At the four-loop level,
the PMC and PMS predictions for both observables agree within small errors with
those of conventional scale setting assuming a physically-motivated scale, and
each prediction shows small scale dependences. However, the convergence of the
pQCD series at high orders, behaves quite differently: The PMC displays the
best pQCD convergence since it eliminates divergent renormalon terms; in
contrast, the convergence of the PMS prediction is questionable, often even
worse than the conventional prediction based on an arbitrary guess for the
renormalization scale. ......

structures and measurement of their properties (amplitude, phase speed) can be
used to diagnose the plasma conditions in the neighbourhood of the magnetic
structure via magneto-seismology (MS). We aim to reveal properties of the
chromosphere/Transition Region above the sunspot penumbra using this technique.
Hinode observed a sunspot as it was crossing the limb, providing a unique side
on view of the sunspot atmosphere. The presence of large spicule-like jets is
evident in \ion{Ca}{II} H images. The jets are found to support transverse wave
motions that displace the central axis, which can be interpreted as a kink
wave. The properties of a wave event are measured and used to determine the
magnetic and density stratification along the structure. We also measure the
width of the spicule and the intensity profile along the structure. The
measured wave properties reveal an initial rapid increase in amplitude with
height above the solar surface, followed by a decrease in amplitude. The MS
inversion suggests this initial increase corresponds to large changes in
density and magnetic field strength. In addition, we provide the first
measurements of spicule width with height, which confirm that the spicule under
goes rapid expansion. The measured expansion shows good agreement with the
results from the MS. The observed variations in plasma parameters are suggested
to be partly due to the presence of a gravitational stratified, ambient
atmosphere. Combining width measurements with phase speed measurements implies
the observed decrease in wave amplitude at greater heights can be explained by
wave damping. Hence, we provide the first direct evidence of wave damping in
chromospheric spicules and the quality factor of the damping is found to be
significantly smaller than estimated coronal values.

which contains less than 2 prime numbers. The number of prime numbers within
$\eta_{n}$ goes averagely linear with n to infinity. 2. The exact law of the
number $\pi(n)$ of prime numbers smaller or equal to n is given. As an
approximation of that we get the prime number theorem of Gauss for great values
of n. 3. We derive partition laws for $\pi(\eta_{n})$, for the number of twin
primes $\pi_{2}(\eta_{n})$ in quadratic intervals $\eta_{n}$ and for the
multiplicity $\pi_{g}(2n)$ of representations of Goldbach-pairs for a given
even number 2n similiar to the theorem of Gauss. 4. There is no natural number
n>7, which is beginning point of a prime number free interval with a length of
more than 2{*}SQRT(n). 5. It follows, that the number of twin primes goes to
infinity as well as the number of Goldbach-pairs for a given 2n, if n goes to
infinity. 6. Besides this our computation gives new proofs for the prime number
theorem of Gauss.
