glass theory and statistical physics in the study of the K-sat problem. The
introduction of spin glass theory in the study of the random K-sat problem has
indeed left a mark on the field, leading to some groundbreaking descriptions of
the geometry of its solution space, and helping to shed light on why it seems
to be so hard to solve.
  Most of the geometrical intuitions have their roots in the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of spin glass. We'll start Chapter 2 by
introducing the model from a mathematical perspective, presenting a selection
of rigorous results and giving a first intuition about the cavity method. We'll
then switch to a physical perspective, to explore concepts like pure states,
hierarchical clustering and replica symmetry breaking.
  Chapter 3 will be devoted to the spin glass formulation of K-sat, while the
most important phase transitions of K-sat (clustering, condensation, freezing
and SAT/UNSAT) will be extensively discussed in Chapter 4, with respect their
complexity, free-entropy density and the Parisi 1RSB parameter.
  The concept of algorithmic barrier will be presented in Chapter 5 and
exemplified in detail on the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm. The BP
algorithm will be introduced and motivated, and numerical analysis of a
BP-guided decimation algorithm will be used to show the role of the clustering,
condensation and freezing phase transitions in creating an algorithmic barrier
for BP.
  Taking from the failure of BP in the clustered and condensed phases, Chapter
6 will finally introduce the Cavity Method to deal with the shattering of the
solution space, and present its application to the development of the Survey
Propagation algorithm.

Averaging (CMA) addresses this problem by substituting the single prior over
the models by a set of priors (credal set). Such approach solves the problem of
how to choose the prior over the models and automates sensitivity analysis. We
discuss various CMA algorithms for building an ensemble of logistic regressors
characterized by different sets of covariates. We show how CMA can be
appropriately tuned to the case in which one is prior-ignorant and to the case
in which instead domain knowledge is available. CMA detects prior-dependent
instances, namely instances in which a different class is more probable
depending on the prior over the models. On such instances CMA suspends the
judgment, returning multiple classes. We thoroughly compare different BMA and
CMA variants on a real case study, predicting presence of Alpine marmot burrows
in an Alpine valley. We find that BMA is almost a random guesser on the
instances recognized as prior-dependent by CMA.

the variation among the different estimates obtained using TMD evolution is
much smaller than between these on one hand and the estimates obtained using

overall reduction in asymmetries compared to the ones obtained without it, they
remain sizable. Overall, upon use of TMD evolution, predictions for asymmetries

Generally speaking, spectroscopic techniques are used in conjunction with
empirical and ab-initio calculations in order to elucidate structure. These
experimental and computational methods typically require significant human
input and interpretation, particularly with regards to novel materials.
Recently, the application of data mining and machine learning to problems in
material science have shown great promise in reducing this overhead. In the
work presented here, several aspects of machine learning are explored with
regards to characterizing a model material, titania, using solid-state Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Specifically, a large dataset is generated,
corresponding to NMR $^{47}$Ti spectra, using ab-initio calculations for
generated TiO$_2$ structures. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) reveals that
input spectra may be compressed by more than 90%, before being used for
subsequent machine learning. Two key methods are used to learn the complex
mapping between structural details and input NMR spectra, demonstrating
excellent accuracy when presented with test sample spectra. This work compares
Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), as one
step towards the construction of an expert system for solid state materials

Taking advantage of the unprecedented depth provided by HST/ACS observations in
three passbands, we identify 51 new multiply imaged galaxies, quadrupling the
previous census and bringing the grand total to 68, comprising 194 individual
lensed images. Having selected a subset of the 57 most securely identified
multiply imaged galaxies, we use the Lenstool software package to constrain a
lens model comprised of two cluster-scale dark-matter halos and 98 galaxy-scale
halos. Our best-fit model predicts image positions with an $RMS$ error of
0.68'', which constitutes an improvement of almost a factor of two over
previous, pre-HFF models of this cluster. We find the total projected mass
inside a 200~kpc aperture to be $(1.60\pm0.01)\times 10^{14}\ M_\odot$, a
measurement that offers a three-fold improvement in precision, reaching the
percent level for the first time in any cluster. Finally, we quantify the
increase in precision of the derived gravitational magnification of
high-redshift galaxies and find an improvement by a factor of $\sim$2.5 in the
statistical uncertainty. Our findings impressively confirm that HFF imaging has
indeed opened the domain of high-precision mass measurements for massive
clusters of galaxies.

oscillatory system which can be reconstituted outside the cell and which
displays sustained periodic dynamics in various molecular state variables.
Despite many recent experimental and theoretical studies there are several open
questions regarding the central mechanism(s) responsible for creating this ~24
hour clock in terms of molecular assembly/disassembly of the proteins and
site-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of KaiC monomers.
Simulations of protein-protein interactions and phosphorylation reactions
constrained by analytical fits to partial reaction experimental data support
the central mechanism of oscillation as KaiB-induced KaiA sequestration in
KaiABC complexes associated with the extent of Ser431 phosphorylation in KaiC
hexamers. A simple two-state deterministic model in terms of the degree of
phosphorylation of Ser431 and Thr432 sites alone can reproduce the previously
observed circadian oscillation in the four population monomer phosphoforms in
terms of waveform, amplitude and phase. This suggests that a cyclic
phosphorylation scheme (involving cooperativity between adjacent Ser431 and
Thr432 sites) is not necessary for creating oscillations. Direct simulations of
the clock predict the minimum number of serine-only monomer subunits associated
with KaiA sequestration and release, highlight the role of monomer exchange in
rapid synchronization, and predict the average number of KaiA dimers
sequestered per KaiC hexamer.

required. In such a case, flavor symmetry plays an important role for the

Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) radii by the ALICE collaboration. Azimuthal
anisotropy coefficients v_n generated by combining the early time Glasma

agreement with experimental data for a wide range of centralities. In
particular, event-by-event distributions of the v_n agree with the experimental
data out to fairly peripheral centrality bins. In striking contrast, our
results for p+Pb collisions significantly underestimate the magnitude and do
not reproduce the centrality dependence of data for v_2 and v_3 coefficients.
We argue that the measured v_n data and HBT radii strongly constrain the shapes
of initial parton distributions across system sizes that would be compatible
with a flow interpretation in p+Pb collisions. Alternately, additional sources
of correlations may be required to describe the systematics of long range

primordial density perturbations using this argument. However, the notion of a
separate-universe scale still applies and it places an important upper limit on
the mass of primordial black holes forming at any epoch. We calculate this
scale for equations of state of the form $p = k \rho c^2$ with $-1 <k <

criticisms. For $-1/3 < k < \infty$, the scale is always of order the
cosmological particle horizon size, with a numerical factor depending on $k$.
This confirms the earlier claim that a primordial black hole cannot be much
larger than the particle horizon at formation. For $-1 < k< -1/3$, as expected
for some periods in the history of the universe, the situation changes
radically, in that a sufficiently large positive-curvature region produces a
baby universe rather than a black hole. There is still a separate-universe

the data-points is from a molecular diffusion context; the remaining data from
geophysical turbulence display an unequivocal non-local scaling, $K \sim

been re-examined, leading to a new theory based upon the principle that both
local and non-local diffusional processes govern pair diffusion in homogeneous
turbulence. Through a novel mathematical approach the theory is developed in
the context of generalised power law energy spectra, $E(k)\sim k^{-p}$ for
$1<p\le 3$, over extended inertial subranges. The theory predicts the scaling,
$K(p)\sim \sigma_l^{\gamma_p}$, with $\gamma_p$ intermediate between the purely
local and the purely non-local scalings, i.e. $(1+p)/2<\gamma_p\le 2$. A

systematic study of $K_S^0$ and $K^{*0}$ meson production at midrapidity in
$p$$+$$p$, $d$$+$Au, and Cu$+$Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV. The
$K_S^0$ and $K^{*0}$ mesons are reconstructed via their $K_S^0 \rightarrow
\pi^0(\rightarrow \gamma\gamma)\pi^0(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma)$ and $K^{*0}
\rightarrow K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$ decay modes, respectively. The measured
transverse-momentum spectra are used to determine the nuclear modification
factor of $K_S^0$ and $K^{*0}$ mesons in $d$$+$Au and Cu$+$Cu collisions at
different centralities. In the $d$$+$Au collisions, the nuclear modification
factor of $K_S^0$ and $K^{*0}$ mesons is almost constant as a function of
transverse momentum and is consistent with unity showing that
cold-nuclear-matter effects do not play a significant role in the measured
kinematic range. In Cu$+$Cu collisions, within the uncertainties no nuclear
modification is registered in peripheral collisions. In central collisions,
both mesons show suppression relative to the expectations from the $p$$+$$p$
yield scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions in the Cu$+$Cu
system. In the $p_T$ range 2--5 GeV/$c$, the strange mesons ($K_S^0$, $K^{*0}$)
similarly to the $\phi$ meson with hidden strangeness, show an intermediate
suppression between the more suppressed light quark mesons ($\pi^0$) and the
nonsuppressed baryons ($p$, $\bar{p}$). At higher transverse momentum, $p_T>5$
GeV/$c$, production of all particles is similarly suppressed by a factor of
$\approx$ 2.

  information on general alphabets",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the basic tenets in information theory, the data processing inequality
states that output divergence does not exceed the input divergence for any
channel. For channels without input constraints, various estimates on the
amount of such contraction are known, Dobrushin's coefficient for the total
variation being perhaps the most well-known. This work investigates channels
with average input cost constraint. It is found that while the contraction
coefficient typically equals one (no contraction), the information nevertheless
dissipates. A certain non-linear function, the \emph{Dobrushin curve} of the
channel, is proposed to quantify the amount of dissipation. Tools for
evaluating the Dobrushin curve of additive-noise channels are developed based
on coupling arguments. Some basic applications in stochastic control,
uniqueness of Gibbs measures and fundamental limits of noisy circuits are
discussed.
  As an application, it shown that in the chain of $n$ power-constrained relays
and Gaussian channels the end-to-end mutual information and maximal squared
correlation decay as $\Theta(\frac{\log\log n}{\log n})$, which is in stark
contrast with the exponential decay in chains of discrete channels. Similarly,
the behavior of noisy circuits (composed of gates with bounded fan-in) and
broadcasting of information on trees (of bounded degree) does not experience
threshold behavior in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Namely, unlike the case
of discrete channels, the probability of bit error stays bounded away from
$1\over 2$ regardless of the SNR.

They
also provide limited (but expanding) query languages. Their idiomatic, non-SQL
language constructs, the many variations, and the lack of formal semantics
inhibit deep understanding of the query languages, and also impede progress
towards clean, powerful, declarative query languages.
  This paper specifies the syntax and semantics of SQL++, which is applicable
to both JSON native stores and SQL databases. The SQL++ semi-structured data
model is a superset of both JSON and the SQL data model. SQL++ offers powerful
computational capabilities for processing semi-structured data akin to prior
non-relational query languages, notably OQL and XQuery. Yet, SQL++ is SQL
backwards compatible and is generalized towards JSON by introducing only a
small number of query language extensions to SQL.
  Recognizing that a query language standard is probably premature for the fast
evolving area of NoSQL databases, SQL++ includes configuration options that
formally itemize the semantics variations that language designers may choose
from. The options often pertain to the treatment of semi-structuredness
(missing attributes, heterogeneous types, etc), where more than one sensible
approaches are possible.
  SQL++ is unifying: By appropriate choices of configuration options, the SQL++
semantics can morph into the semantics of existing semi-structured database
query languages. The extensive experimental validation shows how SQL and four
semi-structured database query languages (MongoDB, Cassandra CQL, Couchbase
N1QL and AsterixDB AQL) are formally described by appropriate settings of the
configuration options.
  Early adoption signs of SQL++ are positive: Version 4 of Couchbase's N1QL is
explained as syntactic sugar over SQL++. AsterixDB will soon support the full
SQL++ and Apache Drill is in the process of aligning with SQL++.

In all the cases the near-side strength reflects the collision area covered by
the strings stretched between the colliding objects and therefore it is related
to the shape of their profile functions. The dependence of the pseudorapidty

many hadronic frameworks because of several important aspects not always
present in nonrelativistic models, such as intrinsic Lorentz covariance,
automatic inclusion of spin, appropriate saturation mechanism for nuclear
matter, causality and, therefore, no problems related to superluminal speed of
sound. With the aim of identifying the models which best satisfy well known
properties of nuclear matter, we have analyzed $263$ parameterizations of seven
different types of RMF models under three different sets of constraints related
to symmetric nuclear matter, pure neutron matter, symmetry energy, and its
derivatives. One of these (SET1) is formed of the same constraints used in a
recent work [M. Dutra et al., Phys. Rev. C 85, 035201 (2012)] in which we
analyzed $240$ Skyrme parameterizations. The results pointed to $2$ models
consistent with all constraints. By using another set of constraints, namely,
SET2a, formed by the updated versions of the previous one, we found $4$ models
approved simultaneously. Finally, in the third set, named SET2b, in which the
values of the constraints are more restrictive, we found $3$ consistent models.
Another interesting feature of our analysis is that the results change
dramatically if we do not consider the constraint regarding the volume part of
the isospin incompressibility ($K_{\tau,\rm v}$). In this case, we have $35$
approved models in SET2a and $30$ in SET2b.

matrices also hold for another class of matrices with a certain symmetry in
their Hermitian Schmidt decompositions. These matrices were called SPC in [1]
(definition 1.1). Before that, in [9], T\'oth and G\""uhne proved that if a
state is symmetric then it is PPT if and only if it is SPC. A natural question
appeared: What is the connection between SPC matrices and PPT matrices? Is
every SPC matrix PPT?
  Here we show that every SPC matrix is PPT in $M_2\otimes M_2$ (theorem 4.3).
This theorem is a consequence of the fact that every density matrix in
$M_2\otimes M_m$, with tensor rank smaller or equal to 3, is separable (theorem
3.2). This theorem is a generalization of the same result found in [1] for
tensor rank 2 matrices in $M_k\otimes M_m$. Although, in $M_3\otimes M_3$,
there exists a SPC matrix with tensor rank 3 that is not PPT (proposition 5.2).
We shall also provide a non trivial example of a family of matrices in
$M_k\otimes M_k$, in which both, the SPC and PPT properties, are equivalent
(proposition 6.2). Within this family, there exists a non trivial subfamily in
which the SPC property is equivalent to separability (proposition 6.4).

$k_1\le k\le k_\eta$ with $k_\eta/k_1=10^6$, is investigated numerically using
Kinematic Simulation (Kraichnan 1970, Fung et al 1992). If $\Delta=|{\bf
x_2}(t)-{\bf x}_1(t)|$ and $\sigma_\Delta=\sqrt{\langle\Delta^2\rangle}$, (the
angled brackets is the ensemble average over particle pairs), then we find
that:
  (1) The pair diffusivity scales like $D_p\sim \sigma_\Delta^{\gamma_p}$ with
$\gamma_p$ obtained from the simulations such that $\gamma^l_p<\gamma_p<2$,
where $\gamma^l_p =(1+p)/2$ is the Richardson locality scaling. The range of
$\Delta$ over which these scalings are observed diminishes from above and from
below as $p$ increases towards $3$.\\ (2) $M(p)=\gamma_p/\gamma^l_p>1$ in the
range $1<p<3$, and $M$ has a peak at $p_m\approx 1.8$. This suggests that for
spectra close to this in the range $1.5<p<2$, which includes Kolmogorov
turbulence, local and non-local correlations play comparable roles in the pair
diffusion process.\\ (3) The mean square separation scales like
$\langle\Delta^2\rangle_p \sim \tau_p^{\chi_p}$ where $\chi_p=1/(1-\gamma_p/2)$
and $\tau_p$ is an adjusted travel time.\\ (4) For Kolmogorov turbulence
$p=5/3$, we observe $D_{5/3}\sim \sigma_\Delta^{1.53}$, and
$\langle\Delta^2\rangle_{5/3}\sim\tau^{4.2}$. \\ (5) At $p_*\approx 1.4$
($E(k)\sim k^{-1.4}$) we observe $D_{p_*}\sim\sigma_\Delta^{4/3}$, and
$\langle\Delta^2\rangle_{p_*}\sim\tau^3$; these are different to the Richardson
$4/3$-law and Richardson-Obukov $t^3$-regime which occur for $p=5/3$.
  These results are consistent with Malik's (2014) theory, and supports the
principle upon which the theory is based that both local and non-local
correlations are effective in the pair diffusion process inside the inertial
subrange.

the closest region to the Kormendy relation populated by those pseudobulges

tend to be located in galaxies with the highest likelihood of tidal

growth. Properties of bulges in isolated galaxies contrast with a picture where
pseudobulges grow continuosly via star formation. They also suggest that

NGC 1275 is also detected at TeV energies during the periods of HE gamma-ray
flaring suggests that the short-timescale variation might be primarily related
to changes in the inverse Compton scattering of photons by the electron
population in the jet. The longer-timescale changes suggest a 30--40 year
variation in the fuelling of the black hole, that affects the power of the
inner jet. NCG 1275 is a laboratory for the class of brightest cluster
galaxies, and its variability on these timescales has implications for our
understanding of massive galaxies in cooling-core clusters. The case of NGC
1275 highlights the need for wide coverage across the radio band to correctly
account for the contribution to emission from a synchrotron self-absorbed core

general overview of this monodromy effect and its application to large-field

stabilization during inflation. The resulting inflaton-dependent shifts in the

examples arising in compactifications of type IIB string theory on products of

conduct an asteroseismic analysis of the Kepler photometry and conclude that
the star has an average density of 1.652+/-0.006 g/cm^3. Its mass of
0.911+/-0.033 M_Sun renders it one of the lowest-mass subjects of asteroseismic
study. An analysis of the transit signature produced by the planet Kepler-93b,
which appears with a period of 4.72673978+/-9.7x10^-7 days, returns a
consistent but less precise measurement of the stellar density, 1.72+0.02-0.28
g/cm^3. The agreement of these two values lends credence to the planetary
interpretation of the transit signal. The achromatic transit depth, as compared
between Kepler and the Spitzer Space Telescope, supports the same conclusion.
We observed seven transits of Kepler-93b with Spitzer, three of which we
conducted in a new observing mode. The pointing strategy we employed to gather
this subset of observations halved our uncertainty on the transit radius ratio
R_p/R_star. We find, after folding together the stellar radius measurement of
0.919+/-0.011 R_Sun with the transit depth, a best-fit value for the planetary
radius of 1.481+/-0.019 R_Earth. The uncertainty of 120 km on our measurement
of the planet's size currently renders it one of the most precisely measured
planetary radii outside of the Solar System. Together with the radius, the
planetary mass of 3.8+/-1.5 M_Earth corresponds to a rocky density of 6.3+/-2.6
g/cm^3. After applying a prior on the plausible maximum densities of
similarly-sized worlds between 1--1.5 R_Earth, we find that Kepler-93b
possesses an average density within this group.

dark sector in cosmology. Future surveys will however be both deep and wide and
will thus require an analysis in 3-dimensional spherical geometry. We review
and compare several methods which have been proposed in the literature for this
purpose, focusing in particular on implementations of the spherical harmonic
tomography (SHT) power spectrum $C^{i j}_{l}$ and the spherical Fourier Bessel
(SFB) power spectrum $C_{l} (k, k')$. Using a Fisher analysis, we compare the
forecasted constraints on cosmological parameters using these statistics. These
constraints typically rely on approximations such as the Limber approximation
and make specific choices in the numerical implementation of each statistic.
Using a series of toy models, we explore the applicability of these
approximations and study the sensitivity of the SHT and SFB statistics to the
details of their implementation. In particular, we show that overlapping
redshift bins may improve cosmological constraints using the SHT statistic when
the number of bins is small, and that the SFB constraints are quite robust to
changes in the assumed distance-redshift relation. We also find that the SHT
can be tailored to be more sensitive to modes at redshifts close to the survey
boundary, while the SFB appears better suited to capture information beyond the
smooth shape of the power spectrum. In this context, we discuss the pros and
cons of the different techniques and their impact on the design and analysis of
future wide field spectroscopic surveys.

two brightest cluster galaxies and lenses a background source galaxy into an
arc and a counterimage. With Hubble Space Telescope (HST) grism and Keck/LRIS
spectroscopy, we measure the source redshift to be $z_{\rm S}=2.26$. Using HST
imaging in ACS/F475W, ACS/F814W, WFC3/F125W, and WFC3/F160W, we model the lens

Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) should balance to zero. We use this fact to
constrain new solutions for the solar motion with respect to the LG
centre-of-mass, the total mass of the LG, and the individual masses of M31 and
the MW. Using the set of remote LG galaxies at $>350$ kpc from the MW and M31,
we find that the solar motion has amplitude $V_{\odot}=299\pm 15 {\rm
~km~s^{-1}}$ in a direction pointing toward galactic longitude
$l_{\odot}=98.4^{\circ}\pm 3.6^{\circ}$ and galactic latitude
$b_{\odot}=-5.9^{\circ}\pm 3.0^{\circ}$. The velocities of M31 and the MW in
this rest frame give a direct measurement of their mass ratio, for which we
find $\log_{10} (M_{\rm M31}/M_{\rm MW})=0.36 \pm 0.29$. We combine these
measurements with the virial theorem to estimate the total mass within the LG
as $M_{\rm LG}=(2.5\pm 0.4)\times 10^{12}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$.
  Our value for $M_{\rm LG}$ is consistent with the sum of literature values
for $M_{\rm MW}$ and $M_{\rm M31}$. This suggests that the mass of the LG is
almost entirely located within the two largest galaxies rather than being
dispersed on larger scales or in a background medium. The outskirts of the LG
are seemingly rather empty. Combining our measurement for $M_{\rm LG}$ and the
mass ratio, we estimate the individual masses of the MW and M31 to be $M_{\rm
MW}=(0.8\pm 0.5)\times 10^{12}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ and $M_{\rm M31}=(1.7\pm
0.3)\times 10^{12}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$, respectively. Our analysis favours M31
being more massive than the MW by a factor of $\sim$2.3, and the uncertainties
allow only a small probability (9.8%) that the MW is more massive. This is
consistent with other properties such as the maximum rotational velocities,
total stellar content, and numbers of globular clusters and dwarf satellites,
which all suggest that $M_{\rm M31}/M_{\rm MW}>1$.

UV-SED based star formation tracers in these systems. Our analysis of galaxy
dynamics shows that minor dynamical disruptions (e.g. minor merging) are
generally not enough to cause a deviation from the established 'Main Sequence'
relation. Most galaxies are found to follow the fundamental metallicity
relation (FMR), although with large scatter. One galaxy, (a small satellite
galaxy of a massive companion) is found to deviate strongly from the FMR. This
deviation is in nice agreement with the correlation recently discovered in
local galaxies between gas metallicity and environment, which has been ascribed
to enriched inter-galactic medium (IGM) in dense environments, and therefore
suggests that here the IGM was already significantly enriched by z~1.5.

mixing to lowest-order in the parameter $\kappa = \frac{e^2/\epsilon\ell}{\hbar
v_F/\ell}=\frac{e^2}{\epsilon v_F\hbar}$ which is magnetic field independent
and can only be varied through the choice of substrate. We find Landau level
mixing effects are negligible in the $N=0$ Landau level for $\kappa\lesssim 2$.
In fact, the lowest Landau level projected Coulomb Hamiltonian is a better
approximation to the real Hamiltonian for graphene than it is for semiconductor
based quantum wells. Consequently, the principal fractional quantum Hall states
are expected in the $N=0$ Landau level over this range of $\kappa$. In the
$N=1$ Landau level, fractional quantum Hall states are expected for a smaller
range of $\kappa$ and Landau level mixing strongly breaks particle-hole
symmetry producing qualitatively different results compared to the $N=0$ Landau
level. At half-filling of the $N=1$ Landau level, we predict the anti-Pfaffian
state will occur for $\kappa \sim 0.25$-$0.75$.

whose timescales and luminosities are not easily explained by traditional
supernovae (SN) models. The sample size of these objects has remained small
due, at least in part, to the challenge of detecting short timescale transients
with traditional survey cadences. Here we present the results from a search
within the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1-MDS) for rapidly-evolving and
luminous transients. We identify 10 new transients with a time above
half-maximum of less than 12 days and -16.5 > M > -20 mag. This increases the
number of known events in this region of SN phase space by roughly a factor of
three. The median redshift of the PS1-MDS sample is z=0.275 and they all
exploded in star forming galaxies. In general, the transients possess faster
rise than decline timescale and blue colors at maximum light (g - r < -0.2).
Best fit blackbodies reveal photospheric temperatures/radii that expand/cool
with time and explosion spectra taken near maximum light are dominated by a
blue continuum, consistent with a hot, optically thick, ejecta. We find it
difficult to reconcile the short timescale, high peak luminosity (L > 10^43
erg/s), and lack of UV line blanketing observed in many of these transients
with an explosion powered mainly by the radioactive decay of Ni-56. Rather, we
find that many are consistent with either (1) cooling envelope emission from
the explosion of a star with a low-mass extended envelope which ejected very
little (<0.03 M_sun) radioactive material, or (2) a shock breakout within a
dense, optically thick, wind surrounding the progenitor star. After calculating
the detection efficiency for objects with rapid timescales in the PS1-MDS we
find a volumetric rate of 4800 - 8000 events/yr/Gpc^3 (4-7% of the
core-collapse SN rate at z=0.2).

iron line is detected in the lag spectra on three different time-scales,
allowing the emission from different regions around the black hole to be
separated. Using NuSTAR coverage of energies above 10 keV reveals a lag between
these energies and the primary continuum, which is detected for the first time
in an AGN. This lag is a result of the Compton reflection hump responding to
changes in the primary source in a manner similar to the response of the
relativistic iron K line.

show strong, line-dependent variability on various time scales. Therefore, the
subtraction of the sky background in the affected wavelength regime becomes a
problem if plain sky spectra have to be taken at a different time as the
astronomical data. A solution of this issue is the physically motivated scaling
of the airglow lines in the plain sky data to fit the sky lines in the object
spectrum. We have developed a corresponding instrument-independent approach
based on one-dimensional spectra. Our code skycorr separates sky lines and
sky/object continuum by an iterative approach involving a line finder and
airglow line data. The sky lines are grouped according to their expected
variability. The line groups in the sky data are then scaled to fit the sky in
the science data. Required pixel-specific weights for overlapping groups are
taken from a comprehensive airglow model. Deviations in the wavelength
calibration are corrected by fitting Chebyshev polynomials and rebinning via
asymmetric damped sinc kernels. The scaled sky lines and the sky continuum are
subtracted separately. VLT X-Shooter data covering time intervals from two
minutes to about one year were selected to illustrate the performance. Except
for short time intervals of a few minutes, the sky line residuals were several
times weaker than for sky subtraction without fitting. Further tests show that
skycorr performs consistently better than the method of Davies (2007) developed
for VLT SINFONI data.

an intermediate scale, we propose a new framework for models of split
supersymmetry, in which gauginos acquire intermediate scale Dirac masses of
$\sim 10^{8-11}$ GeV. Scalar masses arise from one-loop finite contributions as
well as direct gravity-mediated contributions. Like split supersymmetry, one
Higgs doublet is fine-tuned to be light. The scale at which the Dirac gauginos
are introduced to make the Higgs quartic zero is the same as is necessary for
gauge coupling unification. Thus, gauge coupling unification persists
(nontrivially, due to adjoint multiplets), though with a somewhat higher
unification scale $\gtrsim 10^{17}$ GeV. The $\mu$-term is naturally at the
weak scale, and provides an opportunity for experimental verification. We
present two manifestations of Split Dirac Supersymmetry. In the ""Pure Dirac""
model, the lightest Higgsino must decay through R-parity violating couplings,
leading to an array of interesting signals in colliders. In the ""Hypercharge
Impure"" model, the bino acquires a Majorana mass that is one-loop suppressed
compared with the Dirac gluino and wino. This leads to weak scale Higgsino dark
matter whose overall mass scale, as well as the mass splitting between the
neutral components, is naturally generated from the same UV dynamics. We
outline the challenges to discovering pseudo-Dirac Higgsino dark matter in

avoids redundancies in relaunching grounder and solver programs and benefits
from the solver's learning capacities. clingo 4 accomplishes this by
complementing ASP's declarative input language by control capacities expressed

clingo 4 offers a new directive that allows for structuring logic programs into

controllable from the procedural side, viz. the scripting languages. By
strictly separating logic and control programs, clingo 4 also abolishes the

avalanches exhibit scale invariant behavior similar to self-organized critical
systems, we study the role of noisy (non-conservative) local dynamics on the
critical behavior of a sandpile model which can be taken to mimic the dynamics
of neuronal avalanches. We find that despite the fact that noise breaks the
strict local conservation required to attain criticality, our system exhibit
true criticality for a wide range of noise in various dimensions, given that
conservation is respected \textit{on the average}. Although the system remains
critical, exhibiting finite-size scaling, the value of critical exponents
change depending on the intensity of local noise. Interestingly, for
sufficiently strong noise level, the critical exponents approach and saturate
at their mean-field values, consistent with empirical measurements of neuronal
avalanches. This is confirmed for both two and three dimensional models.
However, addition of noise does not affect the exponents at the upper critical
dimension ($D=4$). In addition to extensive finite-size scaling analysis of our
systems, we also employ a useful time-series analysis method in order to
establish true criticality of noisy systems. Finally, we discuss the
implications of our work in neuroscience as well as some implications for
general phenomena of criticality in non-equilibrium systems.

homogeneous and isotropic turbulence in rigid aggregates, we estimate
theoretically the rate of turbulent breakup of colloidal aggregates and the
size distribution of the formed fragments. The adopted method combines Direct
Numerical Simulation of the turbulent field with a Discrete Element Method
based on Stokesian dynamics. In this way, not only the mechanics of the
aggregate is modelled in detail, but the internal stresses are evaluated while
the aggregate is moving in the turbulent flow. We examine doublets and
cluster-cluster isostatic aggregates, where the failure of a single contact
leads to the rupture of the aggregate and breakup occurs when the tensile force
at a contact exceeds the cohesive strength of the bond. Due to the different
role of the internal stresses, the functional relationship between breakup
frequency and turbulence dissipation rate is very different in the two cases.
In the limit of very small and very large values, the frequency of breakup
scales exponentially with the turbulence dissipation rate for doublets, while
it follows a power law for cluster-cluster aggregates. For the case of large
isostatic aggregates it is confirmed that the proper scaling length for maximum
stress and breakup is the radius of gyration. The cumulative fragment
distribution function is nearly independent of the mean turbulence dissipation
rate and can be approximated by the sum of a small erosive component and a term
that is quadratic with respect to fragment size.

giants, spread across roughly 37.5 sq. deg, are analysed. The line of sight
velocity field is dominated by the projection of the orbital motion of the SMC
around the LMC/Milky Way. The residuals are inconsistent with both a
non-rotating spheroid and a nearly face on disk system. The current sample and
previous stellar and HI kinematics can be reconciled by rotating disk models
with line of nodes position angle, theta, ~ 120-130 deg., moderate inclination
(i ~ 25-70 deg.), and rotation curves rising at 20-40 km/s/kpc. The metal-poor
stars exhibit a lower velocity gradient and higher velocity dispersion than the
metal-rich stars. If our interpretation of the velocity patterns as bulk
rotation is appropriate, then some revision to simulations of the SMC orbit is
required since these are generally tuned to the SMC disk line-of-nodes lying in
a NE-SW direction. Residuals show strong spatial structure indicative of
non-circular motions that increase in importance with increasing distance from
the SMC centre. Kinematic substructure in the north-west part of our survey
area is associated with the tidal tail or Counter-Bridge predicted by
simulations. Lower line-of-sight velocities towards the Wing and the larger
velocities just beyond the SW end of the SMC Bar are probably associated with
stellar components of the Magellanic Bridge and Counter-Bridge, respectively.
Our results reinforce the notion that the intermediate-age stellar population
of the SMC is subject to substantial stripping by external forces.

$[0,T_{*}]$ is obtained provided that the curl $\omega$ satisfies $\omega\in
L^{1}((0,T);L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R^{\textrm{\ensuremath{3}}}})$ for all
$T<T_{*}$, and the arguments apply equally well to the Navier-Stokes equations
(NSE) in $\mathbb{R^{\mathrm{3}}}$. The spatial $L^{\infty}$-criterion imposed
on the curl was generalized to other function spaces by various authors
({[}9{]}, {[}10{]}, {[}11{]}). In {[}8{]} regularity results of this type are
obtained on localized balls.
  In this paper for the NSE case and on general bounded domains $\Omega$ in
$\mathbb{R^{\mathrm{3}}}$, we obtain a regularity result of BKM type that
allows $\omega$ to be a distribution. Specifically, we show that if $u$ is a
Leray solution of the 3-D NSE on the interval $(0,T)$ and if $\omega\in
L^{s}((0,T);H^{-1,p}(\Omega))$ where $\frac{2}{s}+\frac{3}{p}=1$ for some

particular for $p=\infty$ we have a regular solution when $\omega\in

{[}2{]} by one order of (negative) derivative in terms of the spatial criteria
for regularity. Our results thus impose more stringent conditions on time than
the BKM results and their generalizations described above, but as far as we are

drift rate. In the limiting case of a disk much more massive than the
secondary, the migration rate saturates to a constant which is sensitive to
disk parameters and is not necessarily of order viscous rate. In the opposite
limit of a low-mass disk, the migration rate decreases linearly with disk mass.

can be readily overheard by unauthorized users for interception purposes and is
thus highly vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. To this end, physical-layer
security is emerging as a promising paradigm to protect the wireless
communications against eavesdropping attacks by exploiting the physical
characteristics of wireless channels. This article is focused on the
investigation of diversity techniques to improve the physical-layer security,
differing from the conventional artificial noise generation and beamforming
techniques which typically consume additional power for generating artificial
noise and exhibit high implementation complexity for beamformer design. We
present several diversity approaches to improve the wireless physical-layer
security, including the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), multiuser
diversity, and cooperative diversity. To illustrate the security improvement
through diversity, we propose a case study of exploiting cooperative relays to
assist the signal transmission from source to destination while defending
against eavesdropping attacks. We evaluate the security performance of
cooperative relay transmission in Rayleigh fading environments in terms of
secrecy capacity and intercept probability. It is shown that as the number of
relays increases, the secrecy capacity and intercept probability of the
cooperative relay transmission both improve significantly, implying the
advantage of exploiting cooperative diversity to improve the physical-layer
security against eavesdropping attacks.

the energy 3.55 keV from the galaxy clusters and Andromeda galaxy. We show that
this anomalous signal can be explained in annihilating dark matter model, for
example, fermionic dark matter model in hidden sector with global $U(1)_X$
symmetry proposed by Weinberg. There are two scenarios for the production of
the annihilating dark matters. In the first scenario the dark matters with mass
3.55 keV decouple from the interaction with Goldstone bosons and go out of
thermal equilibrium at high temperature ($>$ 1 TeV) when they are still
relativistic, their number density per comoving volume being essentially fixed
to be the current value. The correct relic abundance of this warm dark matter
is obtained by assuming that about ${\cal O}(10^3)$ relativistic degrees of
freedom were present at the decoupling temperature or alternatively large
entropy production occurred at high temperature. In the other scenario, the
dark matters were absent at high temperature, and as the universe cools down,
the SM particles annihilate or decay to produce the dark matters non-thermally
as in `freeze-in' scenario. It turns out that the DM production from Higgs
decay is the dominant one. In the model we considered, only the first scenario
can explain both X-ray signal and relic abundance. The X-ray signal arises
through $p$-wave annihilation of dark matter pair into two photons through the
scalar resonance without violating the constraints from big bang
nucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave background, and astrophysical objects such as
red giants or white dwarfs. We also discuss the possibility that the signal may
result from a decaying dark matter in a simple extension of Weinberg model.

following a gamma-ray flux enhancement detected by Fermi-LAT on MJD 56483 (2013
July 10) dense follow-up was performed by ten 0.5-2.0 m telescopes in Japan
over one week. The 2-year R_C-band light curve showed clear brightening
corresponding to the gamma-ray flux increase and then decayed gradually. The
high state as a whole lasted for ~20 days, during which we clearly detected
optical polarization from this object. The polarization degree (PD) of the
source increased from 0-1% in quiescence to ~3% at maximum and then declined to
the quiescent level, with the duration of the enhancement of less than 10 days.
The moderate PD around the peak allowed us to precisely measure the daily
polarization angle (PA). As a result, we found that the daily PAs were almost
constant and aligned to the jet axis, suggesting that the magnetic field
direction at the emission region is transverse to the jet. This implies either
a presence of helical/toroidal magnetic field or transverse magnetic field
compressed by shock(s). We also found small-amplitude intra-night variability
during the 2-hour continuous exposure on a single night. We discuss these
findings based on the turbulent multi-zone model recently advocated by Marscher
(2014). Optical to ultraviolet (UV) spectrum showed a rising shape in the
higher frequency and the UV magnitude measured by Swift/UVOT was steady even
during the flaring state, suggesting that thermal emission from accretion disk
is dominant in that band.

avoids expensive computational operations. In addition, we analyze its main

Moreover, as a block version of GCROT($m,k$), the new method inherits the

shock problem and the recent lithium ion battery, the maximum diffusion induced
stress (DIS) is a very important quantity. However a widely accepted, accurate
and easy-to-use quantitative formula on it still lacks. In this paper, by
normalizing the governing equations, an almost analytical model is developed,
except a single-variable function of the dimensionless Biot number which cannot
be determined analytically and is then given by a curve. Formulae for various
typical geometries and working conditions are presented. If the stress and the
diffusion process are fully coupled (i.e. stress-dependent diffusion), as in
lithium ion diffusion, the normalized maximum DIS can be characterized by a
two-variable function of a dimensionless coupling parameter and the Biot
number, which is obtained numerically and presented in contour plots. Moreover,
it is interesting to note that these two parameters, within a wide range, can
be further approximately combined into a single dimensionless parameter to
characterize the maximum DIS. These formulae together with curves/contours
provide engineers and materialists a simple and easy way to quickly obtain the
stress and verify the reliability of materials under various typical diffusion
conditions. Via energy balance analysis, the model of diffusion induced
fracture is also developed. It interestingly predicts that the spacing of
diffusion induced cracks is constant, independent of the thickness of specimen
and the concentration difference. Our thermal shock experiments on alumina
plates validate these qualitative and quantitative theoretical predictions,
such as the constant crack spacing and the predicted critical temperature
difference at which the cracks initiate. Furthermore, the proposed model can
interpret the observed hierarchical crack patterns.

validation of skeletal mechanisms for a three-component toluene reference fuel.
Using the directed relation graph with error propagation and sensitivity
analysis method followed by a further unimportant reaction elimination stage,
skeletal mechanisms valid over comprehensive and high-temperature ranges of
conditions were developed at varying levels of detail. These skeletal
mechanisms were generated based on autoignition simulations, and validation
using ignition delay predictions showed good agreement with the detailed
mechanism in the target range of conditions. When validated using phenomena
other than autoignition, such as perfectly stirred reactor and laminar flame
propagation, tight error control or more restrictions on the reduction during
the sensitivity analysis stage were needed to ensure good agreement. In
addition, tight error limits were needed for close prediction of ignition delay
when varying the mixture composition away from that used for the reduction. In
homogeneous compression-ignition engine simulations, the skeletal mechanisms
closely matched the point of ignition and accurately predicted species profiles
for lean to stoichiometric conditions. Furthermore, the efficacy of generating
a multicomponent skeletal mechanism was compared to combining skeletal
mechanisms produced separately for neat fuel components; using the same error
limits, the latter resulted in a larger skeletal mechanism size that also
lacked important cross reactions between fuel components. Based on the present
results, general guidelines for reducing detailed mechanisms for multicomponent
fuels are discussed.

harmonic analysis and compressed sensing have turned out to be very successful.
One key ingredient is a carefully chosen representation system which provides
(optimally) sparse approximations of the original image. Due to the common
assumption that images are typically governed by anisotropic features,
directional representation systems have often been utilized. One prominent
example of this class are shearlets, which have the additional benefitallowing
faithful implementations. Numerical results show that shearlets significantly
outperform wavelets in inpainting tasks. One of those software packages,
www.shearlab.org, even offers the flexibility of usingdifferent parameter for
each scale, which is not yet covered by shearlet theory.
  In this paper, we first introduce universal shearlet systems which are
associated with an arbitrary scaling sequence, thereby modeling the previously
mentioned flexibility. In addition, this novel construction allows for a smooth
transition between wavelets and shearlets and therefore enables us to analyze
them in a uniform fashion. For a large class of such scaling sequences, we
first prove that the associated universal shearlet systems form band-limited
Parseval frames for $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ consisting of Schwartz functions.
Secondly, we analyze the performance for inpainting of this class of universal
shearlet systems within a distributional model situation using an
$\ell^1$-analysis minimization algorithm for reconstruction. Our main result in
this part states that, provided the scaling sequence is comparable to the size
of the (scale-dependent) gap, nearly-perfect inpainting is achieved at
sufficiently fine scales.

grand-canonical Gibbs state of the ensemble formulation. A single realization
of the gTPQ state gives all quantities of statistical-mechanical interest, with
exponentially small probability of error. This formulation not only sheds new
light on quantum statistical mechanics but also is useful for practical
computations. As an illustration, we apply it to the Hubbard model, on a
one-dimensional (1d) chain and on a two-dimensional (2d) triangular lattice.
For the 1d chain, our results agree well with the exact solutions over wide
ranges of temperature, chemical potential and the on-site interaction. For the
2d triangular lattice, for which exact results are unknown, we obtain reliable
results over a wide range of temperature. We also find that finite-size effects
are much smaller in the gTPQ state than in the canonical TPQ (cTPQ) state. This
also shows that in the ensemble formulation the grand-canonical Gibbs state of

approximation of stochastic models that are described in terms of differential
equations either driven by random measures or with random coefficients. The
MIMC method is both a stochastic version of the combination technique
introduced by Zenger, Griebel and collaborators and an extension of the
Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method first described by Heinrich and Giles.
Inspired by Giles's seminal work, we use in MIMC high-order mixed differences
instead of using first-order differences as in MLMC to reduce the variance of
the hierarchical differences dramatically. This in turn yields new and improved
complexity results, which are natural generalizations of Giles's MLMC analysis
and which increase the domain of the problem parameters for which we achieve
the optimal convergence, $\mathcal{O}(\text{TOL}^{-2}).$ Moreover, in MIMC, the
rate of increase of required memory with respect to $\text{TOL}$ is independent
of the number of directions up to a logarithmic term which allows far more
accurate solutions to be calculated for higher dimensions than what is possible
when using MLMC.
  We motivate the setting of MIMC by first focusing on a simple full tensor
index set. We then propose a systematic construction of optimal sets of indices
for MIMC based on properly defined profits that in turn depend on the average
cost per sample and the corresponding weak error and variance. Under standard
assumptions on the convergence rates of the weak error, variance and work per
sample, the optimal index set turns out to be the total degree (TD) type. In
some cases, using optimal index sets, MIMC achieves a better rate for the
computational complexity than the corresponding rate when using full tensor
index sets...

Here these modes are directly calculated from Maxwell's equations expressed in

current distribution with a scalar impedance function, simple yet accurate
models of scatterers are constructed which describe their response to an
arbitrary incident field over a broad bandwidth. These models generalize both
equivalent-dipole and and equivalent-circuit models to finite sized structures

ambient-light sensor employed in today's mobile devices. The pervasive usage of
mobile devices, i.e., smartphones and tablet computers and their vast amount of
sensors represent a plethora of side channels posing a serious threat to the
user's privacy and security. While recent advances in this area of research
focused on the employed motion sensors and the camera as well as the sound, we
investigate a less obvious source of information leakage, namely the ambient
light. We successfully demonstrate that minor tilts and turns of mobile devices
cause variations of the ambient-light sensor information. Thus, we are the
first to show that this sensor leaks sensitive information. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that these variations leak enough information to infer a user's
personal identification number (PIN) input based on a set of known PINs. Our
results show that we are able to determine the correct PIN---out of a set of 50
random PINs---within the first ten guesses about 80% of the time. In contrast,
the chance of finding the right PIN by randomly guessing ten PINs would be 20%.
Since the data required to perform such an attack can be gathered without any
specific permissions or privileges, the presented side channel seriously
jeopardizes the security and privacy of mobile-device owners.

dependent diffusion constant which means that its average mean squared

microscopic diffusion constant, which is independent of the potential, to the
effective late time diffusion constant, a linear fit of the MSD will not in
general pass through the origin and will have a non-zero constant term. Here we
address how to compute the constant term and provide explicit results for
Brownian particles in one dimension in periodic potentials. We show that the
constant is always positive and that at low temperatures it depends on the
curvature of the minimum of the potential. For comparison we also consider the

Gray map from a subgroup of the direct product of Z2, Z4 and Q8 groups, where
Q8 is the quaternionic group. In a previous work, these kind of codes were
classified in five shapes. In this paper we analyze the allowable range of
values for the rank and dimension of the kernel, which depends on the
particular shape of the code. We show that all these codes can be represented
in a standard form, from a set of generators, which help to a well
understanding of the characteristics of each shape. The main results are the
characterization of Hadamard Z2Z4Q8-codes as a quotient of a semidirect product
of Z2Z4-linear codes and, on the other hand, the construction of Hadamard
Z2Z4Q8-codes code with any given pair of allowable parameters for the rank and

ability to respond to events and define complex events, with the execution of
transactions over general Knowledge Bases (KBs).
  With this as goal, we build on Transaction Logic (TR), a logic precisely
designed to model and execute transactions in KBs defined by arbitrary logic
theories. In it, transactions are written in a logic-programming style, by
combining primitive update operations over a general KB, with the usual logic
programming connectives and some additional connectives e.g. to express
sequence of actions. While TR is a natural choice to deal with transactions, it
remains the question whether TR can be used to express complex events, but also
to deal simultaneously with the detection of complex events and the execution
of transactions. In this paper we show that the former is possible while the
latter is not. For that, we start by illustrating how TR can express complex
events, and in particular, how SNOOP event expressions can be translated in the
logic. Afterwards, we show why TR fails to deal with the two issues together,
and to solve the intended problem propose Transaction Logic with Events, its
syntax, model theory and executional semantics. The achieved solution is a
non-monotonic extension of TR, which guarantees that every complex event
detected in a transaction is necessarily responded.

Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF), was used to map mid-infrared ammonia
absorption features on both Jupiter and Saturn in February 2013. Ammonia is the
principle reservoir of nitrogen on the giant planets, and the ratio of
isotopologues ($^{15}$N/$^{14}$N) can reveal insights into the molecular
carrier (e.g., as N$_2$ or NH$_3$) of nitrogen to the forming protoplanets, and
hence the source reservoirs from which these worlds accreted. We targeted two
spectral intervals (900 and 960 cm$^{-1}$) that were relatively clear of
terrestrial atmospheric contamination and contained close features of
$^{14}$NH$_3$ and $^{15}$NH$_3$, allowing us to derive the ratio from a single
spectrum without ambiguity due to radiometric calibration (the primary source
of uncertainty in this study). We present the first ground-based determination
of Jupiter's $^{15}$N/$^{14}$N ratio (in the range from $1.4\times10^{-3}$ to
$2.5\times10^{-3}$), which is consistent with both previous space-based studies
and with the primordial value of the protosolar nebula. On Saturn, we present
the first upper limit on the $^{15}$N/$^{14}$N ratio of no larger than
$2.0\times10^{-3}$ for the 900-cm$^{-1}$ channel and a less stringent
requirement that the ratio be no larger than $2.8\times10^{-3}$ for the
960-cm$^{-1}$ channel ($1\sigma$ confidence). Specifically, the data rule out
strong $^{15}$N-enrichments such as those observed in Titan's atmosphere and in
cometary nitrogen compounds. To the extent possible with ground-based
radiometric uncertainties, the saturnian and jovian $^{15}$N/$^{14}$N ratios
appear indistinguishable, implying that $^{15}$N-enriched ammonia ices could
not have been a substantial contributor to the bulk nitrogen inventory of
either planet, favouring the accretion of primordial N$_2$ from the gas phase
or as low-temperature ices.

phenomenological comorbidity network of human diseases that is based on medical
claims data of the entire population of Austria. The network is constructed
from a two-layer multiplex network, where in one layer the links represent the
conditional probability for a comorbidity, and in the other the links contain
the respective statistical significance. We show that the network undergoes
dramatic structural changes across the lifetime of patients.Disease networks
for children consist of a single, strongly inter-connected cluster. During
adolescence and adulthood further disease clusters emerge that are related to
specific classes of diseases, such as circulatory, mental, or genitourinary
disorders.For people above 65 these clusters start to merge and highly
connected hubs dominate the network. These hubs are related to hypertension,
chronic ischemic heart diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. We
introduce a simple diffusion model to understand the spreading of diseases on
the disease network at the population level. For the first time we are able to
show that patients predominantly develop diseases which are in close
network-proximity to disorders that they already suffer. The model explains
more than 85 % of the variance of all disease incidents in the population. The
presented methodology could be of importance for anticipating age-dependent
disease-profiles for entire populations, and for validation and of prevention
schemes.

well, which suggests that the source has at least two different accretion flow

In such a sample, the redshift dependence of a phenomenon could appear as a
luminosity-dependent effect and may not be really representing an intrinsic
property of the radio sample. We test this on the radio complete MRC (Molonglo

correlation tests show that the correlations are indeed stronger between the
redshift and the optical luminosity than that between the radio luminosity and
the optical luminosity, suggesting that the latter correlation perhaps arises
because of the Malmquist Bias. We further show that similar effects of the

inflation is driven by a slowly rolling inflaton field, called scalaron, and
followed by a coherently oscillating scalaron phase. Since the scalaron
oscillates excessively many times in its potential, which has a quadratic
minimum and is a little shallower than quadratic on the positive side, it may
fragment into long-living localized objects, called oscillons or I-balls, due
to nonlinear growth of fluctuations before reheating of the universe. We show
that while parametric self-resonances amplify scalaron fluctuations in the
Minkowski background, the growth cannot overcome the decay due to expansion in
the Friedmann background after $R^2$ inflation. By taking into account
back-reaction from the metric of spacetime, modes that are larger than a
critical scale are indeed amplified and become non-decaying. However, those
non-decaying modes are not growing enough to form spatially localized lumps of
the scalaron. Thus, reheating processes are unaltered by oscillons/I-balls and
they proceed through perturbative decay of the scalaron as studied in the
original work.

The high pressure annealed sample exhibits room temperature values of

thermal conductivity k around 1.5 W/Km, while the Hall resistance RH is
negative at all temperatures and its value is -10-8 m3/C at low temperature.
The sample prepared at ambient pressure exhibits RH positive in sign and five

high pressure annealing. In particular, the sign inversion and magnitude
suppression of RH, indicating increased electron-type carrier density in the

in lattice parameters and enhancement of superconducting Tc by high pressure
annealing. As for the undoped sample, it exhibits the 10 times larger

used to derive robust estimates of the disc mass. The median disc mass is
0.005$M_{\odot}$ for a sample of 28 Class IIs and 0.006$M_{\odot}$ for 6
transition disks (TDs). The fraction of objects in Chamaeleon-I with at least
the `minimum mass solar nebula' is 2-7%. This is consistent with previously
published results for Taurus, IC348, $\rho$ Oph. Diagrams of spectral slopes
show the effect of specific evolutionary processes in circumstellar discs.
Class II objects show a wide scatter that can be explained by dust settling. We
identify a continuous trend from Class II to TDs. Including Herschel fluxes in
this type of analysis highlights the diversity of TDs. We find that TDs are not
significantly different to Class II discs in terms of far-infrared luminosity,
disc mass or degree of dust settling. This indicates that inner dust clearing
occurs independently from other evolutionary processes in the discs.

derive RG-induced bounds, stronger than the direct constraints, on some Higgs

early evolution of brown dwarfs. Here we present IRTF/SpeX near-infrared
spectroscopy of 30 candidate members of the young Upper Scorpius association,
selected from our previous survey work. All 24 high confidence members are
confirmed as young very low mass objects with spectral types from M5 to L1,
15-20 of them are likely brown dwarfs. This high yield confirms that brown
dwarfs in Upper Scorpius can be identified from photometry and proper motions
alone, with negligible contamination from field objects (<4%). Out of the 6
candidates with lower confidence, 5 might still be young very low mass members
of Upper Scorpius, according to our spectroscopy. We demonstrate that some very
low mass class II objects exhibit radically different near infrared (0.6 -
2.5micron) spectra from class III objects, with strong excess emission
increasing towards longer wavelengths and partially filled in features at
wavelengths shorter than 1.25micron. These characteristics can obscure the
contribution of the photosphere within such spectra. Therefore, we caution that
near infrared derived spectral types for objects with discs may be unreliable.
Furthermore, we show that the same characteristics can be seen to some extent
in all class II and even a significant fraction of class III objects (~40%),
indicating that some of them are still surrounded by traces of dust and gas.
Based on our spectra, we select a sample of objects with spectral types of M5
to L1, whose near-infrared emission represents the photosphere only. We
recommend the use of these objects as spectroscopic templates for young brown
dwarfs in the future.

$\frac{1}{4}2^{2^n}$ for $n\geq 2$. We also construct examples of

one-to-one correspondence between vacillating Hecke tableaux and linked

theory. Motivated by the Hecke insertion algorithm, we define a Hecke diagram
as a Young diagram possibly with a marked corner. A vacillating Hecke tableau
is defined as a sequence of Hecke diagrams subject to certain addition and
deletion of rook strips. The notion of a rook strip was introduced by Buch in
the study of the Littlewood-Richardson rule for stable Grothendieck
polynomials. A rook strip is a skew Young diagram with at most one square in
each row and column. We show that the crossing number and the nesting number of
a linked partition can be determined by the maximal number of rows and the
maximal number of columns of the diagrams in the corresponding vacillating
Hecke tableau. The proof relies on a theorem due to Thomas and Yong concerning
the lengths of the longest strictly increasing and the longest strictly
decreasing subsequences in a word. This implies that the crossing number and
the nesting number have a symmetric joint distribution over linked partitions,
confirming a conjecture of de Mier. We also prove a conjecture of Kim which
states that the crossing number and the nesting number have a symmetric joint
distribution over the front representations of partitions.

also corresponding contributions from Z boson are present that are usually
neglected. We calculate the impact of these contributions on Delta F=2
processes and rare K, B_s and B_d decays for different values of a parameter
beta, which distinguishes between various 331 models and for different fermion
representations under the SU(3)_L group. We find a general expression for the
Z-Z' mixing in terms beta, M_Z, M_Z' and tan(bar{beta}), familiar from 2 Higgs
Doublet models, that differs from the one quoted in the literature. We study in
particular the models with beta=+-n/sqrt{3} with n=1,2 which have recently been
investigated by us in the context of new data on B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^- and
B_d->K^*(K)mu^+ mu^-. We find that these new contributions can indeed be
neglected in the case of Delta F=2 transitions and decays, like
B_d->K^*mu^+mu^-, where they are suppressed by the small vectorial Z coupling
to charged leptons. However the contributions of tree-level Z exchanges to
decays sensitive to axial-vector couplings, like B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^- and B_d->K
mu^+ mu^-, and those with neutrinos in the final state, like b->s nu bar{nu}
transitions, K^+->pi^+ nu bar{nu} and K_L->pi^0 nu bar{nu} cannot be generally
neglected with size of Z contributions depending on beta, tan(bar{beta}) and
M_Z'. We analyze for the first time the ratio epsilon'/epsilon in these models
including both Z' and Z contributions. Our analysis of electroweak precision
observables within 331 models demonstrates transparently that the interplay of
NP effects in electroweak precision observables and those in flavour
observables could allow in the future to identify the favourite 331 model.

elucidated. In this study, we focussed on the hierarchical structure of the TRN
of the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and performed a comparative
analysis with the TRN of the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. Using a
graph-theoretic approach, we organized the transcription factors (TFs) and
sigma-factors in the TRNs of B. subtilis and E. coli into three hierarchical
levels (Top, Middle and Bottom) and studied several structural and functional
properties across them. In addition to many similarities, we found also
specific differences, explaining the majority of them with variations in the
distribution of sigma-factors across the hierarchical levels in the two
organisms. We then investigated the control of target metabolic genes by
transcriptional regulators to characterize the differential regulation of three
distinct metabolic subsystems (catabolism, anabolism and central energy
metabolism). These results suggest that the hierarchical architecture that we
observed in B. subtilis represents an effective organization of its TRN to
achieve flexibility in the response to diverse stimuli.

Analysis of all observed maxima allows us to identify two primary pulsation
states defined as pulsation over a long (P0 longer than 0.56684 d) and a short
(P0 shorter than 0.56682 d) primary pulsation period. These states alternate
with intervals of 13-16 yr, and are well defined after 1943. The 40.8 d
periodical modulations of the amplitude and the period (i.e. Blazhko effect)
were noticed in 1916. We provide homogeneous determinations of the Blazhko
period in the different primary pulsation states. The Blazhko period does not
follow the variations of P0 and suddenly diminished from 40.8 d to around 39.0
d in 1975. The monitoring of these periodicities deserved and deserves a
continuous and intensive observational effort. For this purpose we have built
dedicated, transportable and autonomous small instruments, Very Tiny Telescopes

considered on a space of weighted H\""older continuous functions. The measure is
supported on this space and the NLW is locally well-posed there, a
counter-point to the Sobolev super-criticality noted by Burq and Tzvetkov.
Furthermore, the flow of the NLW leaves this measure invariant. We use a
multi-time Feynman--Kac formula to construct the infinite volume limit measure
by computing the asymptotics of the fundamental solution of an appropriate
parabolic PDE. We use finite speed of propagation and results from descriptive
set theory to establish invariance of the infinite volume measure. To the best

coupled medium. The basis of this phenomenological approach is to treat physics
processes at different energy scales differently. The high-$Q^2$ processes
associated with the QCD evolution of the jet from production as a single hard
parton through its fragmentation, up to but not including hadronization, are
treated perturbatively. The interactions between the partons in the shower and
the deconfined matter within which they find themselves lead to energy loss.
The momentum scales associated with the medium (of the order of the
temperature) and with typical interactions between partons in the shower and
the medium are sufficiently soft that strongly coupled physics plays an
important role in energy loss. We model these interactions using qualitative
insights from holographic calculations of the energy loss of energetic light
quarks and gluons in a strongly coupled plasma, obtained via gauge/gravity
duality. We embed this hybrid model into a hydrodynamic description of the
spacetime evolution of the hot QCD matter produced in heavy ion collisions and
confront its predictions with jet data from the LHC. The holographic expression
for the energy loss of a light quark or gluon that we incorporate in our hybrid
model is parametrized by a stopping distance. We find very good agreement with
all the data as long as we choose a stopping distance that is comparable to but
somewhat longer than that in ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. For
comparison, we also construct alternative models in which energy loss occurs as
it would if the plasma were weakly coupled. We close with suggestions of
observables that could provide more incisive evidence for, or against, the
importance of strongly coupled physics in jet quenching.

is still open and in fact, has been mentioned as a key research challenge. In
this paper, we settle this open question for many common voting rules.
  We show that the Possible Winner problem for maximin, Copeland, Bucklin,
ranked pairs, and a class of scoring rules that include the Borda voting rule
do not admit a polynomial kernel with the number of candidates as the

an important special case of the Possible Winner problem does admit a
polynomial kernel for maximin, Copeland, ranked pairs, and a class of scoring

polynomial in the number of candidates. A significant conclusion of our work is
that the Possible Winner problem is harder than the Coalitional Manipulation
problem since the Coalitional Manipulation problem admits a polynomial kernel
whereas the Possible Winner problem does not admit a polynomial kernel.

investigate the use of a combination of off-the-shelf techniques from the

be solved using a combination of tools based on well-known techniques from
abstract interpretation, semantics-preserving transformations, program

design of automatic, more general CHC verification tools based on a library of

Materials with negative refractive index have been shown to enable the
generation of an enhanced resolution image where both propagating and
non-propagating waves are employed. We analyze such a Veselago lens by
exploiting some exact one dimensional integral expressions for the quasi-static
electric potential of a point charge in that system. Those were recently
obtained by expanding that potential in the quasi-static eigenfunctions of a
three-flat-slabs composite structure. Numerical evaluations of those integrals,
using realistic values for physical parameters like the electric permittivities
of the constituent slabs and their thickness, reveal some surprising effects:
E.g., the maximum concentration of the electric field occurs not at the
geometric optics foci but at the interfaces between the negative permittivity
slab and the positive permittivity slabs. The analysis provides simple
computational guides for designing such structures in order to achieve enhanced
resolution of an optical image.

inverse femtobarns. The search is performed using a selection of events
containing leptons and bottom-quark jets. No evidence for a significant excess
of events over the standard model background prediction is observed. The
results are interpreted in the context of simplified supersymmetric models with
pair production of a heavier top-squark mass eigenstate stop[2] decaying to a
lighter top-squark mass eigenstate stop[1] via either stop[2] to H stop[1] or
stop[2] to Z stop[1], followed in both cases by stop[1] to t neutralino, where
neutralino is an undetected, stable, lightest supersymmetric particle. The
interpretation is performed in the region where the mass difference between the
stop[1] and neutralino states is approximately equal to the top-quark mass
(m[stop[1]] - m[neutralino] ~= m[t]), which is not probed by searches for
direct stop[1] squark pair production. The analysis excludes top squarks with
masses m[stop[2]] < 575 GeV and m[stop[1]] < 400 GeV at a 95% confidence level.

imaging system incorporating mechanical vibrations simultaneously applied to an

conductivity distribution by applying time-harmonic mechanical vibrations on
the boundary. This enhances the effects of any conductivity discontinuity on
the induced internal current density distribution. Unlike other conductivity
contrast enhancing frameworks, it does not require a prior knowledge of a
reference data. In this paper, we provide a mathematical framework for this
novel imaging modality. As an application of the vibration-assisted impedance
imaging framework, we propose a new breast image reconstruction method in
electrical impedance tomography (EIT). As its another application, we
investigate a conductivity anomaly detection problem and provide an efficient
location search algorithm. We show both analytically and numerically that the
applied mechanical vibration increases the data sensitivity to the conductivity
contrast and enhances the quality of reconstructed images and anomaly detection
results. For numerous applications in impedance imaging, the proposed
multi-physics method opens a new difference imaging area called the
vibration-difference imaging, which can augment the time-difference and also
frequency-difference imaging methods for sensitivity improvements.
