frequency band and are orthogonal to each other for every subcarrier in the
discrete frequency domain. The orthogonality is not affected by time delays
from transmitters. Thus, our proposed MIMO OFDM radar has the same range
resolution as single transmitter radar and achieves full spatial diversity.
Orthogonal designs are used to achieve this orthogonality across the
transmitters, with which it is only needed to design OFDM pulses for the first
transmitter. We also propose a joint pulse compression and pulse coherent
integration for range reconstruction. In order to achieve the optimal SNR for
the range reconstruction, we apply the paraunitary filterbank theory to design
the OFDM pulses. We then propose a modified iterative clipping and filtering
(MICF) algorithm for the designs of OFDM pulses jointly, when other important
factors, such as peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in time domain, are also
considered. With our proposed MIMO OFDM radar, there is no interference for the
range reconstruction not only across the transmitters but also across the range
cells in a swath called inter-range-cell interference (IRCI) free that is
similar to our previously proposed CP based OFDM radar for single transmitter.
Simulations are presented to illustrate our proposed theory and show that the

intensities measured toward the Orion Bar CO$^+$ Peak and Herschel/HIFI maps of
C$_2$H, CH, and HCO$^+$, and a NANTEN map of [CI]. We interpret the observed
C$_2$H emission using radiative transfer and PDR models. Five rotational
transitions of C$_2$H have been detected in the HIFI frequency range toward the
CO$^+$ peak. A single component rotational diagram gives a rotation temperature
of ~64 K and a beam-averaged C$_2$H column density of 4$\times$10$^{13}$
cm$^{-2}$. The measured transitions cannot be explained by any single parameter
model. According to a non-LTE model, most of the C$_2$H column density produces
the lower-$N$ C$_2$H transitions and traces a warm ($T_{\rm{kin}}$ ~ 100-150 K)
and dense ($n$(H$_2$)~10$^5$-10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$) gas. A small fraction of the
C$_2$H column density is required to reproduce the intensity of the highest-$N$
transitions ($N$=9-8 and N=10-9) originating from a high density
($n$(H$_2$)~5$\times$10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$) hot ($T_{\rm{kin}}$ ~ 400 K) gas. The
total beam-averaged C$_2$H column density in the model is 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$.
Both the non-LTE radiative transfer model and a simple PDR model representing
the Orion Bar with a plane-parallel slab of gas and dust suggest, that C$_2$H
cannot be described by a single pressure component, unlike the reactive ion
CH$^+$, which was previously analysed toward the Orion Bar CO$^+$ peak. The
physical parameters traced by the higher rotational transitions
($N$=6-5,...,10-9) of C$_2$H may be consistent with the edges of dense clumps
exposed to UV radiation near the ionization front of the Orion Bar.

using extreme value distributions, with extremal dependence across time
accomplished through an extreme value Markov model. One important virtue of
interpretability is that model parameters directly translate into quantities of

It is expected that the Dirac equation holds for microscopic masses, and the
Kerr solution for macroscopic masses. This suggests that Einstein gravity and
the Dirac theory are limiting cases of a common underlying theoretical

Bright points (BPs) are small-scale, magnetic features ubiquitous
across the solar surface. Previously, we have observed and noted their
properties for quiet Sun regions. Here, we determine the dynamic properties of
BPs using simultaneous quiet Sun and active region data. Methods. High spatial
and temporal resolution G-band observations of active region AR11372 were
obtained with the Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere instrument at the
Dunn Solar Telescope. Three subfields of varying polarity and magnetic flux
density were selected with the aid of magnetograms obtained from the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory.
Bright points within these subfields were subsequently tracked and analysed.
Results. It is found that BPs within active regions display attenuated velocity
distributions with an average horizontal velocity of ~0.6 km/s, compared to the
quiet region which had an average velocity of 0.9 km/s. Active region BPs are
also ~21% larger than quiet region BPs and have longer average lifetimes
(~132s) than their quiet region counterparts (88 s). No preferential flow
directions are observed within the active region subfields. The diffusion index
(gamma) is estimated at ~1.2 for the three regions. Conclusions. We confirm
that the dynamic properties of BPs arise predominately from convective motions.
The presence of stronger field strengths within active regions is the likely
reason behind the varying properties observed. We believe that larger amounts
of magnetic flux will attenuate BP velocities by a combination of restricting
motion within the intergranular lanes and by increasing the number of
stagnation points produced by inhibited convection. Larger BPs are found in
regions of higher magnetic flux density and we believe that lifetimes increase
in active regions as the magnetic flux stabilises the BPs.

mean magnetic field that exhibits irregular cyclic behavior with oscillation
time scales ranging from about 5 to 15 years and undergoes irregular polarity
reversals. The mean axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field is of opposite signs
in the two hemispheres and is concentrated at the bottom of the convection
zone. The presence of the magnetic fields is found to play an important role in
the self-consistent maintenance of a solar-like differential rotation in the
convective dynamo model. Without the magnetic fields, the convective flows
drive a differential rotation with a faster rotating polar region. In the midst
of magneto-convection, we found emergence of strong super-equipartition flux

The fact that the global modes of a NS two form in an open string theory
sources the background metric on a $D_4$-brane may hint at the existence of an
anti $D_4$-brane in the formalism. An effective de Sitter universe is shown to
emerge on a vacuum created pair of $(D{\bar D})_3$-brane by a local two form at
the past horizon with a Big Bang. We obtain a number of 4D de Sitter quantum
black holes, including a Reissner-Nordstrom vacuum, with and without a
propagating torsion. The quantum black holes are shown to be free from
curvature singularity at $r\rightarrow 0$. In a low energy limit, the
nonperturbative correction sourced by a torison may seen to be insignificant.
The quantum black hole undergoes an expansion in the limit and presumably
identifies with the Einstein vacuum. Interestingly our analysis reveals a
plausible quintessence (axion) on an anti $D_3$-brane which may source the dark
energy in a $D_3$-brane universe. Arguably a brane universe moves away from its
anti-brane due to the conjectured repulsive gravity underlying the
quintessence. It leads to a growth in extra fifth dimension between a brane and

cosmic rays (UHECR) (E > $10^{18}$ eV) are determined for five individual
sources. The upper limit on the integral flux of GeV-TeV gamma-rays of a given
source is used to extract the upper limit on the total UHECR luminosity. The
correlation between upper limit on the integral GeVTeV gamma-ray flux and upper
limit on the UHECR luminosity is established through the cascading process that
takes place during propagation of the cosmic rays in the background radiation
fields, as explained in reference [1]. Twenty-eight sources measured by
FERMI-LAT, VERITAS and MAGIC observatories have been studied. The measured
upper limit on the GeV-TeV gamma-ray flux is restrictive enough to allow the
calculation of an upper limit on the total UHECR cosmic-ray luminosity of five
sources. The upper limit on the UHECR cosmicray luminosity of these sources is
shown for several assumptions on the emission mechanism. For all studied
sources an upper limit on the ultra-high-energy proton luminosity is also set.

direct photon yield from Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV down
to $p_T=0.4$ GeV/$c$. Photons are detected via photon conversions to $e^+e^-$
pairs and an improved technique is applied that minimizes the systematic
uncertainties that usually limit direct photon measurements, in particular at
low $p_T$. We find an excess of direct photons above the $N_{\rm coll}$-scaled
yield measured in $p$$+$$p$ collisions. This excess yield is well described by
an exponential distribution with an inverse slope of about 240 MeV/$c$ in the
$p_T$ range from 0.6--2.0 GeV/$c$. While the shape of the $p_T$ distribution is
independent of centrality within the experimental uncertainties, the yield
increases rapidly with increasing centrality, scaling approximately with
$N_{\rm part}^\alpha$, where $\alpha=1.48{\pm}0.08({\rm stat}){\pm}0.04({\rm

the fact that the entire network infrastructure, including the battery operated
ground terminals, exhibits requirements to operate under power-constrained
situations. In this paper, we discuss the design and evaluation of an adaptive
cooperative scheme intended to extend the survivability of the battery operated
aerial-terrestrial communication links. We propose and evaluate a real-time
adaptive cooperative transmission strategy for dynamic selection between direct
and cooperative links based on the channel conditions for improved energy
efficiency. We show that the cooperation between mobile terrestrial terminals
on the ground could improve the energy efficiency in the uplink depending on
the temporal behavior of the terrestrial and the aerial uplink channels. The
corresponding delay in having cooperative (relay-based) communications with
relay selection is also addressed. The simulation analysis corroborates that
the adaptive transmission technique improves the overall energy efficiency of
the network whilst maintaining low latency enabling real time applications.

weak vector bosons is an important goal of an $e^+e^-$ collider commissioned as
a Higgs factory. We perform a detailed analysis of such potential of a collider
operating at $250 - 300$ GeV. Mostly using higher dimensional operators in a
gauge-invariant framework, we show that substantial information on anomalous
couplings can be extracted from the total rates of $s$-and $t$-channel Higgs
production. The most obvious kinematic distributions, based on angular
dependence of matrix elements, are relatively less sensitive with moderate
coefficients of anomalous couplings, unless one goes to higher centre-of-mass
energies. Some important quantities to use here, apart from the total event
rates, are the ratios of event rates at different energies, ratios of $s$ and
$t$-channel rates at fixed energies, and under some fortunate circumstances,
the correlated changes in the rates for $W$-boson pair-production. A general
scheme of calculating rates with as many as four gauge-invariant operators is
also outlined. At the end, we perform a likelihood analysis using
phenomenological parametrization of anomalous $HWW$ interaction, and indicate
their distinguishability for illustrative values of the strength of such
interactions.

production, is a common motif in gene expression networks. Negative feedback in
gene expression plays a critical role in buffering intracellular fluctuations
in protein concentrations around optimal value. Due to the nonlinearities
present in these feedbacks, moment dynamics are typically not closed, in the
sense that the time derivative of the lower-order statistical moments of the
protein copy number depends on high-order moments. Moment equations are closed
by expressing higher-order moments as nonlinear functions of lower-order
moments, a technique commonly referred to as moment closure. Here, we compare
the performance of different moment closure techniques. Our results show that
the commonly used closure method, which assumes a priori that the protein
population counts are normally distributed, performs poorly. In contrast,
conditional derivative matching, a novel closure scheme proposed here provides
a good approximation to the exact moments across different parameter regimes.
In summary our study provides a new moment closure method for studying
stochastic dynamics of genetic negative feedback circuits, and can be extended
to probe noise in more complex gene networks.

the shift-symmetry, the leading contribu- tion to the inflaton potential is
free from the dangerous exponential factor even after its breaking, which is
the main obstacle to realizing the super-Planckian inflation in supergravity.

which is the magnitude gap between the two most luminous galaxies in the group.
Studies of these types of groups in the millennium cosmological simulations
show that, although they have accumulated a significant fraction of their mass,
relatively earlier than groups with a small luminosity gap, this parameter
alone is not highly efficient in fully discriminating between the ""old"" and

contaminated sample of old galaxy groups. By adding constraints on the
luminosity of the brightest galaxy, and its offset from the group luminosity

orders of magnitude as the ratio of the drive frequency $\omega$ and amplitude
$h_{0}$ tends to certain specific values (the freezing condition). If $\omega$

high-multiplicity p-Pb events can be well described in hydrodynamics,
suggesting that collective flow is plausible as a correct description of these
collisions. However, a more stringent test of the presence of hydrodynamic
behavior can be made by studying the detailed momentum dependence of
two-particle correlations. We define a relevant observable, $r_n$, and make
predictions for its value and centrality dependence if hydrodynamics is a valid
description. This will provide a non-trivial confirmation of the nature of the
correlations seen in small collision systems, and potentially to determine
where the hydrodynamic description, if valid anywhere, stops being valid.
Lastly, we probe what can be learned from this observable, finding that it is
insensitive to viscosity, but sensitive to aspects of the initial state of the
system that other observables are insensitive to, such as the transverse length
scale of the fluctuations in the initial stages of the collision.

distortion tradeoffs for Gaussian bandlimited periodic signals with additive
white Gaussian noise are studied. Our emphasis is on characterizing the optimal
sampling locations as well as the optimal pre-sampling filter to minimize the
reconstruction distortion. We first show that to achieve the optimal
distortion, no pre-sampling filter is necessary for any arbitrary sampling
rate. Then, we provide a complete characterization of optimal distortion for
low and high sampling rates (with respect to the signal bandwidth). We also
provide bounds on the reconstruction distortion for rates in the intermediate
region. It is shown that nonuniform sampling outperforms uniform sampling for
low sampling rates. In addition, the optimal nonuniform sampling set is robust
with respect to missing sampling values. On the other hand, for the sampling
rates above the Nyquist rate, the uniform sampling strategy is optimal. An
extension of the results for random discrete periodic signals is discussed with
simulation results indicating that the intuitions from the continuous domain
carry over to the discrete domain. Sparse signals are also considered, where it
is shown that uniform sampling is optimal above the Nyquist rate.

preceding the main event, whose spectral and temporal properties are similar to
the main emission. We propose that precursors have their own fireball,
producing afterglow emission due to the dissipation of the kinetic energy via
external shock. In the time lapse between the precursor and the main event, we
assume that the central engine is not completely turned off, but it continues
to eject relativistic material at a smaller rate, whose emission is below the
background level. The precursor fireball generates a first afterglow by the
interaction with the external circumburst medium. Matter injected by the
central engine during the ""quasi-quiescent"" phase replenishes the external
medium with material in relativistic motion. The fireball corresponding to the
main prompt emission episode crashes with this moving material, producing a
second afterglow, and finally catches up and merges with the first precursor
fireball. We apply this new model to GRB 091024, an event with a precursor in
the prompt light curve and two well defined bumps in the optical afterglow,
obtaining an excellent agreement with the existing data.

running of the spectral index. Here we show that the preferred level of running
alleviates small-scale issues within the $\Lambda$CDM model, more so even than
viable WDM models. We use cosmological zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-size
halo along with full-box simulations to compare predictions among four separate
cosmologies: a BICEP2-inspired running index model ($\alpha_s$ = -0.024), two
fixed-tilt $\Lambda$CDM models motivated by Planck, and a 2.6 keV thermal WDM
model. We find that the running BICEP2 model reduces the central densities of
large dwarf-size halos ($V_\mathrm{max}$ ~ 30 - 80 km s$^{-1}$) and alleviates
the too-big-to-fail problem significantly compared to our adopted Planck and
WDM cases. Further, the BICEP2 model suppresses the count of small subhalos by
~50% relative to Planck models, and yields a significantly lower ""boost"" factor

transfers from distant sources must be important, not least because the flow at
the disk midplane in the bulk of the disk is likely outwards, out of the
gravitational potential well. If the source of the viscosity is powered by
accretion, such as in the case of the magneto-rotational instability, such
distant energy sources must lie in the innermost regions of the disk, where
accretion occurs even at the midplane. We argue here that modulations in this
energy supply can alter the accretion rate on dynamical, rather than far longer
viscous, time scales. This means that both the steady state value of and
fluctuations in the inner disk's accretion rate, depending on the details of
the inner boundary condition and occurring on the inner disk's rapid evolution
time, can affect the outer disk. This is particularly interesting because
observations have shown that disk accretion is not steady (e.g.~EX Lupi type
objects). We also note that the power supplied to shearing boxes is set by the
boxes themselves rather than the physical energy fluxes in a global disk. That
is, their saturated magnetic field is not subject to the full set of energy
constraints present in an actual disk. Our analysis suggests that large scale
radial transport of energy has a critical impact on the evolution and
variability of accretion disks.

Our preferred models produce populations of DLAs in good agreement with most of
these observations. The exception is the DLA abundance at $z < 3$, which we
show requires stronger feedback in $10^{11-12} \, h^{-1} M_\odot$ mass halos.
While the DLA population probes a wide range of halo masses, we find the
cross-section is dominated by halos of mass $10^{10} - 10^{11} \, h^{-1}
M_\odot$ and virial velocities $50 - 100 \;\mathrm{km/s}$. The simulated DLA
population has a linear theory bias of $1.7$, whereas the observations require
$2.17 \pm 0.2$. We show that non-linear growth increases the bias in our
simulations to $2.3$ at $k=1\; \mathrm{Mpc/}h$, the smallest scale observed.
The scale-dependence of the bias is, however, very different in the simulations
compared against the observations. We show that, of the observations we

differential geometry and theoretical physics is dealt with in this short work:
Is there any criterion in order to decide whether a pseudo-Riemannian space can
be locally described using curvature scalars solely? Surprisingly enough, this
question is susceptible of a very simple and elegant answer. In order to avoid
unnecessary complexity, the analysis is restricted to local rather than global
considerations, without any loss of not only the generality but also the
insights to the initial problem.

highest permeability is found within sets of cross-strata of open-framework
conglomerate (OFC). They are preserved within unit bar deposits and assemblages
of unit bar deposits within compound (braid) bar deposits. They are thief zones
limiting enhanced oil recovery. We incorporate recent research that has
quantified important attributes of their sedimentary architecture within
preserved deposits. We use high-resolution models to demonstrate the
fundamental aspects of their control on oil production rate, water breakthrough
time, and spatial and temporal distribution of residual oil saturation. We
found that when the pressure gradient is oriented perpendicular to the
paleoflow direction, the total oil production and the water breakthrough time
are larger, and remaining oil saturation is smaller, than when it is oriented
parallel to paleoflow. The pressure difference between production and injection
wells does not affect sweep efficiency, although the spatial distribution of
oil remaining in the reservoir critically depends on this value. Oil sweep
efficiency decreases slightly with increase in the proportion of OFC
cross-strata. Whether or not clusters of connected OFC span the domain does not
visibly affect sweep efficiency.

emission of double photons and linear attenuation, while the second one is
motivated by heralded sources utilizing spontaneous parametric down-conversion.
We find conditions for the photon statistics that guarantee generation of
entanglement in the relevant qubit subspaces and compare it with classicality
criteria. We also quantify the amount of entanglement that can be produced with
imperfect single-photon sources, optimized over setup parameters, using as a
measure entanglement of formation. Finally, we discuss verification of the
generated entanglement by testing Bell's inequalities. The analysis is carried
out for two schemes. The first one is the well-established one-photon scheme,
which produces a photon in a delocalized superposition state between two nodes,
each of them fed with one single photon at the input. As the second scheme, we
introduce and analyze a linear-optics analog of the robust scheme based on
interfering two Stokes photons emitted by atomic ensembles, which does not
require phase stability between the nodes.

between them via dipole coupling and Bennett clocking, is a potential
replacement for conventional transistor logic since magnets dissipate less
energy than transistors when they switch in response to the clock. However,
dipole-coupled NML is much more error-prone than transistor logic because
thermal noise can easily disrupt magnetization dynamics. Here, we study a
particularly energy-efficient version of dipole-coupled NML known as
straintronic multiferroic logic (SML) where magnets are clocked/switched with
electrically generated mechanical strain. By appropriately shaping the voltage
pulse that generates strain, the error rate in SML can be reduced to tolerable
limits. In this paper, we describe the error probabilities associated with
various stress pulse shapes and discuss the trade-off between error rate and

rate can be described by a temperature dependent power-law $\omega^{n(T)}$

domain. The reasoning by means of p-box cdf-intervals is an interval
computation which is exerted on the real domain then it is projected onto the

of their Balmer emission lines we obtained ionised gas velocity dispersion from
high S/N high-dispersion spectroscopy (Subaru-HDS and ESO VLT-UVES) and
integrated H$\beta$ fluxes from low dispersion wide aperture spectrophotometry.
We find that the $L - \sigma$ relation is strong and stable against
restrictions in the sample (mostly based on the emission line profiles). The
`gaussianity' of the profile is important for reducing the rms uncertainty of
the distance indicator, but at the expense of substantially reducing the
sample. By fitting other physical parameters into the correlation we are able
to significantly decrease the scatter without reducing the sample. The size of
the starforming region is an important second parameter, while adding the
emission line equivalent width or the continuum colour and metallicity,
produces the solution with the smallest rms scatter=$\delta \log
L(\mathrm{H}\beta) = 0.233$. The derived coefficients in the best $L - \sigma$
relation are very close to what is expected from virialized ionising clusters,
while the derived sum of the stellar and ionised gas masses are similar to the
dynamical mass estimated using the HST corrected Petrosian radius. These
results are compatible with gravity being the main mechanism causing the
broadening of the emission lines in these very young and massive clusters. The
derived masses range from about 2 $\times10^6$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to $10^9$
$\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and their `corrected' Petrosian radius, from a few tens to
a few hundred parsecs.

models to solving this problem that ignore the role of users in the system. In
this paper, we propose to overcome this limitation by incorporating a
user-centric design of visual fashion recommendations. Specifically, we propose
a technique that augments 'user preferences' in models by exploiting elasticity
in fashion choices. We further design a user study on these choices and gather
results from the 'wisdom of crowd' for deeper analysis. Our key insights learnt
through these results suggest that fashion preferences when constrained to a
particular class, contain important behavioral signals that are often ignored
in recommendation design. Further, presence of such classes also reflect strong
correlations to visual perception which can be utilized to provide
aesthetically pleasing user experiences. Finally, we illustrate that user
approval of visual fashion recommendations can be substantially improved by
carefully incorporating these user-centric feedback into the system framework.

depends on knowing whether the properties of small dark matter structures at

counterparts. To clarify this point, we performed a high-resolution N-body
simulation of a cosmological volume 1 Mpc/h comoving on a side, reaching the
highest mass resolution to date in this regime. We make precision measurements
of various physical properties that characterize dark matter haloes (such as
the virial ratio, spin parameter, shape, and formation times, etc.) for the
high-redshift (z > 15) dark matter mini-haloes we find in our simulation, and
compare them to literature results and a moderate-resolution comparison run
within a cube of side-length 100 Mpc/h. We find that dark matter haloes at
high-redshift have a log-normal distribution of the dimensionless spin
parameter centered around {\lambda} $\sim$ 0.03, similar to their more massive
counterparts. They tend to have a small ratio of the length of the shortest
axis to the longest axis (sphericity), and are highly prolate. In fact, haloes
of given mass that formed recently are the least spherical, have the highest
virial ratios, and have the highest spins. Interestingly, the formation times
of our mini-halos depend only very weakly on mass, in contrast to more massive
objects. This is expected from the slope of the linear power spectrum of
density perturbations at this scale, but despite this difference, dark matter
structures at high-redshift share many properties with their much more massive
counterparts observed at later times.

$k=n/2-1$, the extremal examples are completely characterized. For all other
values of $k$, the structure of the extremal examples is far from known: their
total number is unknown, and only a few classes of examples were presented,
that are almost symmetric, consisting roughly of the $kn$ ""longest possible""
edges of $CK(n)$, the complete CGG of order $n$.
  In order to understand further the structure of the extremal examples, we
present a class of extremal examples that lie at the other end of the spectrum.
Namely, we break the symmetry by requiring that, in addition, the graph admit
an independent set that consists of $q$ consecutive vertices on the boundary of
the convex hull. We show that such graphs exist as long as $q \leq n-2k$ and
that this value of $q$ is optimal.
  We generalize our discussion to the following question: what is the maximal
possible number $f(n,k,q)$ of edges in a CGG on $n$ vertices that does not
contain $k+1$ pairwise disjoint edges, and, in addition, admits an independent
set that consists of $q$ consecutive vertices on the boundary of the convex

$D(n,\text{Prob}(\text{arc})=p)$ and $D(n,\text{number of arcs}=m)$ are
studied. In 1990, Karp for $D(n,p)$ and independently T. \L uczak for
$D(n,m=cn)$ proved that for $c>1$, with probability tending to 1, there is an
unique strong component of size of order $n$. Karp showed, in fact, that the
giant component has likely size asymptotic to $n\theta^2$, where
$\theta=\theta(c)$ is the unique positive root of $1-\theta=e^{-c \theta}$. In
this paper we prove that, for both random digraphs, the joint distribution of
the number of vertices and number of arcs in the giant strong component is
asymptotically Gaussian with the same mean vector $n\boldsymbol{\mu}(c)$,
$\boldsymbol{\mu}(c):=(\theta^2, c\theta^2)$ and two distinct $2\times 2$
covariance matrices, $n\mathbf{B}(c)$ and $n[\mathbf{B}(c)+c
(\boldsymbol{\mu}'(c))^T (\boldsymbol{\mu}'(c)))]$. To this end, we introduce
and analyze a randomized deletion process which determines the directed
$(1,1)$-core, the maximal digraph with minimum in-degree and out-degree at
least 1. This $(1,1)$-core contains all non-trivial strong components. However,
we show that the likely numbers of peripheral vertices and arcs in the
$(1,1)$-core, those outside the largest strong component, are of log-polynomial
order, thus dwarfed by anticipated fluctuations, on the scale of $n^{1/2}$, of
the giant component parameters. By approximating the likely realization of the
deletion algorithm with a deterministic trajectory, we obtain our main result
via exponential supermartingales and Fourier-based techniques.

equivalent widths of their CO 2.29um features allow us to determine their
spectral types and hence derive extinction along the line of sight, distance,
and physical size of the shells. We also find twelve early type stars, in nine
MBs and the 3 comparison objects. We find that the subtype inferred from the

eigenvalues of non-normal matrices in terms of the norm of their difference. We
introduce and estimate a hyperbolic metric analogue of the classical

characterization of the localization of eigenvalues. Our bound improves on the
best classical spectral-variation bounds due to Krause if the distance of
matrices is sufficiently small and is sharp for asymptotically large matrices.
Our approach is based on the theory of model operators, which provides us with
strong resolvent estimates. The latter naturally lead to a Chebychev-type
interpolation problem with finite Blaschke products, which can be solved
explicitly and gives stronger bounds than the classical Chebychev interpolation
with polynomials. As compared to the classical approach our method does not
rely on Hadamard's inequality and immediately generalize to algebraic operators

null (ghost) state at (below) the perturbative Higuchi bound are mere artifacts
of not only linearization but also assuming the Fierz-Pauli mass term. We point
out that, besides de Sitter, there are vacuum solutions where the space
asymptotically is de Sitter both in the past and in the future, the space first
contracts, this contraction slows down, and then reverses into expansion, so
there is an epoch where the space appears to be (nearly) flat, even though the
vacuum energy density is non-vanishing. We confirm this by constructing a
closed-form exact solution to full non-perturbative equations of motion for a
""special"" massive de Sitter case. We give a formula for the ""critical"" mass
above which such solutions apparently do not exist. For the Fierz-Pauli mass
term this ""critical"" mass coincides with the perturbative Higuchi bound, and
the former serves as the non-perturbative reinterpretation of the latter. We
argue that, notwithstanding the perturbative ghost, non-perturbatively there is
no ""instability"". Instead, there are additional vacuum solutions that may have
interesting cosmological implications, which we briefly speculate on.

vulnerable to noise. As an established tool to subdue noise, quantum error
correction is unfortunately overprotective because the quantum enhancement can
still be achieved even if the states are irrecoverably affected, provided that
the quantum Fisher information, which sets the ultimate limit to the precision
of metrological schemes, is preserved and attained. Here, we develop a theory
of robust metrological schemes that preserve the quantum Fisher information
instead of the quantum states themselves against noise. After deriving a
minimal set of testable conditions on this kind of robustness, we construct a
family of $2t+1$ qubits metrological schemes being immune to $t$-qubit errors
after the signal sensing. In comparison at least five qubits are required for
correcting arbitrary 1-qubit errors in standard quantum error correction.

features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and
they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, ""powerful,"" ""strong"" and
""Paris"" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an
unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from
variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents.
Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to
predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the
potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results
show that Paragraph Vectors outperform bag-of-words models as well as other
techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art

using these sub codebooks, and the distance between two data points can be
approximated efficiently from their codes by the precomputed lookup tables.
Traditionally, to encode a subvector of a data point in a subspace, only one
sub codeword in the corresponding sub codebook is selected, which may impose
strict restrictions on the search accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach, named Optimized Cartesian $K$-Means (OCKM), to better encode the data
points for more accurate approximate nearest neighbor search. In OCKM, multiple
sub codewords are used to encode the subvector of a data point in a subspace.
Each sub codeword stems from different sub codebooks in each subspace, which
are optimally generated with regards to the minimization of the distortion
errors. The high-dimensional data point is then encoded as the concatenation of
the indices of multiple sub codewords from all the subspaces. This can provide
more flexibility and lower distortion errors than traditional methods.
Experimental results on the standard real-life datasets demonstrate the
superiority over state-of-the-art approaches for approximate nearest neighbor

thermodynamic imperative of increasing the entropy production of the biosphere

atmosphere of today, oxygen and ozone derived from life processes are
performing the short wavelength UVC and UVB dissipation. On Earth's surface,
water and organic pigments in water facilitate the near UV and visible photon
dissipation. The first organic pigments probably formed, absorbed, and
dissipated at those photochemically active wavelengths in the UVC that could
have reached Earth's surface during the Archean. Proliferation of these
pigments can be understood as an autocatalytic photochemical process obeying
non-equilibrium thermodynamic directives related to increasing solar photon
dissipation rate. Under these directives, organic pigments would have evolved
over time to increase the global photon dissipation rate by; 1) increasing the
ratio of their effective photon cross sections to their physical size, 2)
decreasing their electronic excited state life times, 3) quenching
non-radiative de-excitation channels (e.g. fluorescence), 4) covering ever more
completely the solar spectrum, and 5) dispersing into an ever greater surface
area of Earth. From knowledge of the evolution of the spectrum of G-type stars,
and considering the most probable history of the transparency of Earths
atmosphere, we construct the most probable surface solar spectrum as a function
of time and compare this with the history of molecular absorption maxima
obtained from the available data in the literature. This comparison supports
the thermodynamic dissipation theory for the origin of life, constrains models

Especially cyclic motions can be represented elegantly in this framework.

relatively simple rules combined with spatial memory can give rise to complex

artificial selection for function has recently become a powerful tool for
understanding how evolution can innovate within its genetic rule space.
However, conventional cellular automata lack the kind of state feedback that is
surely present in natural evolving systems. Each new generation of a population
leaves an indelible mark on its environment and thus affects the selective
pressures that shape future generations of that population. To model this
phenomenon, we have augmented traditional cellular automata with
state-dependent feedback. Rather than generating automata executions from an
initial condition and a static rule, we introduce mappings which generate
iteration rules from the cellular automaton itself. We show that these new
automata contain disconnected regions which locally act like conventional
automata, thus encapsulating multiple functions into one structure.
Consequently, we have provided a new model for processes like cell
differentiation. Finally, by studying the size of these regions, we provide
additional evidence that the dynamics of self-reference may be critical to
understanding the evolution of natural language. In particular, the rules of
elementary cellular automata appear to be distributed in the same way as words

distribution of state-space models under highly informative observation
regimes, a situation in which standard SMC methods can perform poorly. A
special case is simulating bridges between given initial and final values. The
basic idea is to introduce a schedule of intermediate weighting and resampling
times between observation times, which guide particles towards the final state.
This can always be done for continuous-time models, and may be done for
discrete-time models under sparse observation regimes; our main focus is on
continuous-time diffusion processes. The methods are broadly applicable in that
they support multivariate models with partial observation, do not require
simulation of the backward transition (which is often unavailable), and, where
possible, avoid pointwise evaluation of the forward transition. When simulating
bridges, the last cannot be avoided entirely without concessions, and we
suggest an epsilon-ball approach (reminiscent of Approximate Bayesian
Computation) as a workaround. Compared to the bootstrap particle filter, the
new methods deliver substantially reduced mean squared error in normalising
constant estimates, even after accounting for execution time. The methods are
demonstrated for state estimation with two toy examples, and for parameter
estimation (within a particle marginal Metropolis--Hastings sampler) with three
applied examples in econometrics, epidemiology and marine biogeochemistry.

density (SD) of the ground state of CuCl2 using Density Functional Theory
(DFT), quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), and post-Hartree-Fock wavefunction theory
(WFT). A number of studies have shown that an accurate description of the
electronic structure of the lowest-lying states of this molecule is
particularly challenging due to the interplay between the strong dynamical
correlation effects in the 3d shell of the copper atom and the delocalization
of the 3d hole over the chlorine atoms. It is shown here that qualitatively
different results for SD are obtained from these various quantum-chemical
approaches. At the DFT level, the spin density distribution is directly related
to the amount of Hartree-Fock exchange introduced in hybrid functionals. At the
QMC level, Fixed-node Diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) results for SD are
strongly dependent on the nodal structure of the trial wavefunction employed
(here, Hartree-Fock or Kohn-Sham with a particular amount of HF exchange) : in
the case of this open-shell system, the 3N -dimensional nodes are mainly
determined by the 3-dimensional nodes of the singly occupied molecular orbital.
Regarding wavefunction approaches, HF and CASSCF lead to strongly localized
spin density on the copper atom, in sharp contrast with DFT. To get a more
reliable description and shed some light on the connections between the various
theoretical descriptions, Full CI-type (FCI) calculations are performed. To
make them feasible for this case a perturbatively selected CI approach
generating multi-determinantal expansions of reasonable size and a small
tractable basis set are employed. Although semi-quantitative, these near-FCI
calculations allow to clarify how the spin density distribution evolves upon
inclusion of dynamic correlation effects. A plausible scenario about the nature
of the SD is proposed.

tungsten sulfate, and so on, have attracted enormous attentions, due to their
unique combination of atomistic structures and superior thermal, mechanical,
and physical properties. Making use of mechanical buckling is a promising route
to control their structural morphology and thus tune their physical properties,
giving rise to many novel applications. In this paper, we employ finite element
analysis (FEA), molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and continuum modeling to
study the mechanical buckling of a column made of layered crystalline materials
with the crystal layers parallel to the longitudinal axis. It is found that the
mechanical buckling exhibits a gradual transition from a bending mode to a
shear mode of instability with the reduction of slenderness ratio. As the
slenderness ratio approaches to zero, the critical buckling strain {\epsilon}cr
converges to a finite value that is much smaller than the material's mechanical
strength, indicating that it is realizable under appropriate experimental
conditions. Such a mechanical buckling mode is anomalous and counter-intuitive.
The critical buckling strain {\epsilon}cr predicted by our continuum mechanics
model agrees very well with the results from the FEA and MD simulations for a
group of typical hexagonal layered crystalline materials. MD simulations on
graphite indicate the continuum mechanics model is applicable down to a scale
of 20 nm. This theoretical model also reveals that a high degree of elastic
anisotropy is the origin for the anomalous mechanical buckling of a column made
of layered crystalline materials in the absence of structural slenderness. This
study provides avenues for engineering layered crystalline materials in various
nano-materials and nano-devices via mechanical buckling.

event of a progenitor with D$>0.5\km$ is capable of producing several million
fragments in the $1\meter$ to $10\meter$ diameter range that can contribute to
temporary local density enhancements of small NEOs in Earth's vicinity. We
expect that there are about 1,200 objects in the steady state NEO population in

rotation and in the presence of a large-scale magnetic field. The angular
velocity $\Omega_0$ is assumed to be uniform and parallel to the constant
Alfv\'en speed ${\bf b_0}$. Such a system exhibits left and right circularly
polarized waves which can be obtained by introducing the magneto-inertial
length $d \equiv b_0/\Omega_0$. In the large-scale limit ($kd \to 0$; $k$ being
the wave number), the left- and right-handed waves tend respectively to the
inertial and magnetostrophic waves whereas in the small-scale limit ($kd \to +
\infty$) pure Alfv\'en waves are recovered. By using a complex helicity
decomposition, the asymptotic weak turbulence equations are derived which
describe the long-time behavior of weakly dispersive interacting waves {\it
via} three-wave interaction processes. It is shown that the nonlinear dynamics
is mainly anisotropic with a stronger transfer perpendicular ($\perp$) than
parallel ($\parallel$) to the rotating axis. The general theory may converge to
pure weak inertial/magnetostrophic or Alfv\'en wave turbulence when the large
or small-scales limits are taken respectively. Inertial wave turbulence is
asymptotically dominated by the kinetic energy/helicity whereas the
magnetostrophic wave turbulence is dominated by the magnetic energy/helicity.
For both regimes a family of exact solutions are found for the spectra which do
not correspond necessarily to a maximal helicity state. It is shown that the
hybrid helicity exhibits a cascade whose direction may vary according to the
scale $k_f$ at which the helicity flux is injected with an inverse cascade if
$k_fd < 1$ and a direct cascade otherwise. The theory is relevant for the
magnetostrophic dynamo whose main applications are the Earth and giant planets
for which a small ($\sim 10^{-6}$) Rossby number is expected.

The present notification system of dengue communicable diseases which is
enforced by law is a passive surveillance system carried out by the public
health care professionals. The present notification of communicable disease
system is manual, slow, inefficient, and repetitive all of these lead to handle
the dengue related health problems ineffectively. Thus it is less effective in
preventing a spreading epidemic, public health care professionals and others
require an operational support system to help for managing day-to-day public
health responsibilities as well as a method to effectively detect and manage
health problems such as Dengue. On the other hand the Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) in medical world has been widely used. To give
the information technology touch, a complementary web based open source
software application environment has been developed with minimum implementation
and recurrent costs critical for developing countries like Sri Lanka and named
as eDCS: e Dengue Control System based on the same principles of manual disease
surveillance system while taking steps to provide timely, accurate information
in a reliable and useable manner. The eDCS helps to manage outbreaks through
early detection, rapid verification, and appropriate response to Dengue. It
allows health care professionals and citizens to get early awareness about the
dengue disease via Internet or mobile phone and bring them for performing
Dengue prevention and controlling operation through the social media
acceleration. The system is initially limited to dengue communicable disease.
It can be easily expanded to other communicable diseases, and non communicable
disease surveillance in future.

considered. Each anomalous component of the system incurs a cost per unit time

most of the traditional partial order models like Mazurkiewicz traces, pomsets,
event structures, or Petri nets. Modal logics, interpreted over Kripke
structures, are the logics for reasoning about sequential behavior and
interleaved concurrency. Modal logic is a well behaved subset of first-order
logic; many variants of modal logic are decidable. However, there are no
modal-like logics for the more expressive HDA models. In this paper we
introduce and investigate a modal logic over HDAs which incorporates two
modalities for reasoning about ""during"" and ""after"". We prove that this general
higher dimensional modal logic (HDML) is decidable and we define an axiomatic
system for it. We also show how, when the HDA model is restricted to Kripke

Then we isolate the class of HDAs that encode Mazurkiewicz traces and show how
HDML, with natural definitions of corresponding Until operators, can be
restricted to LTrL (the linear time temporal logic over Mazurkiewicz traces) or
the branching time ISTL. We also study the expressiveness of the basic HDML

problem. We show that the addition of a fourth generation with vector-like
quarks to the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) can raise the
predicted value of the physical Higgs mass by mixing with the top sector. The
mixing requires a larger top quark Yukawa coupling (by up to $\sim 6 %$) to
produce the same top mass. Since loop corrections to $m_h$ go as $y_{top}^4$,
this will in turn increase the predicted value of the physical Higgs mass, a
point not previously emphasized in the literature. In the presence of mixing,
for A-terms and soft masses around 900 GeV, a Higgs mass of 125 GeV can be
generated while retaining perturbativity of the gauge couplings, evading
constraints from electroweak precision measurements (EWPM) and recent LHC
searches, and pushing the Landau pole for the top Yukawa above the GUT scale.
Soft masses can be as low as 800 GeV in parts of parameter space with a Landau
pole at $\sim 10^{10}$ GeV. However, the Landau pole can still be pushed above
the GUT scale if one sacrifices perturbative unification by adding fields in a
$\mathbf{5}$+$\mathbf{\bar{5}}$ representation. With a ratio of weak-scale
vector masses $\neq 1$, soft masses may be slightly below $800$ GeV. The model
predicts new quarks and squarks with masses $\gtrapprox 750$ GeV. We briefly
discuss potential paths for discovery or exclusion at the LHC.

enforce cooperation in the network, followed by extensive signal processing at
the network nodes. Instead, we address cooperative communication scenarios
which are governed by simple, evolutionary-like, local rules, and do not
require strategic complexity of the network nodes. The approach is motivated by
recent results in evolutionary biology which suggest that cooperation can
emerge in Nature by evolution, i. e. can be favoured by natural selection, if
certain mechanism is at work. As result, we are able to show by experiments
that cooperative behavior can indeed emerge and persist in wireless networks,
even if the behavior of the individual nodes is driven by selfish decision
making. The results from this work indicate that uncomplicated local rules,
followed by simple fitness evaluation, can promote cooperation and generate
network behavior which yields global energy efficiency in certain wireless
networks.

much information about a graph is revealed in its Potts partition function?'.
We show that the $W$-polynomial distinguishes non-isomorphic weighted trees of
a \emph{good} family. The framework developed to do so also allows us to show
that the $W$-polynomial distinguishes non-isomorphic caterpillars. This
establishes Stanley's isomorphism conjecture for caterpillars, an extensively

via four-wave mixing at a quasi-parallel laser collider for the first time. The
experiment demonstrates the novel approach to search for resonantly produced
sub-eV scalar fields by combining two-color laser fields in the vacuum. The aim
of this paper is to provide the concrete experimental setup and the analysis
method based on specific combinations of polarization states between incoming
and outgoing photons, which is extendable to higher intensity laser systems
operated at high repetition rates. No significant signal of four-wave mixing
was observed by combining a $0.2\mu$J/0.75ns pulse laser and a 2mW CW laser on
the same optical axis. Based on the prescription developed for this particular
experimental approach, we obtained the upper limit at a confidence level of 95%
on the coupling-mass relation.

starting from MgH2 and amorphous B in powder form as precursors, varying
reaction temperature and testing different cooling processes. We analyzed both
the MgB2 synthesis and the sintering process of tapes prepared with these
powders. Phase evolution, micro and crystallographic structure were monitored
during the different thermal treatments. Among the main results we observed the
formation of MgB2 at an extraordinary low temperature (300C), probably as a
result of a solid-state reaction between MgH2 and B. Furthermore, we studied
the dependence of the micro-structure upon the thermal treatment and its effect
on the critical current performance of the superconducting tapes.

interesting results have been obtained on gender conversation time, mental

optimization algorithms that works based on population and stochastic search.
In order to achieve acceptable result, there are many parameters needs to be
adjusted in AFSA. Among these parameters, visual and step are very significant
in view of the fact that artificial fish basically move based on these
parameters. In standard AFSA, these two parameters remain constant until the
algorithm termination. Large values of these parameters increase the capability
of algorithm in global search, while small values improve the local search
ability of the algorithm. In this paper, we empirically study the performance
of the AFSA and different approaches to balance between local and global
exploration have been tested based on the adaptive modification of visual and
step during algorithm execution. The proposed approaches have been evaluated
based on the four well-known benchmark functions. Experimental results show
considerable positive impact on the performance of AFSA.

X-rays and neither a prompt optical nor a radio afterglow were detected down to
deep limits. We identified the host galaxy of the burst, which is a typical
Lyman-break Galaxy (LBG) with R-magnitude of 24.06 +/- 0.10. A redshift of the
galaxy of z = 2.77 (-0.20,+0.15) is measured photometrically due to the
presence of a clear, strong Lyman-break feature. The host galaxy is a small
starburst galaxy with moderate intrinsic extinction (A_V = 0.3 mag) and has a
SFR of ~ 60 M_Sun / yr typical for LBGs. It is one of the few cases where a GRB
host has been found to be a classical Lyman-break galaxy. Using the redshift we
estimate the isotropic-equivalent radiated energy of the burst to be E_iso =

hypothesis that the darkness of GRB 051008 is due to local absorption resulting

related to Markov type stochastic processes due to temperature anisotropy and
the artificial collisions caused by using macro-particles and calculating the
space charge effect. The resulting noise can lead to growth of the
six-dimensional rms emittance and a suitably defined rms entropy. We confirm
the dependence of this growth on the bunch temperature anisotropy as predicted
by Struckmeier. However,we also find an apparently modified mechanism of noise
generation by the non-Liouvillean effect of the Poisson solver grid, which
exists in periodic focusing systems even in the complete absence of temperature
anisotropy. Our findings are applicable in particular to high current linac
simulation, where they can provide guidance to estimate noise effects and help
finding an effective balance between the number of simulation particles and the

(SF) galaxies. We do not find SFR-density or SSFR-density relations amongst SF
galaxies, and the location of the SF main sequence does not significantly
change with environment. Nevertheless, we find a tentative hint that
star-bursting galaxies (up-scattered objects from the main sequence) are
preferentially located in a small group at ~1-Mpc away from the main body of
the cluster. We also argue that the scatter of the SF main sequence could be
dependent on the distance to the nearest neighboring galaxy.

However, these sources are known for their strong and unpredictable

paper we consider the 28 blazars (14 BL Lac objects and 14 flat-spectrum radio
quasars, FSRQs) that are regularly monitored by the GLAST-AGILE Support Program
(GASP) of the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) since 2007. They show a
variety of infrared colours, redshifts, and infrared-optical spectral energy
distributions (SEDs), and thus represent an interesting mini-sample of bright
blazars that can be investigated in more detail. We present near-IR light
curves and colours obtained by the GASP from 2007 to 2013, and discuss the
infrared-optical SEDs. These are analysed with the aim of understanding the
interplay among different emission components. BL Lac SEDs are accounted for by
synchrotron emission plus an important contribution from the host galaxy in the
closest objects, and dust signatures in 3C 66A and Mkn 421. FSRQ SEDs require
synchrotron emission with the addition of a quasar-like contribution, which
includes radiation from a generally bright accretion disc, broad line region,
and a relatively weak dust torus.

  First, state-to-state rate constants for the H$_2(v=0,J=0,1)$+ O$^+$($^4S$)
$\rightarrow$ H + OH$^+(X ^3\Sigma^-, v', N)$ reaction have been obtained using
a quantum wave packet method. The calculations have been compared with
time-independent results to asses the accuracy of reaction probabilities at
collision energies of about 1 meV. The good agreement between the simulations
and the existing experimental cross sections in the $0.01-$1 eV energy range
shows the quality of the results.
  The calculated state-to-state rate constants have been fitted to an
analytical form. Second, the Einstein coefficients of OH$^+$ have been obtained
for all astronomically significant ro-vibrational bands involving the
$X^3\Sigma^-$ and/or $A^3\Pi$ electronic states.
  For this purpose the potential energy curves and electric dipole transition
moments for seven electronic states of OH$^+$ are calculated with {\it ab

rovibrational levels have been calculated including the empirical spin-rotation
and spin-spin terms. Third, the state-to-state rate constants for inelastic
collisions between He and OH$^+(X ^3\Sigma^-)$ have been calculated using a
time-independent close coupling method on a new potential energy surface. All
these rates have been implemented in detailed chemical and radiative transfer
models. Applications of these models to various astronomical sources show that
inelastic collisions dominate the excitation of the rotational levels of
OH$^+$. In the models considered the excitation resulting from the chemical
formation of OH$^+$ increases the line fluxes by about 10 % or less depending

that lack long or conserved open reading frames and which have been termed long

lncRNAs that play roles in the regulation of gene expression, the vast majority
of them do not yet have a known function. Motivated by the existence of
ribosome profiling data for several species, we have tested the hypothesis that
they may act as a repository for the synthesis of new peptides using data from
human, mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly, Arabidopsis and yeast. The ribosome
protection patterns are consistent with the presence of translated open reading
frames (ORFs) in a very large number of lncRNAs. Most of the ribosome-protected
ORFs are shorter than 100 amino acids and usually cover less than half the
transcript. Ribosome density in these ORFs is high and contrasts sharply with
the 3UTR region, in which very often there is no detectable ribosome binding,
similar to bona fide protein-coding genes. The coding potential of
ribosome-protected ORFs, measured using hexamer frequencies, is significantly
higher than that of randomly selected intronic ORFs and similar to that of
evolutionary young coding sequences. Selective constraints in
ribosome-protected ORFs from lncRNAs are lower than in typical protein-coding
genes but again similar to young proteins. These results strongly suggest that
lncRNAs play an important role in de novo protein evolution.

esthablished technique for achieving consensus when sensor data is encoded in
linear spaces. Gossip algorithms also have several extensions to non linear
data spaces. Most of these extensions deal with Riemannian manifolds and use
Riemannian gradient descent. This paper, instead, exhibits a very simple metric
property that do not rely on any differential structure. This property strongly
suggests that gossip algorithms could be studied on a broader family than
Riemannian manifolds. And it turns out that, indeed, (local) convergence is
guaranteed as soon as the data space is a mere $CAT(\kappa)$ metric space. We
also study convergence speed in this setting and establish linear rates for
$CAT(0)$ spaces, and local linear rates for $CAT(\kappa)$ spaces with $\kappa >
0$. Numerical simulations on several scenarii, with corresponding state spaces
that are either Riemannian manifolds -- as in the problem of positive definite
matrices consensus -- or bare metric spaces -- as in the problem of arms
consensus -- validate the results. This shows that not only does our metric
approach allows for a simpler and more general mathematical analysis but also
paves the way for new kinds of applications that go beyond the Riemannian

investigate the emergence of a horizon in models of black holes as
Bose-Einstein condensates of gravitons. We start from the Klein-Gordon equation
for a massless scalar (toy graviton) field coupled to a static matter current.
The (spherically symmetric) classical field reproduces the Newtonian potential
generated by the matter source, and the corresponding quantum state is given by
a coherent superposition of scalar modes with continuous occupation number.
Assuming an attractive self-interaction that allows for bound states, one finds
that (approximately) only one mode is allowed, and the system can be confined
in a region of the size of the Schwarzschild radius. This radius is then shown
to correspond to a proper horizon, by means of the horizon wave-function of the
quantum system, with an uncertainty in size naturally related to the expected
typical energy of Hawking modes. In particular, this uncertainty decreases for
larger black hole mass (with larger number of light scalar quanta), in
agreement with semiclassical expectations, a result which does not hold for a
single very massive particle. We finally speculate that a phase transition
should occur during the gravitational collapse of a star, ideally represented
by a static matter current and Newtonian potential, that leads to a black hole,
again ideally represented by the condensate of toy gravitons, and suggest an
effective order parameter that could be used to investigate this transition.

systems. Their exact analysis is unfeasible in most cases because of the state
space explosion. Approximations are usually sought, often with the goal of
reducing the number of variables. Among them, the mean field limit and the
quasi-equilibrium approximations stand out. We view them as techniques that are
rooted in independent basic principles. At the basis of the mean field limit is
the law of large numbers. The principle of the quasi-equilibrium reduction is
the separation of temporal scales. It is common practice to apply both limits
to an MPM yielding a fully reduced model. Although the two limits should be
viewed as completely independent options, they are applied almost invariably in
a fixed sequence: MF limit first, QE-reduction second. We present a framework
that makes explicit the distinction of the two reductions, and allows an
arbitrary order of their application. By inverting the sequence, we show that
the double limit does not commute in general: the mean field limit of a
time-scale reduced model is not the same as the time-scale reduced limit of a
mean field model. An example is provided to demonstrate this phenomenon.
Sufficient conditions for the two operations to be freely exchangeable are also
provided.

overall reliability risk. Monte Carlo sampling can be used with a power system
model to estimate this impact, but doing so is computationally expensive. This
paper presents a new approach to estimating the risk of large cascading
blackouts triggered by multiple contingencies. The method uses a search
algorithm (Random Chemistry) to identify blackout-causing contingencies, and
then combines the results with outage probabilities to estimate overall risk.
Comparing this approach with Monte Carlo sampling for two test cases (the IEEE
RTS-96 and a 2383 bus model of the Polish system) illustrates that the new
approach is at least two orders of magnitude faster than Monte Carlo, without
introducing measurable bias. Moreover, the approach enables one to compute the
sensitivity of overall blackout risk to individual component-failure
probabilities in the initiating contingency, allowing one to quickly identify
low-cost strategies for reducing risk. By computing the sensitivity of risk to
individual initial outage probabilities for the Polish system, we found that
reducing three line-outage probabilities by 50% would reduce cascading failure
risk by 33%. Finally, we used the method to estimate changes in risk as a
function of load. Surprisingly, this calculation illustrates that risk can
sometimes decrease as load increases.

Although the series is Borel summable, its Borel resummation does not agree
with the exact non-perturbative answer due to the presence of complex
instantons. The same type of behavior appears in the WKB quantization of the
quartic oscillator in Quantum Mechanics, which we analyze in detail as a toy
model for the string perturbation series. We conclude that, in these examples,
Borel summability is not enough for extracting non-perturbative information,
due to non-perturbative effects associated to complex instantons. We also
analyze the resummation of the genus expansion for topological string theory on
local $\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb P^1$, which is closely related to ABJM
theory. In this case, the non-perturbative answer involves membrane instantons
computed by the refined topological string, which are crucial to produce a
well-defined result. We give evidence that the Borel resummation of the

J2103.5+4545 with the goal of better characterizing the transient behaviour of
this source.
  Methods. SAX J2103.5+4545 was observed by Swift-XRT four times in 2007 from
April 25 to May 5, and during quiescence in 2012 August 31. In addition, this
source has been monitored from the ground-based astronomical observatories of
El Teide (Tenerife, Spain), Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma, Spain) and Sierra
Nevada (Granada, Spain) since 2011 August, and from the TUBITAK National
Observatory (Antalya, Turkey) since 2009 June. We have performed spectral and
photometric temporal analyses in order to investigate the different states
exhibited by SAX J2103.5+4545.
  Results. In X-rays, an absorbed power law model provided the best fit for all
the XRT spectra. An iron-line feature at ~6.42 keV was present in all the
observations except for that taken during quiescence in 2012. The photon
indexes are consistent with previous studies of SAX J2103.5+4545 in high/low
luminosity states. Pulsations were found in all the XRT data from 2007
(2.839(2) mHz; MJD 54222.02), but not during quiescence. Both optical outbursts
in 2010 and 2012 lasted for about 8/9 months (as the one in 2007 probably did
and the current one in 2014 might do) and were most probably caused by mass
ejection events from the Be star that eventually fed the circumstellar disc.
All of these outbursts started about 3 months before the triggering of the
X-ray activity, and about the same period before the maximum of the H_alpha
line equivalent width (in emission) was reached at only ~ -5 \AA. In this work
we found that the global correlation between the BV variability and the X-ray
intensity was also observed at longer wavelengths in the IR domain.

be a consequence of a first-order phase transition induced by interaction of a
fundamental non-linear scalar field with gravitational field. The Lagrangian
describing the scalar field f characterized by ""imaginary mass"" and
nonlinearity of ${\phi}^4$ type, existing in the space-time with non-zero
scalar curvature $R$, is proposed to be augmented with an additional linear
term $\propto R{\phi}$, along with the standard term $\propto R|{\phi}|^2$
quadratic in ${\phi}$. The term linear in ${\phi}$, playing the role of an
""external field"", leads to a cubic equation in ${\phi}$ for the extrema of the
potential energy of the scalar field and ensures the possibility of a
first-order phase transition driven by the parameter proportional to $R$. It is
assumed that the early Universe is filled with non-linear scalar field in the
ground state and cold matter, neutral with respect to all charges, satisfying
the equation of state $p={\nu}{\epsilon}$. It is shown that given the condition
${\nu}>1/3$ the scalar curvature $R={\kappa}(3{\nu}-1){\epsilon}-4{\Lambda}$
(where ${\Lambda}$ is the cosmological constant) decreases with diminishing of
the energy density of matter during the Universe's expansion and reaches
certain critical value $R_c<0$ when the first-order phase transition occurs.
Using parameters characterizing the Higgs field, the rapid ""roll-down"" of the
system into the potential minimum is shown to take place in a time span of
about $10^{-31}$ s. During this time the latent heat of the transition is
released increasing the temperature of the Universe to the Planck value
$T_P=10^{32}$ K, which may be seen as the ""Big Bang"" producing $4 \cdot
10^{30}$ GW of power.

and sinks of Capital (Assets) and real Goods (GDP) in the bulk. Uniqueness of
field theory of macroeconomics then can be derived from adapting Noether's
Theorems, which is based on the notion of invariants to derive unique field
equations. We will show that the only assumption which is needed for a
self-consistent non-linear macro-economic theory is that the well known
Quantity Equation, used in corrected formulation, holds at least locally in
time.
