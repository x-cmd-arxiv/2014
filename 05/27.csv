teleparallel gravity. Both cases of Minkowski and Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
branes embedded in Anti de Sitter bulk are studied and the effective 4-D action
were studied. 4-dimensional local Lorentz invariance is found to be recovered
in both cases. However, due to different junction conditions, the equations
governing the 4-D cosmological evolution differ from general relativistic case.
Using the results of Ref. [13], we consider a simple inflationary scenario in
this setup. The inflation parameters are found to be modified compared to
general relativistic case.

simple circuits under the effects of post-selection. A useful duality exists
between post-selected ensembles and a consistent picture of acausal physics
embodying the application of Novikov's consistency postulate to the
wave-function of a time machine. A competing view applies this postulate to
density matrices instead, but that lies outside the scope of this paper. To
find out the result of a measurement on a particular circuit, we consider a
weighted distribution of histories between some initial and final time, such
that each individually obeys ordinary quantum mechanics. The weight of a
particular history is given by a joint distribution over the values of a part
of the system dubbed the time machine, at two chosen times. In the dual
post-selection picture the weight is simply the probability for the 'periodic
bit' to satisfy the constraint, plus a small noise part, often assumed
constant, representing the error rate of the time machine's channel. The
emerging bit is one of a Bell pair, its partner kept in reserve to test that
the bit entering the time machine later matches the one which emerged. This is
done by interfering the incoming bit with the reserve member of the pair and
keeping the experimental runs that interfere constructively. Noise can be
effectively simulated by keeping a small proportion of runs that interfere
destructively, or by perturbing the reserve bit to decohere it by a similar
amount. Paradoxes remain but are tractable.

characterize the flow level performance, where the service rates are decided by
the spectrum partition. The spectrum allocation problem is formulated using a
conservative approximation, which makes the optimization problem convex. We
prove that in the optimal solution the spectrum is divided into at most $K$

properties of Wannier functions. To this end, we extend a recently proposed
compressed sensing based paradigm for the search for maximally localized
Wannier functions [Ozolins et al., PNAS 110, 18368 (2013)]. We develop a
practical toolbox that enables the search for maximally localized Wannier
functions which exactly obey the underlying physical symmetries of a
translationally invariant quantum lattice system under investigation. Most
saliently, this allows us to systematically identify the most localized
representative of a topological equivalence class of band structures, i.e., the
most localized set of Wannier functions that is adiabatically connected to a
generic initial representative. We also elaborate on the compressed sensing
scheme and find a particularly simple and efficient implementation in which
each step of the iteration is an $O(N \log N)$ algorithm in the number of
lattice sites $N$. We present benchmark results on one-dimensional topological
superconductors demonstrating the power of these tools. Furthermore, we employ
our method to address the open question whether compact Wannier functions can
exist for symmetry protected topological states like topological insulators in
two dimensions. The existence of such functions would imply exact flat band
models with strictly finite range hopping. Here, we find numerical evidence for
the absence of such functions. We briefly discuss applications in dissipative
state preparation and in devising variational sets of states for tensor network
methods.

the asymptotic CIS of any weighted nearest neighbor classifier turns out to be
proportional to the Euclidean norm of its weight vector. Based on this concise
form, we propose a stabilized nearest neighbor (SNN) classifier, which
distinguishes itself from other nearest neighbor classifiers, by taking the
stability into consideration. In theory, we prove that SNN attains the minimax
optimal convergence rate in risk, and a sharp convergence rate in CIS. The
latter rate result is established for general plug-in classifiers under a
low-noise condition. Extensive simulated and real examples demonstrate that SNN
achieves a considerable improvement in CIS over existing nearest neighbor
classifiers, with comparable classification accuracy. We implement the

voltage oscillations surviving up to $\sim7\,$K. Besides this remarkable

diffusion process, in path space, that matches marginals at two end points in
time; the likelihood is quantified by the relative entropy between the sought
law and a prior, and the law dictates a controlled path that abides by the
specified marginals. Schrodinger proved that the optimal steering of the
density between the two end points is effected by a multiplicative functional
transformation of the prior; this transformation represents an automorphism on
the space of probability measures and has since been studied by Fortet,
Beurling and others. A similar question can be raised for processes evolving in
a discrete time and space as well as for processes defined over non-commutative
probability spaces. The present paper builds on earlier work by Pavon and
Ticozzi and begins with the problem of steering a Markov chain between given
marginals. Our approach is based on the Hilbert metric and leads to an
alternative proof which, however, is constructive. More specifically, we show
that the solution to the Schrodinger bridge is provided by the fixed point of a
contractive map. We approach in a similar manner the steering of a quantum
system across a quantum channel. We are able to establish existence of quantum
transitions that are multiplicative functional transformations of a given Kraus
map, but only for the case of uniform marginals. As in the Markov chain case,
and for uniform density matrices, the solution of the quantum bridge can be
constructed from the fixed point of a certain contractive map. For arbitrary
marginal densities, extensive numerical simulations indicate that iteration of
a similar map leads to fixed points from which we can construct a quantum
bridge. For this general case, however, a proof of convergence remains elusive.

the matter creation model predicts a present dark matter-to-baryon ratio much
larger than that observed in massive X-ray clusters of galaxies, representing a

treatment indicates that baryons are not affected by the creation process but

was known that there is a family of unary promise problems solvable by quantum
automata by using a single qubit, but the number of states required by
corresponding one-way deterministic automata cannot be bounded by a constant.
For this family, we show that even two-way nondeterminism does not help to save
a single state. By comparing this with the corresponding state complexity of
alternating machines, we then get a tight exponential gap between two-way
nondeterministic and one-way alternating automata solving unary promise
problems. Second, despite of the existing quadratic gap between Las Vegas
realtime probabilistic automata and one-way deterministic automata for language
recognition, we show that, by turning to promise problems, the tight gap
becomes exponential. Last, we show that the situation is different for one-way
probabilistic automata with two-sided bounded-error. We present a family of
unary promise problems that is very easy for these machines; solvable with only
two states, but the number of states in two-way alternating or any simpler
automata is not limited by a constant. Moreover, we show that one-way
bounded-error probabilistic automata can solve promise problems not solvable at
all by any other classical model.

the tail of the halo pairwise velocity distribution with the potential of
providing a powerful test of cosmology. As an example it has been argued that
the discovery of the Bullet Cluster challenges standard $\Lambda$CDM model
predictions. Halo catalogs from N-body simulations have been used to estimate
the probability of Bullet-like clusters. However, due to simulation volume
effects previous studies had to rely on a Gaussian extrapolation of the
pairwise velocity distribution to high velocities. Here, we perform a detail
analysis using the halo catalogs from the Dark Energy Universe Simulation Full
Universe Runs (DEUS-FUR), which enables us to resolve the high-velocity tail of
the distribution and study its dependence on the halo mass definition, redshift
and cosmology. Building upon these results we estimate the probability of
Bullet-like systems in the framework of Extreme Value Statistics. We show that
the tail of extreme pairwise velocities significantly deviates from that of a
Gaussian, moreover it carries an imprint of the underlying cosmology. We find
the Bullet Cluster probability to be two orders of magnitude larger than
previous estimates, thus easing the tension with the $\Lambda$CDM model.
Finally, the comparison of the inferred probabilities for the different
DEUS-FUR cosmologies suggests that observations of extreme interacting clusters
can provide constraints on dark energy models complementary to standard
cosmological tests.

states) and growing states (anti-resonant states) parallelly. We can thereby
pinpoint the occurrence of the breaking of time-reversal symmetry at the choice
of whether we solve Schroedinger equation as an initial-condition problem or a
terminal-condition problem. Another feature of the complete set is that in the
subspace of the central scattering area of the system, it consists of
contributions of all states with point spectra but does not contain any

contribution of which point spectrum produces which time dependence. In the

over unperturbed eigenstates of the environmental area of the system and hence

of substantial interest when it is difficult to specify a full probabilistic
model. We propose a Bayesian flavored model selection framework based on
(quasi-)posterior probabilities from the Bayesian Generalized Method of Moments
(BGMM), which allows us to incorporate two important advantages of a Bayesian
approach: the expressiveness of posterior distributions and the convenient
computational method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Theoretically we show
that BGMM can achieve the posterior consistency for selecting the unknown true
model, and that it possesses a Bayesian version of the oracle property, i.e.
the posterior distribution for the parameter of interest is asymptotically
normal and is as informative as if the true model were known. In addition, we
show that the proposed quasi-posterior is valid to be interpreted as an
approximate posterior distribution given a data summary. Our applications
include modeling of correlated data, quantile regression, and graphical models

past years, as the ability to control quantum coherence on a single particle
level has been developed in a wide variety of physical systems. In quantum
optics, the study of open systems goes well beyond understanding the breakdown
of quantum coherence. There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently
well understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired
quantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in
quantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to
describe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems
generally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a
microscopic level. In recent years, AMO systems including cold atomic and
molecular gases and trapped ions have been applied heavily to the study of
many-body physics, and it has become important to extend previous understanding
of open system dynamics in single- and few-body systems to this many-body
context. A key formalism that has already proven very useful in this context is
the quantum trajectories technique. This was developed as a numerical tool for
studying dynamics in open quantum systems, and falls within a broader framework
of continuous measurement theory as a way to understand the dynamics of large
classes of open quantum systems. We review the progress that has been made in
studying open many-body systems in the AMO context, focussing on the
application of ideas from quantum optics, and on the implementation and
applications of quantum trajectories methods. Control over dissipative
processes promises many further tools to prepare interesting and important
states in strongly interacting systems, including the realisation of parameter
regimes in quantum simulators that are inaccessible via current techniques.

The Einstein equations are solved for a energy-momentum tensor which is
composed of a cosmological fluid and an electrostatic field outside a radius

identify a network's most influential nodes, but are rarely usefully accurate
in quantifying the spreading power of the vast majority of nodes which are not
highly influential. The spreading power of all network nodes is better
explained by considering, from a continuous-time epidemiological perspective,
the distribution of the force of infection each node generates. The resulting
metric, the \textit{expected force}, accurately quantifies node spreading power
under all primary epidemiological models across a wide range of archetypical
human contact networks. When node power is low, influence is a function of
neighbor degree. As power increases, a node's own degree becomes more
important. The strength of this relationship is modulated by network structure,
being more pronounced in narrow, dense networks typical of social networking
and weakening in broader, looser association networks such as the Internet. The
expected force can be computed independently for individual nodes, making it
applicable for networks whose adjacency matrix is dynamic, not well specified,
or overwhelmingly large.

Dark Minimal Flavor Violation (DMFV) and highlight its various implications,

AGN emission lines that exhibit statistically significant line-of-sight
velocity offsets relative to systemic. From a parent sample of 18314 Type 2
AGNs at z<0.21, we identify 351 offset AGN candidates with velocity offsets of

designed our selection criteria to bypass velocity offsets produced by rotating
gas disks, AGN outflows, and gravitational recoil of supermassive black holes,
but follow-up observations are still required to confirm our candidates as
offset AGNs. We find that the fraction of AGNs that are offset candidates
increases with AGN bolometric luminosity, from 0.7% to 6% over the luminosity
range 43 < log(L_bol) [erg/s] < 46. If these candidates are shown to be bona

simulations. The HI is assigned a-posteriori to the gas particles following two
different approaches: a halo-based method in which HI is assigned only to gas
particles residing within dark matter halos; a particle-based method that
assigns HI to all gas particles using a prescription based on the physical
properties of the particles. The HI statistical properties are then compared to
the observational properties of Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ Absorbers (DLAs) and of
lower column density systems and reasonable good agreement is found for all the
cases. Among the halo-based method, we further consider two different schemes
that aim at reproducing the observed properties of DLAs by distributing HI
inside halos: one of this results in a much higher bias for DLAs, in agreement
with recent observations, which boosts the 21 cm power spectrum by a factor
$\sim 4$ with respect to the other recipe. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum
from the simulated HI distribution and calculate the expected signal for both
SKA1-mid and SKA1-low configurations at $2.4 \leq z \leq 4$. We find that SKA
will be able to detect the 21 cm power spectrum, in the non-linear regime, up
to $k\sim 1\,h$/Mpc for SKA1-mid and $k\sim 5\,h$/Mpc for SKA1-low with 100
hours of observations. We also investigate the perspective of imaging the HI
distribution. Our findings indicate that SKA1-low could detect the most massive
HI peaks with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) higher than 5 for an observation
time of about 1000 hours at $z=4$, for a synthesized beam width of $2'$.
Detection at redshifts $z\geqslant2.4$ with SKA1-mid would instead require a
much longer observation time to achieve a comparable SNR level.

19-parameter p(henomenological)MSSM which provides a general framework for
complementarity studies of neutralino dark matter. We summarize the sensitivity
of dark matter searches at the 7, 8 (and eventually 14) TeV LHC, combined with
those by \Fermi, CTA, IceCube/DeepCore, COUPP, LZ and XENON. The strengths and
weaknesses of each of these techniques are examined and contrasted and their
interdependent roles in covering the model parameter space are discussed in
detail. We find that these approaches explore orthogonal territory and that
advances in each are necessary to cover the Supersymmetric WIMP parameter
space. We also find that different experiments have widely varying
sensitivities to the various dark matter annihilation mechanisms, some of which
would be completely excluded by null results from these experiments.

any form for the Galactic potential: it works in phase-space rather than
action-space and hence relies neither on our ability to derive actions nor on

likelihood function and priors on the parameters. The method can properly
account for finite observational uncertainties and missing data dimensions. We
test our method on synthetic datasets generated from N-body simulations of
satellite disruption in a static, multi-component Milky Way including a
triaxial dark matter halo with observational uncertainties chosen to mimic
current and near-future surveys of various stars. We find that with just four
well-measured stream stars, we can infer properties of a triaxial potential

that the nonperturbative contributions involve only odd powers of $R$, and the

leakage scheme that accounts for heating due to neutrino absorption in
optically thin conditions. Consistent with the 2D study of Dessart et al.
(2009), we find that a strong baryonic wind is blown out along the original
binary rotation axis within $100$ ms after the merger. We compute a lower limit
on the expelled mass of $3.5 \times 10^{-3} M_{\odot}$, large enough to be
relevant for heavy element nucleosynthesis. The physical properties vary
significantly between different wind regions. For example, due to stronger
neutrino irradiation, the polar regions show substantially larger $Y_e$ than
those at lower latitudes. This has its bearings on the nucleosynthesis: the
polar ejecta produce interesting r-process contributions from $A\sim 80$ to
about 130, while the more neutron-rich, lower-latitude parts produce also
elements up to the third r-process peak near $A\sim 195$. We also calculate the
properties of electromagnetic transients that are powered by the radioactivity
in the wind, in addition to the macronova transient that stems from the dynamic
ejecta. The high-latitude (polar) regions produce UV/optical transients
reaching luminosities up to $10^{41} {\rm erg \, s^{-1}}$, which peak around 1
day in optical and 0.3 days in bolometric luminosity. The lower-latitude
regions, due to their contamination with high-opacity heavy elements, produce
dimmer and more red signals, peaking after $\sim 2$ days in optical and

decompose arbitrary diagonal quantum gates to a set of multiplexed-rotation
gates around z axis. In this paper, a special class of diagonal quantum gates,
namely diagonal Hermitian quantum gates, is considered and a new perspective to
the decomposition problem with respect to decomposing these gates is presented.
It is first shown that these gates can be decomposed to a set that solely
consists of multiple-controlled Z gates. Then a binary representation for the
diagonal Hermitian gates is introduced. It is shown that the binary
representations of multiple-controlled Z gates form a basis for the vector
space that is produced by the binary representations of all diagonal Hermitian
quantum gates. Moreover, the problem of decomposing a given diagonal Hermitian
gate is mapped to the problem of writing its binary representation in the
specific basis mentioned above. Moreover, CZ gate is suggested to be the
two-qubit gate in the decomposition library, instead of previously used CNOT
gate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can lead to circuits
with lower costs in comparison with the previous ones.

velocity gradients in H$^{13}$CO$^+$ 4-3 and C$^{17}$O 3-2, and magnetic field
segments well aligned to the dust main axis. The velocity gradient is well
reproduced by a spiral arm expanding at 9 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the

a key question in cosmology. Direct collapse black holes (DCBH) that form in
pristine, atomic-line cooling halos, illuminated by a Lyman-Werner (LW) UV flux
exceeding a critical threshold J_crit, represent an attractive possibility. We
investigate when and where these conditions are met during cosmic evolution.
For the LW intensity, J_LW, we account for departures from the background value
in close proximity to star forming galaxies. For the pristine halo fraction, we
account for both (i) supernova driven outflows, and (ii) the inherent pollution
from progenitor halos. We estimate the abundance of DCBH formation sites,
n_DCBH(z), and find that it increases with cosmic time from n_DCBH(z=20) ~
1e-12 -1e-7 cMpc^-3 to n_DCBH(z=10) ~ 1e-10 - 1e-5 cMpc^-3. Our analysis shows
the possible importance of galactic winds, which can suppress the predicted
n_DCBH by several orders of magnitude, and cause DCBH formation to
preferentially occur around the UV-brightest (M_UV ~ -22 to -20) star forming
galaxies. Our analysis further highlights the dependence of these predictions
on (i) the escape fraction of LW photons, (ii) J_crit, and (iii) the galactic
outflow prescription.

an asymptotic scale at x_0. By analytic theory, as opposed to the set of
algebraic rules for manipulating finite asymptotic expansions, we mean
sufficient and/or necessary conditions of general practical usefulness in order
that (*) hold true. Our theory is concerned with functions which are
differentiable (n-1) or n times and the presented conditions involve
integro-differential operators acting on f, phi_1, dots, phi_n. We essentially
use two approaches; one of them is based on canonical factorizations of
nth-order disconjugate differential operators and gives conditions expressed as
convergence of certain improper integrals, very useful for applications. The
other approach, valid for (n-1)-time differentiable functions starts from
simple geometric considerations (as old as Newton's concept of limit tangent)
and gives conditions expressed as the existence of finite limits, as x tends to
x_0, of certain Wronskian determinants constructed with f, phi_1, dots, phi_n.
There is a link between the two approaches and it turns out that the integral
conditions found via the factorizational approach have striking geometric
meanings. Our theory extends to general expansions the theory of polynomial
asymptotic expansions thoroughly investigated in a previous paper. In the first
part of our work we study the case of two comparison functions phi_1, phi_2.
The theoretical background for the two-term theory is much simpler than that
for n >=3 and, in addition, it is unavoidable to separate the treatments as the
two-term formulas must be explicitly written lest they become unreadable.

keV band are dominated by a hard power-law component of a photon index of
\approx 1.6 with a high-energy cutoff at \approx 60 keV, which is well
described with Comptonization of the disk emission by hot corona. We estimate
the inner disk radius from the multi-color disk component, and find that it is
1.3-2.3 times larger than the radius in the high/soft state. This suggests that
the standard disk was not extended to the innermost stable circular orbit. A
reflection component from the disk is detected with R = \Omega/2\pi \approx 0.6
(\Omega is the solid angle). We also successfully estimate the stable disk
component in a way independent of the time-averaged spectral modeling, by
analyzing short-term spectral variability on the \sim 1-sec timescale. A weak
low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (LF QPO) at 0.1-0.2 Hz is detected,

Morphological differences between the stars and ionized gas are not reflected
dynamically as stellar kinematics are found the be closely coupled to the
kinematics of the ionized gas: both components are smoothly rotating with large
velocity dispersions (~40 km/s) suggesting that the high gas dispersions are
not primarily driven by star-formation feedback. In addition, the stellar
population ages of these galaxies are estimated to be quite young (60-500 Myr).
The large velocity dispersions measured for these young stars suggest that we
are seeing the formation of thick disks and/or stellar bulges in support of
recent models which produce these from clumpy galaxies at high redshift.

by us over the past few years, one that yields mathematically rigorous
solutions to longstanding important questions that have remained unresolved:
(i) how to design reliable, convergent, and robust reinforcement learning
algorithms (ii) how to guarantee that reinforcement learning satisfies
pre-specified ""safety"" guarantees, and remains in a stable region of the
parameter space (iii) how to design ""off-policy"" temporal difference learning
algorithms in a reliable and stable manner, and finally (iv) how to integrate
the study of reinforcement learning into the rich theory of stochastic
optimization. In this paper, we provide detailed answers to all these questions
using the powerful framework of proximal operators.
  The key idea that emerges is the use of primal dual spaces connected through
the use of a Legendre transform. This allows temporal difference updates to
occur in dual spaces, allowing a variety of important technical advantages. The
Legendre transform elegantly generalizes past algorithms for solving
reinforcement learning problems, such as natural gradient methods, which we
show relate closely to the previously unconnected framework of mirror descent
methods. Equally importantly, proximal operator theory enables the systematic
development of operator splitting methods that show how to safely and reliably
decompose complex products of gradients that occur in recent variants of
gradient-based temporal difference learning. This key technical innovation
makes it possible to finally design ""true"" stochastic gradient methods for
reinforcement learning. Finally, Legendre transforms enable a variety of other
benefits, including modeling sparsity and domain geometry. Our work builds
extensively on recent work on the convergence of saddle-point algorithms, and
on the theory of monotone operators.

Fierz bilinear formulation of the Maxwell tensor and of the Maxwell-Dirac

demanding invariance of tensor fields under the action of a fixed (but

number count of neighbor galaxies, the overdensity of the local environment,
and the membership of our galaxies to galaxy groups to segregate central and
satellite systems. For barred galaxies as a whole, we find a very weak
difference in all the quantities compared to unbarred galaxies of the control

weak but significant trend for early-type galaxies with a bar to be more
strongly clustered on scales from a few 100 kpc to 1 Mpc when compared to
unbarred early-type galaxies. This indicates that the presence of a bar in
early-type galaxies depends on the location within their host dark matter
halos. This is confirmed by the group catalog in the sense that for
early-types, the fraction of central galaxies is smaller if they have a bar.
For late-type galaxies, we find fewer neighbors within $\sim$50 kpc around the

possible to remove such fields introducing extra number of e-foldings prior to
$N_e\sim 60$, however such extra e-foldings may make the trans-Planckian
problem worse due to the Lyth bound. We show that such extra scalar fields can
change the running of the spectral index to give correction of $\pm 0.01$

to the spectral index (and the amplitude) could be important in considering
global behavior of the corrected spectrum, although they can be neglected in

operating parameters of both macro and femtocells should be carefully chosen
according to the mobile operator's policy, consumer's requirements, and so on.
We propose long-term parameter optimization schemes, which maximize the average
throughput of macrocell users while guaranteeing some degree of benefits to
femtocell owners. To achieve this goal, we jointly optimize the ratio of
dedicated resources for femtocells as well as the femtocell service area in
open access femtocell networks through the numerical analysis. It is proved
that the optimal parameter selection of open access femtocell is a convex
optimization problem in typical environments. Then, we extend our algorithm to
hybrid access femtocells where some intra-femtocell resources are dedicated
only for femtocell owners while remaining resources are shared with foreign
macrocell users. Our evaluation results show that the proposed parameter
optimization schemes significantly enhance the performance of macrocell users
thanks to the large offloading gain. The benefits provided to femtocell users
are also adaptively maintained according to the femtocell users' requirements.
The results in this paper provide insights about the situations where femtocell
deployment on dedicated channels is preferred to the co-channel deployment.

confined. It appears as a compact-loop flare in the traditional EUV passbands
(171 and 195 {\AA}), but in the passbands sensitive to flare plasmas (94 and
131 {\AA}), it exhibits a cusp-shaped structure above an arcade of loops like
other long-duration events. Inspecting images in a running difference approach,
we find that the seemingly diffuse, quasi-static cusp-shaped structure consists
of multiple nested loops that repeatedly rise upward and disappear approaching
the cusp edge. Over the gradual phase, we detect numerous episodes of loop
rising, each lasting minutes. A differential emission measure analysis reveals
that the temperature is highest at the top of the arcade and becomes cooler at
higher altitudes within the cusp-shaped structure, contrary to typical
long-duration flares. With a nonlinear force-free model, our analysis shows
that the event mainly involves two adjacent sheared arcades separated by a
T-type hyperbolic flux tube (HFT). One of the arcades harbors a magnetic flux
rope, which is identified with a filament that survives the flare owing to the
strong confining field. We conclude that a new emergence of magnetic flux in
the other arcade triggers the flare, while the preexisting HFT and flux rope
dictate the structure and dynamics of the flare loops and ribbons during the
long-lasting decay phase, and that a quasi-separatrix layer high above the HFT
could account for the cusp-shaped structure.

multi-resolution analysis (MRA) framework. The MRA framework is formulated out
of a mutually nesting displacement subspace sequence, whose basis functions are
constructed of scaling and shifting on the element domain of a basic node shape
function. The basic node shape function is constructed from extending to other
seven quadrants around a specific node of a node isoparametric shape function.
The MRA endows the proposed element with the resolution level (RL) to adjust
the element node number, thus modulating structural analysis accuracy
accordingly. As a result, the traditional 8-node hexahedron element and method
is a mono-resolution one and also a special case of the proposed element and
method. The accuracy of a structural analysis is actually determined by the RL,
not by the mesh. The simplicity and clarity of shape function construction with
the Kronecker delta property and the rational MRA enable the proposed element
method to be more rational, easier and efficient in its implementation than the
conventional mono-resolution solid element method or other MRA methods. The
multi-resolution hexahedron element is more adapted to dealing with the
accurate computation of structural problems.

in the bad-cavity regime, the proposed scheme can operate effectively with much
stronger incident fields, while also preserving their coherent nature. It can
also serve to prepare an entangled state of the atom and coherent optical

is analyzed and compared with available experimental data. We also pay
attention to isomeric states, the deformation properties of the fragments as
well as to the competition between the spontaneous fission and $\alpha$-decay

demonstrated with the help of calculations for $^{232-280}$Pu in which the

policy based on which PMU transmissions are ordered during a time frame.
  The scheduling scheme is independent of the approach taken to solve the PMU

equivalently, conjunctions) on symmetric distributions over $\{0,1\}^n$.
Symmetric distributions are distributions whose PDF is invariant under any
permutation of the variables. We give a simple proof that for every symmetric
distribution $\mathcal{D}$, there exists a set of $n^{O(\log{(1/\epsilon)})}$
functions $\mathcal{S}$, such that for every disjunction $c$, there is function
$p$, expressible as a linear combination of functions in $\mathcal{S}$, such
that $p$ $\epsilon$-approximates $c$ in $\ell_1$ distance on $\mathcal{D}$ or
$\mathbf{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}}[ |c(x)-p(x)|] \leq \epsilon$. This directly
gives an agnostic learning algorithm for disjunctions on symmetric
distributions that runs in time $n^{O( \log{(1/\epsilon)})}$. The best known
previous bound is $n^{O(1/\epsilon^4)}$ and follows from approximation of the
more general class of halfspaces (Wimmer, 2010). We also show that there exists
a symmetric distribution $\mathcal{D}$, such that the minimum degree of a
polynomial that $1/3$-approximates the disjunction of all $n$ variables is
$\ell_1$ distance on $\mathcal{D}$ is $\Omega( \sqrt{n})$. Therefore the
learning result above cannot be achieved via $\ell_1$-regression with a
polynomial basis used in most other agnostic learning algorithms.
  Our technique also gives a simple proof that for any product distribution
$\mathcal{D}$ and every disjunction $c$, there exists a polynomial $p$ of
degree $O(\log{(1/\epsilon)})$ such that $p$ $\epsilon$-approximates $c$ in
$\ell_1$ distance on $\mathcal{D}$. This was first proved by Blais et al.

models of micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS). The problem involves a
source term with a spatially dependent potential, given by the dielectric
permittivity profile, and quenching corresponds to a touchdown phenomenon. It
is well known that quenching does occur. We prove that {\bf touchdown cannot
occur at zero points of the permittivity profile.} In particular, we remove the
assumption of compactness of the touchdown set, made in all previous work on
the subject {and whose validity is unknown in most typical cases.} This answers
affirmatively a conjecture made in {[\it Y. Guo, Z. Pan and M.J. Ward, SIAM
J.Appl. Math {\textbf{66} (2005)}, 309--338]} on the basis of numerical
evidence. The result crucially depends on a new type~I estimate of the
quenching rate, that we establish. In addition we obtain some sufficient
conditions for compactness of the touchdown set, without convexity assumption
on the domain. These results may be of some qualitative importance in
applications to MEMS optimal design, especially for devices such as
micro-valves.

of frustrated antiferromagnet YMn1-xFexO3 (x less than or equal to 0.5) has
been investigated. The neutron diffraction analysis shows that the structure of
these polycrystalline samples changes from hexagonal phase (space group P63cm)
to orthorhombic phase (space group Pnma) for x > 0.2. The frustration parameter
decreases with Fe substitution. All the compounds are antiferromagnetic and the
magnetic structure is described as a mixture of {\Gamma}3 and {\Gamma}4
irreducible representation (IR) in the hexagonal phase and the ratio of these
two IRs is found to vary with Fe doping (x less than or equal to 0.2). A
continuous spin reorientation as a function of temperature is observed in these
samples. The magnetic ground state in the orthorhombic phase of the higher
doped samples (x greater than or equal to 0.3) is explained by taking {\Gamma}1
(GxCyAz) representation of Pnma setting. In YMnO3 suppression of dielectric
constant {\epsilon} is observed below Tn indicative of magnetoelectric
coupling. This anomalous behavior reduces in Fe doped samples. The dielectric
constant is found to be correlated with the magnetic moment (M) obtained from
neutron diffraction experiments and follows a M^2 behavior close to Tn in
agreement with Landau theory.

problem in machine learning and computer vision. Many the solutions to the
problem require to perform logic operations such as `and', `or', and `not'.
Classification and regression tree (CART) include these operations explicitly.
Other methods such as neural networks, SVM, and boosting learn/compute a
weighted sum on features (weak classifiers), which weakly perform the 'and' and
'or' operations. However, it is hard for these classifiers to deal with the
'xor' pattern directly. In this paper, we propose layered logic classifiers for
patterns of complicated distributions by combining the `and', `or', and `not'
operations. The proposed algorithm is very general and easy to implement. We
test the classifiers on several typical datasets from the Irvine repository and
two challenging vision applications, object segmentation and pedestrian
detection. We observe significant improvements on all the datasets over the
widely used decision stump based AdaBoost algorithm. The resulting classifiers
have much less training complexity than decision tree based AdaBoost, and can
be applied in a wide range of domains.

distribution of mixed polarity magnetic field in the solar photosphere. To this
end we consider numerical simulations that cover the uppermost 2-6 Mm of the
solar convection zone and we explore scales ranging from 2 km to 25 Mm. We
study how the strength and distribution of magnetic field in the photosphere
and subsurface layers depend on resolution, domain size and boundary
conditions. We find that 50% of the magnetic energy at the \tau=1 level comes
from field with the less than 500 G strength and that 50% of the energy resides
on scales smaller than about 100 km. While probability distribution functions
are essentially independent of resolution, properly describing the spectral
energy distribution requires grid spacings of 8 km or smaller. The formation of
flux concentrations in the photosphere exceeding 1 kG requires a mean vertical
field strength greater than 30-40 G at \tau=1. The filling factor of kG flux
concentrations increases with overall domain size as magnetic field becomes
organized by larger, longer lived flow structures. A solution with a mean
vertical field strength of around 85 G at \tau=1 requires a subsurface RMS
field strength increasing with depth at the same rate as the equipartition
field strength. We consider this an upper limit for the quiet Sun field
strength, which implies that most of the convection zone is magnetized close to
equipartition. We discuss these findings in view of recent high-resolution
spectropolarimetric observations of quiet Sun magnetism.

standards and tools. In this area, the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) has
rapidly become the defacto standard in the MDSE for building Domain Specific

EMF generated tools in domains like Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing

several properties the generated tools must comply with to be usable in other

the broadband and coherent emission from secondary relativistic particles, as
they move along a flux tube in a dipolar magnetic field, forms a radially
extended sub-beam with unique properties. The whole radio beam may consist of
several sub-beams, forming a fan-shaped pattern. When only one or a few flux
tubes are active, the fan beam becomes very patchy. This model differs
essentially from the conal beam models in the respects of beam structure and
predictions on the relationship between pulse width and impact angle $\beta$
(the angle between line of sight and magnetic pole) and the relationship
between emission intensity and beam angular radius. The evidence for this model
comes from the observed patchy beams of precessional binary pulsars and three
statistical relationships found for a sample of 64 pulsars, of which $\beta$
were mostly constrained by fitting polarization position angle data with the
Rotation Vector Model. With appropriate assumptions, the fan beam model can
reproduce the relationship between 10\% peak pulse width and $|\beta|$, the
anticorrelation between the emission intensity and $|\beta|$, and the upper
boundary line in the scatter plot of $|\beta|$ versus pulsar distance. An
extremely patchy beam model with the assumption of narrowband emission from one
or a few flux tubes is studied and found unlikely to be a general model. The
implications of the fan beam model to the studies on radio and gamma-ray pulsar
populations and radio polarization are discussed.

from a quadrupolar field configuration, in which the prominence was embedded in
a side-arcade. Within the two-day period prior to its eruption on 2012 October
22, the prominence was perturbed three times by chromospheric fibrils
underneath, which rose upward, became brightened, and merged into the
prominence, resulting in horizontal flows along the prominence axis, suggesting
that the fluxes carried by the fibrils were incorporated into the magnetic
field of the prominence. These perturbations caused the prominence to oscillate
and to rise faster than before. The absence of intense heating within the first
two hours after the onset of the prominence eruption, which followed an
exponential increase in height, indicates that ideal instability played a
crucial role. The eruption involved interactions with the other side-arcade,
leading up to a twin coronal mass ejection, which was accompanied by transient
surface brightenings in the central arcade, followed by transient dimmings and
brightenings in the two side-arcades. We suggest that flux feeding from

collisions is essential when modelling a range of astrophysical systems, such
as debris disks and planetary rings. While the slope of the fragment size
distribution and the size of the largest fragment are well known, the behaviour
of the distribution at the small size end is theoretically and experimentally
poorly understood. This leads debris disk codes to generally assume a limit
equal to, or below, the radiation blow-out size. We use energy conservation to
analytically derive a lower boundary of the fragment size distribution for a
range of collider mass ratios. Focussing on collisions between equal-sized
bodies, we apply the method to debris disks. For a given collider mass, the
size of the smallest fragments is found to depend on collision velocity,
material parameters, and the size of the largest fragment. We provide a
physically motivated recipe for the calculation of the smallest fragment, which
can be easily implemented in codes for modelling collisional systems. For
plausible parameters, our results are consistent with the observed predominance
of grains much larger than the blow-out size in Fomalhaut's main belt and in
the Herschel cold debris disks.

3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a torus. Concretely, for any
$N>0$, let $w_N$ be the sum of all spectral components of the velocity fields
whose all three wave numbers are greater than $N$ absolutely. Then, we show
that for any $N>0$, the finiteness of the Serrin type norm of $w_N$ implies the
regularity of the flow. It implies that if the flow breaks down in a finite
time, the energy of the velocity fields cascades down to the arbitrarily large
spectral components of $w_N$ and corresponding energy spectrum, in some sense,
roughly decays slower than $\kappa^{-2}$

appearance, the DQC1 model can efficiently solve some problems for which no

that the DQC1 model is more powerful than classical computing (under the
assumption of $\mbox{BPP}\subsetneq\mbox{BQP}$). Here we show that the output

data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1 fb$^{-1}$ at a
centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, recorded in the forward region with the LHCb

transverse momentum, $p_T$, and pseudorapidity, $\eta$, of the beauty hadron,
in the studied kinematic region $1.5 < p_T < 40$ GeV/$c$ and $2 < \eta < 5$.
Using a previous LHCb measurement of $f_{\Lambda_b^0}/f_d$ in semileptonic

second is systematic, the third is from the previous LHCb measurement of

encrypted images have been studied individually in recent years. However,
little work has been done in the robust coding of encrypted images. The
existing results in these two individual research areas cannot be combined
directly for the robust coding of encrypted images. This is because the robust
coding of natural images relies on the elimination of spatial correlations
using sparse transforms such as discrete wavelet transform (DWT), which is
ineffective to encrypted images due to the weak correlation between encrypted
pixels. Moreover, the compression of encrypted images always generates code
streams with different significance. If one or more such streams are lost, the
quality of the reconstructed images may drop substantially or decoding error
may exist, which violates the goal of robust coding of encrypted images. In
this work, we intend to design a robust coder, based on compressive sensing
with structurally random matrix, for encrypted images over packet transmission
networks. The proposed coder can be applied in the scenario that Alice needs a
semi-trusted channel provider Charlie to encode and transmit the encrypted
image to Bob. In particular, Alice first encrypts an image using globally
random permutation and then sends the encrypted image to Charlie who samples
the encrypted image using a structural matrix. Through an imperfect channel
with packet loss, Bob receives the compressive measurements and reconstructs
the original image by joint decryption and decoding. Experimental results show
that the proposed coder can be considered as an efficient multiple description
coder with a number of descriptions against packet loss.

methods is often being studied to obtain the characteristics of a large complex
network. However, little attention has been paid to sampling from directed
networks such as WWW and Peer-to-Peer networks. In this paper, we propose a
novel two-step (sampling/estimation) framework to measure nodal characteristics
which can be defined by an average target function in an arbitrary directed
network. To this end, we propose a personalized PageRank-based algorithm to
visit and sample nodes. This algorithm only uses already visited nodes as local
information without any prior knowledge about the latent structure of the
network. Moreover, we introduce a new estimator based on the approximate
importance sampling to estimate average target functions. The proposed
estimator utilizes calculated PageRank value of each sampled node as an
approximation for the exact visiting probability. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study on correcting the bias of a sampling method by
re-weighting of measured values that considers the effect of approximation of
visiting probabilities. Comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of the
estimator demonstrate that it is asymptotically unbiased even in situations
where stationary distribution of PageRank is poorly approximated.

most planetesimals) from newly available spectral measurements and
mineralogical analysis of main belt S-type asteroids (83 objects) and
unequilibrated ordinary chondrite meteorites (53 samples). Based on the latter,
we suggest spectral data may be used to distinguish whether an ordinary
chondrite was formed near the surface or in the interior of its parent body. If
these constraints are correct, the suggested implications include that: i)
large groups of compositionally similar asteroids are a natural outcome of
planetesimal formation and, consequently, meteorites within a given class can
originate from multiple parent bodies; ii) the surfaces of large (up to ~200km)
S-type main-belt asteroids expose mostly the interiors of the primordial
bodies, a likely consequence of impacts by small asteroids (D<10km) in the
early solar system (Ciesla et al. 2013); iii) the duration of accretion of the
H chondrite parent bodies was likely short (instantaneous or in less then ~10^5
yr but certainly not as long as 1 Myr); iv) LL-like bodies formed closer to the
Sun than H-like bodies, a possible consequence of radial mixing and size
sorting of chondrules in the protoplanetary disk prior to accretion.

complex pulse-profile morphologies. Significant deviations from the average
pulse profile can appear, in particular close to the cyclotron line energies.
These deviations can be described as energy-dependent phase lags, that is, as
energy-dependent shifts of main features in the pulse profile. Aims: Using a
numerical study we explore the effect of cyclotron resonant scattering on
observable, energy-resolved pulse profiles. Methods: We generated the
observable emission as a function of spin phase, using Monte Carlo simulations
for cyclotron resonant scattering and a numerical ray-tracing routine
accounting for general relativistic light-bending effects on the intrinsic
emission from the accretion columns. Results: We find strong changes in the
pulse profile coincident with the cyclotron line energies. Features in the
pulse profile vary strongly with respect to the average pulse profile with the
observing geometry and shift and smear out in energy additionally when assuming
a non-static plasma. Conclusions: We demonstrate how phase lags at the
cyclotron energies arise as a consequence of the effects of angular
redistribution of X-rays by cyclotron resonance scattering in a strong magnetic
field combined with relativistic effects. We also show that phase lags are
strongly dependent on the accretion geometry. These intrinsic effects will in
principle allow us to constrain a system's accretion geometry.

on the directed flow of charged pions. For intermediate centrality Au+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7$~GeV, we demonstrate that the electromagnetic
interaction between spectator charges and final state pions results in charge
splitting of positive and negative pion directed flow. Such a charge splitting
is visible in the experimental data reported by the STAR Collaboration.
  The magnitude of this charge splitting appears to strongly depend on the
actual distance between the pion emission site (pion at freeze-out) and the
spectator system. As such, the above electromagnetic effect brings new,
independent information on the space-time evolution of pion production in heavy
ion collisions.
  From the comparison of our present analysis to our earlier studies made for
pions produced at higher rapidity, we formulate conclusions on the rapidity
dependence of the distance between the pion emission site and the spectator
system. This distance appears to decrease with increasing pion rapidity,
reflecting the longitudinal expansion of the strongly-interacting system
responsible for pion emission. Thus for the first time, information on the
space-time characteristics of the system is being provided by means of the
spectator-induced electromagnetic interaction.
  The above electromagnetic effect being in fact a straight-forward consequence
of the presence of spectator charges in the collision, we consider that it
should be considered as a baseline for studies of other phenomena, like those
related to the electric conductivity of the quark-gluon plasma.

which can take the system from a semiconducting state at ambient pressure to a

system: localized and itinerant. An effective Falicov-Kimball model could then
possibly explain the observed insulator to metal transition. Comparison of the

graph to a simpler genealogical process which exposes the leading dynamics of
the former. We further demonstrate that when we consider the sampling

distribution function of high-energy particles in the wind collision region -

present the computation of the three-dimensional nonthermal photon emission for
a given line of sight. Anisotropic inverse Compton emission is modelled using
the target radiation field of both stars. Photons from relativistic
bremsstrahlung and neutral pion decay are computed on the basis of local wind
plasma densities. We also consider photon photon opacity effects due to the
dense radiation fields of the stars. Results are shown for different stellar
separations of a given binary system comprising of a B star and a Wolf-Rayet
star. The influence of orbital orientation with respect to the line of sight is
also studied by using different orbital viewing angles. For the chosen
electron-proton injection ratio of 0.01, we present the ensuing photon emission
in terms of two-dimensional projections maps, spectral energy distributions and
integrated photon flux values in various energy bands. Here, we find a
transition from hadron-dominated to lepton-dominated high-energy emission with
increasing stellar separations. In addition, we confirm findings from previous

large flares. These flares were observed to produce significant hardening of
the X-ray spectra during their very initial stages. We monitored flare-related
effects using the Suzaku X-ray satellite and the Australia Telescope Compact
Array at 3.6 and 6 cm. Observations at 11 and 21 cm were also included, but
they were compromised by interference. From our multiwavelength coverage we
find that the observed effects can be mainly associated with a large active
region near longitude zero. The second major X-ray and microwave flare of Jan
8, 2007 was observed with a favourable geometry that allowed its initial
high-energy impulsive phase to be observed in the higher frequency range of
Suzaku's XIS detectors. The fractional circular polarisation was measured for
the complete runs, for 25 min integrations and, at 4.80 GHz, for 5 min
integrations. Most of the full data sets showed circular polarisation fractions
from AB Dor B that were significant at greater than the 3 sigma level. In
several of the 5 min integrations at 4.80 and 8.64 GHz this fraction reached a
significance level between 3 and 9 sigma. Lack of angular resolution prevented
identification of these high V/I values with one or other of the two low-mass
red-dwarf components of AB Dor B.

the nature of its phase transition. A particular instance of this phenomenon is
the so-called rounding effect: it has been shown in many cases that the
free-energy curve of the disordered system at its critical point is smoother
than that of the homogenous one. In particular some disordered systems do not
allow first-order transitions. We study this phenomenon for the pinning of a
renewal with stretched-exponential tails on a defect line (the distribution $K$

$\alpha\in (0,1)$) which has a first order transition when disorder is not

the value of $\alpha$: when $\alpha>1/2$ the transition remains first order,

show that the rounding effect is getting stronger when $\alpha$ diminishes.

implementing the detected diffusion mechanisms into a dynamical agent-based

Classical TCM uses a signal constellation of twice the cardinality compared to
an uncoded transmission with one bit of redundancy per PAM symbol, i.e.,
application of codes with rates $\frac{n-1}{n}$ when $2^{n}$ denotes the
cardinality of the signal constellation.
  Recently published work allows rate adjustment for TCM by means of puncturing

(at least two) different types of points in dependence on how many lines of
either kind pass through each of them. In order to account for such partition

identical with a particular $(21_5,35_3)$-configuration that can be viewed as
four triangles in perspective from a line where the points of perspectivity of
six pairs of them form a Pasch configuration. We also draw attention to a
remarkable nesting pattern formed by these configurations, where ${\cal

Our focus is on how to best code, or characterize, the effects of the
variables, either alone or in combination with others. We consider simple
graphical techniques that not only provide an immediate indication as to the
goodness of fit but, in cases of departure from model assumptions, point in the
direction of a more involved alternative model. These techniques help support
our intuition. This intuition is backed up by formal theorems that underlie the
process of building richer models from simpler ones. Goodness-of-fit techniques
are used alongside measures of predictive strength and, again, formal theorems
show that these measures can be used to help identify models closest to the
unknown non-proportional hazards mechanism that we can suppose generates the
observations. We consider many examples and show how these tools can be of help

the temperature decreases to several 10 K and the characteristic stellar mass
decreases to $\sim 10\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$, in contrast with first stars formed
from undisturbed pristine clouds ($\sim 100\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$). However,
without CR irradiation, even weak far ultra-violet (FUV) irradiation suppresses
HD formation/cooling. Here, we examine conditions for HD cooling in primordial
clouds including both FUV and CR feedback. At the beginning of collapse, the
shock-compressed gas cools with its density increasing, while the relic HII
region gas cools at a constant density. Moreover, shocks tend to occur in
denser environments than HII regions. Owing to the higher column density and
the more effective shielding, the critical FUV intensity for HD cooling in a
shock-compressed gas becomes $\sim 10$ times higher than in relic HII regions.
Consequently, in the shock-compressed gas, the critical FUV intensity exceeds
the background level for most of the redshift we consider ($6 \lesssim z
\lesssim 15$), while in relic HII regions, HD cooling becomes effective after
the CR intensity increases enough at $z \lesssim 10$. Our result suggests that
less massive ($\sim 10\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$) Pop III stars may be more common than
previously considered and could be the dominant population of Pop III stars.

limited only by considerations of potential numerical instability. The
algorithm terminates when further reduction in the infeasibility index is not

Each permutation $x$ has a canonical join representation: a unique lowest set
of permutations joining to $x$. The second problem is to determine which sets
of permutations appear as canonical join representations. The two problems turn
out to be closely related because the noncrossing arc diagrams provide a
combinatorial model for canonical join representations. The same considerations

  Symposium on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we introduce the general concept of coded power control (CPC)
in a particular setting of the interference channel. Roughly, the idea of CPC
consists in embedding information (about a random state) into the transmit
power levels themselves: in this new framework, provided the power levels of a
given transmitter can be observed (through a noisy channels) by other
transmitters, a sequence of power levels of the former can therefore be used to
coordinate the latter. To assess the limiting performance of CPC (and therefore
the potential performance brought by this new approach), we derive, as a first
step towards many extensions of the present work, a general result which not
only concerns power control (PC) but also any scenario involving two
decision-makers (DMs) which communicate through their actions and have the
following information and decision structures. We assume that the DMs want to
maximize the average of an arbitrarily chosen instantaneous payoff function
which depends on the DMs' actions and the state realization. DM 1 is assumed to
know non-causally the state (e.g., the channel state) which affects the common
payoff while the other, say DM 2, has only a strictly causal knowledge of it.
DM 1 can only use its own actions (e.g., power levels) to inform DM 2 about its
best action in terms of payoff. Importantly, DM 2 can only monitor the actions
of DM 1 imperfectly and DM 1 does not observe DM 2. The latter assumption leads
us to exploiting Shannon-theoretic tools in order to generalize an existing
theorem which provides the information constraint under which the payoff is
maximized. The derived result is then exploited to fully characterize the
performance of good CPC policies for a given instance of the interference
channel.

creating an interference to an ongoing attack of a Dolev-Yao attacker, by means
of non-collaboration actuated by ad-hoc benign attackers that play the role of

runtime, through particular types of inference, whether an attack is ongoing,
interrupting the run of the protocol in the positive case. We study not only

vigorous star formation. We estimate synchrotron spectral index after

matter (DM). Following Barger et al, we consider 3 simple scenarios of DM that
annihilates into Standard Model (SM) fermion pairs. Scenario 1 is a Majorana DM
candidate coupled to a charged scalar, scenario 2 is a Majorana DM coupled to a
charged gauge boson and scenario 3 is a real scalar DM coupled a charged
vector-like fermion. As shown by Barger et al, these 3 scenarios share
precisely the same internal Bremsstrahlung spectral signature into gamma rays.
Their phenomenology is however distinct. In particular for annihilation into
light SM fermions, in the chiral limit, the 2-body annihilation cross section
is p-wave suppressed for the Majorana candidates while it is d-wave suppressed
for the real scalar. In the present work we study the annihilation into 2

  Measures",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the success of the popular kernelized support vector machines, they
have two major limitations: they are restricted to Positive Semi-Definite (PSD)
kernels, and their training complexity scales at least quadratically with the
size of the data. Many natural measures of similarity between pairs of samples
are not PSD e.g. invariant kernels, and those that are implicitly or explicitly
defined by latent variable models. In this paper, we investigate scalable
approaches for using indefinite similarity measures in large margin frameworks.
In particular we show that a normalization of similarity to a subset of the
data points constitutes a representation suitable for linear classifiers. The
result is a classifier which is competitive to kernelized SVM in terms of
accuracy, despite having better training and test time complexities.
Experimental results demonstrate that on CIFAR-10 dataset, the model equipped
with similarity measures invariant to rigid and non-rigid deformations, can be
made more than 5 times sparser while being more accurate than kernelized SVM
using RBF kernels.

a convex polytope $P$ that 1-tiles $\mathbb R^d$ with a discrete multiset

if a polytope $P$ $k$-tiles $\mathbb R^d$ with a discrete multiset $\Lambda$,

$m$-tiles $\mathbb R^d$ with a lattice $\mathcal L$ for some $m$. This
strengthens the results of Gravin, Kolountzakis, Robins, and Shiryaev, and is a

enable us to confidently use data over a larger interval with respect to the
usual Taylor series. To show this property in detail, we propose several Pad\'e
expansions and we compare these approximations with cosmic data, thus obtaining
cosmographic bounds from the observable universe for all cases. In particular,
we fit Pad\'e luminosity distances with observational data from different
uncorrelated surveys. We employ union 2.1 supernova data, baryonic acoustic
oscillation, Hubble space telescope measurements and differential age data. In
so doing, we also demonstrate that the use of Pad\'e approximants can improve
the analyses carried out by introducing cosmographic auxiliary variables, i.e.
a standard technique usually employed in cosmography in order to overcome the
divergence problem. Moreover, for any drawback related to standard cosmography,
we emphasize possible resolutions in the framework of Pad\'e approximants. In
particular, we investigate how to reduce systematics, how to overcome the
degeneracy between cosmological coefficients, how to treat divergences and so
forth. As a result, we show that cosmic bounds are actually refined through the
use of Pad\'e treatments and the thus derived best values of the cosmographic
parameters show slight departures from the standard cosmological paradigm.
Although all our results are perfectly consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model,
evolving dark energy components different from a pure cosmological constant are

one observes qualitatively different dynamical properties, such as rapid

had predicted the Higgs boson mass to be of about $126\pm 3$ GeV, which has
been confirmed by the LHC, and that a possibly measurable amount of gravity
waves should be produced. Using more refined recent theoretical calculations of
the RGE we show that such scenario has the right scale of Inflation only for
small Higgs mass, lower than about 124 GeV, otherwise gravity waves are
overproduced. The precise value is subject to some theoretical error and to
experimental errors on the determination of the strong coupling constant. Such
an upper bound corresponds also to the recent claimed measurement by BICEP2 of
the scale of inflation through primordial tensor modes. Finally we show that
introducing a moderately large non-minimal coupling for the Higgs field the
bound can shift to larger values and be reconciled with the LHC measurements of

plantation in the Philippines. We used allometry in expressing the mangrove
growth equation, and stochasticity in scheduling population-level events that
drive the development of the mangrove forest. Analysis of the model unveils an
index, $\xi$, that could be used in assessing a strategy which could promote
optimum carbon-stock accumulation in the long run. If initial plot is
configured such that $\xi > 1$, the $R.\; mucronata$ plantations could achieve
an above-ground biomass per hectare (AGB) of $1000\mbox{ t/ha}$, or about
$500\mbox{ tC/ha}$, in approximately $200$ to $250$ years post planting. In
contrast, the current restoration strategy implemented in the Philippines
corresponds to the case that $\xi <1$. Consequently, the restored mangroves
could not achieve stable growth without the support of costly human assistance
such as frequent replanting. Rather, through that typical strategy and in the
absence of assistance, the AGB decreases with time until all trees die.
Mangrove restoration could therefore be planned strategically to mitigate
costly and wasteful implementation. The proposed index $\xi$ thus serves as an
early indicator for the progress or demise of restored mangroves.

evolves into another gapless state, providing bulk evidence of unconventional

of the superconducting gap can be controlled by disorder, which is a strikingly
unique feature of iron pnictides.

multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems in Ricean fading channels, using
maximal-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers, assuming perfect
and imperfect channel state information (CSI). In contrast to previous relevant
works, the fast fading MIMO channel matrix is assumed to have an arbitrary-rank
deterministic component as well as a Rayleigh-distributed random component. We
derive tractable expressions for the achievable uplink rate in the
large-antenna limit, along with approximating results that hold for any finite
number of antennas. Based on these analytical results, we obtain the scaling
law that the users' transmit power should satisfy, while maintaining a
desirable quality of service. In particular, it is found that regardless of the
Ricean $K$-factor, in the case of perfect CSI, the approximations converge to
the same constant value as the exact results, as the number of base station
antennas, $M$, grows large, while the transmit power of each user can be scaled
down proportionally to $1/M$. If CSI is estimated with uncertainty, the same
result holds true but only when the Ricean $K$-factor is non-zero. Otherwise,
if the channel experiences Rayleigh fading, we can only cut the transmit power
of each user proportionally to $1/\sqrt M$. In addition, we show that with an
increasing Ricean $K$-factor, the uplink rates will converge to fixed values
for both MRC and ZF receivers.

  by mechanical motion","13 pages, 1 figure",,,,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this study the power flow in a coupled mechanical and electromagnetic
harvesting system in presence of both positional and electrical fluctuations is
analyzed. Explicit expressions for the power into and out of the mechanical and
electrical parts of the system are found in the case of weak coupling, and it
is shown how the power flows between the domains consistent with energy
conservation. The case of thermal fluctuations is considered in particular, and
use of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem explicitly demonstrates that the
power delivered to the mechanical system from the electrical system is the same
as the power delivered to the electrical system from the mechanical system. On
the other hand, the power dissipated in the electrical circuit is not the same
as the power transferred from the mechanical domain if the electrical circuit
contains its own current fluctuations. The electrical noise power dissipated in
a load resistor is calculated, and found to consist of a component due to
electromagnetic coupling in addition to the well-known Nyquist component. The
component due to electromagnetic coupling scales with size, and becomes more
important than the Nyquist component only for sufficiently small systems.

duality gap between the primal and dual problems under some conditions by using
the classical Lagrangian duality. A benchmark generator is given to create
random BQP problems which can be solved in polynomial time. Several numerical
examples are generated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

this paper, we discuss about admissibility of arithmetic integer additive
set-indexers by certain graph operations and certain products of graphs.
