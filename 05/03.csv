objective was a very accurate measurement of the temperature anisotropies of
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We announced our findings a few months
ago, on March 21$^{st}$, 2013. I describe some of the relevant steps we took to
obtain these results, sketching the measurement process, how we processed the
data to obtain full sky maps at 9 different frequencies, and how we extracted
the CMB temperature anisotropies map and angular power spectrum. I conclude by
describing some of the main cosmological implications of the statistical
characteristics of the CMB we found. Of course, this is a very much shortened

By using scaling arguments, we argue that a four-point correlation length
$\xi_4(t)$ grows linearly in time in a glass and grows as $\sqrt{t}$ at long
times in a fluid, and we verify these results by analyzing $S_4(q;t)$ obtained
from simulations. For a viscoelastic fluid, the simulation results suggest that
the crossover to the long-time $\sqrt{t}$ growth of $\xi_4(t)$ occurs at a

little known that, mathematically, they are one and the same. This knowledge
helps us to understand either from the viewpoint of the other. Here we show
that all general time-dependent solutions of the free-particle Schroedinger
equation can be mapped to solutions of the Schroedinger equation for harmonic
potentials, both the trapping oscillator and the inverted 'oscillator'. This
map is fully invertible and therefore induces an isomorphism between both types
of system, they are equivalent. A composition of the map and its inverse allows
us to map from one harmonic oscillator to another with a different spring
constant and different center position. The map is independent of the state of
the system, consisting only of a coordinate transformation and multiplication
by a form factor, and can be chosen such that the state is identical in both
systems at one point in time. This transition point in time can be chosen
freely, the wave function of the particle evolving in time in one system before
the transition point can therefore be linked up smoothly with the wave function
for the other system and its future evolution after the transition point. Such
a cut-and-paste procedure allows us to describe the instantaneous changes of

states in two dimensions possessing the simplest descriptions in terms of

frustration-free, and gapless. It can be interpreted as describing a quantum
phase transition between different topological phases. The second one,
$\mathcal H_\mathrm{fb}$ is gapped, and has hopping terms scaling as $1/r^3$
with the distance $r$. The gap is robust against local perturbations, which
allows us to define a Chern number for the PEPS. As for (non-chiral)
topological PEPS, the non-trivial topological properties can be traced down to
the existence of a symmetry in the virtual modes that are used to build the
state. Based on that symmetry, we construct string-like operators acting on the
virtual modes that can be continuously deformed without changing the state. On
the torus, the symmetry implies that the ground state space of the local parent
Hamiltonian is two-fold degenerate. By adding a string wrapping around the
torus one can change one of the ground states into the other. We use the
special properties of PEPS to build the boundary theory and show how the
symmetry results in the appearance of chiral modes, and a universal correction

basically assumes that similar rainfall intensity values and their spectral
radiances live close to some sufficiently smooth manifolds with analogous local
geometry. The detection step employs a nearest neighborhood classification
rule, while the estimation scheme is equipped with a constrained shrinkage
estimator to ensure stability of retrieval and some physical consistency. The
algorithm is examined using coincidental observations of the active

results of instantaneous rainfall retrieval for some tropical storms and
mesoscale convective systems over ocean, land, and coastal zones. We provide

\emph{epidemic survivability} ($ES$), a new network measure that describes the
vulnerability of each node of a network under a specific epidemic intensity.
Secondly, we propose \emph{cascading survivability} ($CS$), which characterizes
how potentially injurious a node is according to a cascading failure scenario.
Then, we show that by using the distribution of values obtained from $ES$ and

Conjecture.
  In this paper we consider a generalization of MAS, the Restricted Maximum
Acyclic Subgraph problem (RMAS), where each node is associated with a list of
integer labels, and we have to find a labeling of the nodes so as to maximize
the weight of edges whose head label is larger than the tail label. The best
known (almost trivial) approximation for RMAS is 4.
  The interest of RMAS is mostly due to its connections with the Vertex Pricing
problem (VP). In VP we are given an undirected graph with positive edge
budgets. A feasible solution consists of an assignment of non-negative prices
to the nodes. The profit for each edge $e$ is the sum of its endpoints prices
if that sum is at most the budget of $e$, and zero otherwise. Our goal is to
maximize the total profit. The best known approximation for VP, which works
analogously to the mentioned approximation algorithm for RMAS, is 4. Improving
on that is a challenging open problem. On the other hand, the best known 2
inapproximability result is due to a reduction from a special case of RMAS.
  In this paper we present an improved LP-rounding $2\sqrt{2}$ approximation
for RMAS. Our result shows that, in order to prove a 4 hardness of
approximation result for VP (if possible), one should consider reductions from
harder problems. Alternatively, our approach might suggest a different way to

possibility that one could clarify the source of this ""supernova rate problem""
by detecting the energy spectrum of supernova relic neutrinos with a next
generation detector like Hyper-Kamiokande. We make an alternative compilation
of the SFR data. We show that by only including published SFR data for which
the dust obscuration has been directly determined, the ratio of the observed
massive SFR to the observed supernova rate has large uncertainties$\sim
1.8^{+1.6}_{-0.6}$, and is statistically consistent with no supernova rate
problem. If we consider that a significant fraction of massive stars end their
lives as faint ONeMg SNe or as failed SNe, then the ratio reduces to $\sim
1.1^{+1.0}_{-0.4}$ and the rate problem is solved. We study the sources of
uncertainty involved in estimates of the neutrino detection rate and analyze
whether the spectrum of relic neutrinos can be used to independently identify
the existence of a supernova rate problem and its source. We consider an
ensemble of published and unpublished neutrino luminosities and temperatures
from core collapse supernova simulation models. We illustrate how the spectrum
of detector events might be used to constrain the average neutrino temperature

neutrino spectrum and also analyze a possible enhanced contribution from failed

inequality $EVI_k$ which in turn extends the $EVI_K$-inequality of
Ambrosio-Gigli-Savar\'e; ii) its stability under convergence and its
local-to-global property.
  For metric measure spaces with uniform lower curvature bounds $K$ we prove
that for each pair of initial distributions $\mu_1,\mu_2$ on $X$ there exists a
coupling $B_t=(B_t^1,B_t^2)$, $t\ge0$, of two Brownian motions on $X$ with the
given initial distributions such that a.s. for all $s,t\ge0$

below the knee, possibly even up to the ankle, i.e. up to energies of 1e15 eV
or 1e18.5 eV, respectively. In particular, Supernova Remnants are discussed as
one of the main candidates to explain the cosmic ray spectrum. Even before
their violent deaths, during the stars' regular life times, cosmic rays can be
accelerated in wind environments. High-energy gamma-ray measurements indicate
hadronic acceleration binary systems, leading to both periodic gamma-ray
emission from binaries like LSI+60~303 and continuous emission from colliding
wind environments like Eta Carinae. The detection of neutrinos and photons from
hadronic interactions are one of the most promising methods to identify
particle acceleration sites. In this paper, future prospects to detect
neutrinos from colliding wind environments in massive stars are investigated.
In particular, the seven most promising candidates for emission from colliding
wind binaries are investigated to provide an estimate of the signal strength.
The expected signal of a single source is about a factor of $5-10$ below the
current IceCube sensitivity and it is therefore not accessible at the moment.
What is discussed in addition is future the possibility to measure low-energy
neutrino sources with detectors like PINGU and ORCA: the minimum of the
atmospheric neutrino flux at around 25 GeV from neutrino oscillations provides
an opportunity to reduce the background and increase the significance to
searches for GeV/TeV neutrino sources. This paper presents the first idea,
detailed studies including the detector's effective areas will be necessary in
the future to test the feasibility of such an approach.

can mitigate decoherence, but generally increase experimental complexity. Here
we improve coherence in a qubit using real-time Hamiltonian parameter
estimation. Using a rapidly converging Bayesian approach, we precisely measure
the splitting in a singlet-triplet spin qubit faster than the surrounding
nuclear bath fluctuates. We continuously adjust qubit control parameters based
on this information, thereby improving the inhomogenously broadened coherence
time ($T_{2}^{*}$) from tens of nanoseconds to above 2 $\mu$s and demonstrating
the effectiveness of Hamiltonian estimation in reducing the effects of
correlated noise in quantum systems. Because the technique demonstrated here is
compatible with arbitrary qubit operations, it is a natural complement to
quantum error correction and can be used to improve the performance of a wide
variety of qubits in both metrological and quantum-information-processing
applications.

been observed with the H.E.S.S. imaging air Cherenkov telescope array,
sensitive to gamma radiation in the very-high-energy (VHE, $>100$ GeV) regime.
Due to its relatively small redshift of $z\sim0.5$, the favourable position in
the southern sky and the relatively short follow-up time ($<700 \rm{s}$ after
the satellite trigger) of the H.E.S.S. observations, this GRB could be within
the sensitivity reach of the H.E.S.S. instrument. The analysis of the H.E.S.S.

spectral-temporal model, normalised to the prompt flux at sub-MeV energies,

comparison between the H.E.S.S. upper limit and the contemporaneous energy
output in X-rays constrains the ratio between the X-ray and VHE gamma-ray

modelling the afterglow and can constrain leptonic emission scenarios, where

galaxy sub-samples and infer the properties of their hosting halos using both
an HOD model and the linear bias at large scale. We find that passive and
star-forming galaxies obey a similarly rising relation between the halo and
stellar mass. The mean host halo mass of star forming galaxies increases with
the star formation rate between 30 and 200 M$_\odot$.yr$^{-1}$, but flattens
for higher values, except if we select only main-sequence galaxies. This
reflects the expected transition from a regime of secular co-evolution of the
halos and the galaxies to a regime of episodic starburst. We find similar large
scale biases for main-sequence, passive, and starburst galaxies at equal
stellar mass, suggesting that these populations live in halos of the same mass.
We detect an excess of clustering on small scales for passive galaxies and
showed, by measuring the large-scale bias of close pairs, that this excess is
caused by a small fraction ($\sim16%$) of passive galaxies being hosted by
massive halos ($\sim 3 \times 10^{13}$ M$_\odot$) as satellites. Finally,
extrapolating the growth of halos hosting the z$\sim$2 population, we show that
M$_\star \sim 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ galaxies at z$\sim$2 will evolve, on average,
into massive (M$_\star \sim 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$), field galaxies in the local

model was proposed, as a potential candidate for resolving the hierarchy
problem, by minimally introducing a complex gauge singlet scalar, and
generating radiative electroweak symmetry breaking by means of the Coleman-
Weinberg Mechanism. Postulating the singlet sector to respect the CP-symmetry,
the existence of a stable pseudoscalar dark matter candidate with a mass in the
TeV range was demonstrated. More- over, the model predicted the presence of
another physical CP-even Higgs boson (with suppressed tree-level couplings), in
addition to the 125 GeV scalar discovered by the LHC. The viable region of the
parameter space was determined by various theoretical and experimental
considerations. In this work, we continue to examine the phenomenological
implications of the proposed minimal sce- nario by considering the constraints
from the dark matter relic density, as determined by the Planck collaboration,
as well as the direct detection bounds from the LUX experiment. Furthermore, we
investigate the implications of the collider Higgs searches for the additional

anisotropy (PMCA), whose energy, $E_{MCA}$, is as large as 150 $\mu$eV/atom,
two orders of magnitude greater than those of 3$d$ magnetic metals. Further
investigation over the range of tetragonal distortion suggests that the
appearance of the magnetism in the {\em bct}--Ru is governed by the Jahn-Teller
spit $e_g$ orbitals. Moreover, from band analysis, MCA is mainly determined by
an interplay between two $e_g$ states, $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ states, as a
result of level reversal associated with tetragonal distortion.

we prove sufficient conditions for its applicability in the case of the

for M giants and the distance-colour relations, we derived the extinction as a
function of distance. The observed colours were shifted to match the intrinsic
colours in the Besan\c{c}on model as a function of distance iteratively. This
created an extinction map with three dimensions: two spatial and one distance
dimension along each line of sight towards the bulge. We present a 3D
extinction map that covers the whole VVV area with a resolution of 6' x 6',
using distance bins of 0.5 kpc. The high resolution and depth of the photometry
allows us to derive extinction maps for a range of distances up to 10 kpc and
up to 30 magnitudes of extinction in $A_{V}$. Integrated maps show the same
dust features and consistent values as other 2D maps. We discuss the spatial
distribution of dust features in the line of sight, which suggests that there
is much material in front of the Galactic bar, specifically between 5-7 kpc. We
compare our dust extinction map with high-resolution $\rm ^{12}CO$ maps towards
the Galactic bulge, where we find a good correlation between $\rm ^{12}CO$ and

of strong dsDNA bending constitutes an essential part of cellular
thermodynamics. Although the thermomechanical behavior of long dsDNA is well
described by the worm-like chain (WLC) model, the length limit of such elastic
behavior remains controversial. To investigate the energetics of strong dsDNA
bending, we measured the opening rate of small dsDNA loops with contour lengths
of 40-200 bp using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). From the
measured relationship of loop stability to loop size, we observed a transition
between two separate bending regimes at a critical loop size below 100 bp.
Above this loop size, the loop lifetime decreased with decreasing loop size in
a manner consistent with an elastic bending stress. Below the critical loop
size, however, the loop lifetime became less sensitive to loop size, indicative
of softening of the double helix. The critical loop size was measured to be ~60
bp with sodium only and ~100 bp with 5 mM magnesium, which suggests that
magnesium facilitates the softening transition. We show that our results are in
quantitative agreement with the kinkable worm-like chain model. Furthermore,
the model parameters constrained by our data can reproduce previously measured
J factors between 50 and 200 bp. Our work provides powerful means to study

outlined, based on novel analyses performed to quantify the evolution of cold
streams of a large sample of galaxies from a state-of-the-art ultra-high
resolution, large-scale adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic simulation in a
fully cosmological setting. It is found that the following three key physical
variables of galactic cold inflows crossing the virial sphere substantially
decrease with decreasing redshift: the number of streams N_{90} that make up
90% of concurrent inflow mass flux, average inflow rate per stream dot M_{90}
and mean (mass flux weighted) gas density in the streams n_{gas}. Another key
variable, the stream dimensionless angular momentum parameter lambda, instead
is found to increase with decreasing redshift. Assimilating these trends and
others leads naturally to a physically coherent scenario for the emergence of
the Hubble sequence, including the following expectations: (1) the predominance
of a mixture of disproportionately small irregular and complex disk galaxies at
z>2 when most galaxies have multiple concurrent streams, (2) the beginning of
the appearance of flocculent spirals at z~1-2 when the number of concurrent
streams are about 2-3, (3) the grand-design spiral galaxies appear at z<1 when
galaxies with only one major cold stream significantly emerge. These expected
general trends are in good accord with observations. Early type galaxies are
those that have entered a perennial state of zero cold gas stream, with their
abundance increasing with decreasing redshift.

endopeptidases associated with the accessory glands, suggesting that
duplications function in Red Queen dynamics and rapid evolution. We document
evidence of widespread selection on the D. simulans X, suggesting adaptation
through duplication is common on the X. Despite the evidence for positive
selection, duplicates display an excess of low frequency variants consistent
with largely detrimental impacts, limiting the variation that can effectively
facilitate adaptation. Although we observe hundreds of gene duplications, we
show that segregating variation is insufficient to provide duplicate copies of
the entire genome, and the number of duplications in the population spans
13.4\% of major chromosome arms in D. yakuba and 9.7\% in D. simulans. Whole
gene duplication rates are low at $1.17\times10^{-9}$ per gene per generation

suggesting long wait times for new mutations on the order of thousands of years
for the establishment of sweeps. Hence, in cases where adaption depends on
individual tandem duplications, evolution will be severely limited by mutation.
We observe low levels of parallel recruitment of the same duplicated gene in

gravity, since it is different from all the existing torsion or curvature based
constructions. Applied to a cosmological framework, it leads to interesting
phenomenology. In particular, one can obtain a unified description of the
initial inflationary phase, the subsequent non-accelerating, matter-dominated
expansion, and then the transition to a late-time accelerating phase.
Additionally, the effective dark energy sector can be quintessence or
phantom-like, or exhibit the phantom-divide crossing during the evolution.
Moreover, in the far future the universe results either to a de Sitter
exponential expansion, or to eternal power-law accelerated expansions. Finally,
a detailed study of the scalar perturbations at the linear level reveals that
$f(T,\mathcal{T})$ cosmology can be free of ghosts and instabilities for a wide
class of ansatzes and model parameters.

the coarse-grained probability density of finding a particle at a given
location and at a given time to arbitrary short time regimes. By going beyond
the diffusive limit, we derive a novel generalization of the telegrapher's
equation. Such generalization preserves the hyperbolic structure of the
equation and incorporates memory effects on the diffusive term. While no
difference is observed for the mean square displacement computed from the
two-dimensional telegrapher's equation and from our generalization, the
kurtosis results into a sensible parameter that discriminates between both
approximations. We carried out a comparative analysis in Fourier space that
shed light on why the telegrapher's equation is not an appropriate model to
describe the propagation of particles with constant speed in dispersive media.

renders optimal sensitivity for phase or amplitude modulation. Here we take a
different approach and apply the formalism of quantum information to
characterize how a phase modulator affects a general polarization state. In
this context, the spatial modulators can be exploited as a resource to couple
the polarization and the transverse spatial degrees of freedom. Using a
quasi-monochromatic single photon beam obtained from a pair of twin photons
generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion, we performed quantum
process tomography in order to obtain a general analytic model for a quantum
channel that describes the action of the device on the polarization qubits. We
illustrate the application of these concepts by demonstrating the
implementation of a controllable phase flip channel. This scheme can be applied
in a straightforward manner to characterize the resulting polarization states
of different types of phase or amplitude modulators and motivates the combined
use of polarization and spatial degrees of freedom in innovative applications.

to being... engineering mistakes which other crypto currencies have copied
rather blindly. More precisely we show that the capacity of current crypto
currencies to resist double spending attacks is poor and most current crypto
currencies are highly vulnerable. Satoshi did not implement a timestamp for
bitcoin transactions and the bitcoin software does not attempt to monitor
double spending events. As a result major attacks involving hundreds of
millions of dollars can occur and would not even be recorded. Hundreds of
millions have been invested to pay for ASIC hashing infrastructure yet
insufficient attention was paid to network neutrality and to insure that the
protection layer it promises is effective and cannot be abused. In this paper
we develop a theory of Programmed Self-Destruction of crypto currencies. We
observe that most crypto currencies have mandated abrupt and sudden
transitions. These affect their hash rate and therefore their protection
against double spending attacks which we do not limit the to the notion of 51%
attacks which is highly misleading. In addition we show that smaller bitcoin
competitors are substantially more vulnerable. In addition to small hash rate,
many bitcoin competitors mandate incredibly important adjustments in miner
reward. We exhibit examples of 'alt-coins' which validate our theory and for
which the process of programmed decline and rapid self-destruction has clearly

social network has been widely studied. Because it is NP-hard, some heuristics
were proposed to find sub-optimal solutions. Still, one of the commonly used
assumption is the one that seeds are chosen on the static network, not the
dynamic one. This static approach is in fact far from the real-world networks,
where new nodes may appear and old ones dynamically disappear in course of
time.
  The main purpose of this paper is to analyse how the results of one of the
typical models for spread of influence - linear threshold - differ depending on
the strategy of building the social network used later for choosing seeds. To
show the impact of network creation strategy on the final number of influenced
nodes - outcome of spread of influence, the results for three approaches were
studied: one static and two temporal with different granularities, i.e. various
number of time windows. Social networks for each time window encapsulated
dynamic changes in the network structure. Calculation of various node
structural measures like degree or betweenness respected these changes by means
of forgetting mechanism - more recent data had greater influence on node
measure values. These measures were, in turn, used for node ranking and their
selection for seeding.
  All concepts were applied to experimental verification on five real datasets.
The results revealed that temporal approach is always better than static and
the higher granularity in the temporal social network while seeding, the more
finally influenced nodes. Additionally, outdegree measure with exponential
forgetting typically outperformed other time-dependent structural measures, if
used for seed candidate ranking.

intergalactic medium is a critical ingredient in the theory of reionization. We
use two zoomed-in, high-resolution (4 pc), cosmological radiation hydrodynamic
simulations with adaptive mesh refinement to investigate the impact of two
physical mechanisms (supernova feedback and runaway OB stars) on the escape
fraction (f_esc) at the epoch of reionization (z>7). We implement a new,
physically motivated supernova feedback model that can approximate the Sedov
solutions at all (from the free expansion to snowplow) stages. We find that
there is a significant time delay of about ten million years between the peak
of star formation and that of escape fraction, due to the time required for the
build-up and subsequent destruction of the star-forming cloud by supernova
feedback. Consequently, the photon number-weighted mean escape fraction for
dwarf galaxies in halos of mass 10^8-10^10.5 Msun is found to be <fesc>~11%,
although instantaneous values of f_esc>20% are common when star formation is
strongly modulated by the supernova explosions. We find that the inclusion of
runaway OB stars increases the mean escape fraction by 22% to <fesc>~14%. As
supernovae resulting from runaway OB stars tend to occur in less dense
environments, the feedback effect is enhanced and star formation is further
suppressed in halos with Mvir>10^9 Msun in the simulation with runaway OB stars
compared with the model without them. While both our models produce enough
ionizing photons to maintain a fully ionized universe at z>7 as observed, a
still higher amount of ionizing photons at z>9 appears necessary to accommodate
the high observed electron optical depth inferred from cosmic microwave
background observations.

electrons near the shock transition zone are assumed to have the so-called
$\kappa$-distributions produced by interactions of background thermal particles
with pre-existing and/or self-excited plasma/MHD waves or turbulence. The
$\kappa$-distribution has a power-law tail, instead of an exponential cutoff,
well above the thermal peak momentum. So there are a larger number of potential
seed particles with momentum, above that required for participation in the DSA
process. As a result, the injection fraction for the $\kappa$-distribution
depends on the shock Mach number much less severely compared to that for the
Maxwellian distribution. Thus, the existence of $\kappa$-like suprathermal
tails at shocks would ease the problem of extremely low injection fractions,
especially for electrons and especially at weak shocks such as those found in
the intracluster medium. We suggest that the injection fraction for protons
ranges $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ for a $\kappa$-distribution with $10 < \kappa_p < 30$
at quasi-parallel shocks, while the injection fraction for electrons becomes
$10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ for a $\kappa$-distribution with $\kappa_e < 2$ at
quasi-perpendicular shocks. For such $\kappa$ values the ratio of cosmic ray
electrons to protons naturally becomes $K_{e/p}\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$, which is

finite automaton (SFA) for efficient parallel computation of an automaton. The
key idea is to extend an automaton so that it involves the simulation of
transitions. Since an SFA itself has a good property of parallelism, we can
develop easily a parallel implementation without overheads. We have implemented
a regular expression matcher based on SFA, and it has achieved over 10-times
speedups on an environment with dual hexa-core CPUs in a typical case.

the 3D BEC scenario at $T<1$ K only due to a pronounced anisotropy of the

utilize the Hubble constant direct measurement data, the Planck

cosmic shear data. We find that due to the fact that the BICEP2 data are most
sensitive to the multipole $\ell\sim150$ corresponding to $k\sim0.01$
Mpc$^{-1}$, there exists a strong anticorrelation between $n_t$ and $r_{0.002}$

correlations between time-series of mesoscopic electric potential dynamics,
which allows the construction of a graph where each node represents one
time-series. The spatial neural network model is central in this study in the

Classic decision theory transforms money into utility through a utility

changes. Utility functions aim to capture individual psychological
characteristics, but their generality limits predictive power. Expectation
value maximizers are defined as rational in economics, but expectation values
are only meaningful in the presence of ensembles or in systems with ergodic
properties, whereas decision-makers have no access to ensembles and the
variables representing wealth in the usual growth models do not have the
relevant ergodic properties. Simultaneously addressing the shortcomings of
utility and those of expectations, we propose to evaluate gambles by averaging
wealth growth over time. No utility function is needed, but a dynamic must be
specified to compute time averages. Linear and logarithmic ""utility functions""
appear as transformations that generate ergodic observables for purely additive
and purely multiplicative dynamics, respectively. We highlight inconsistencies
throughout the development of decision theory, whose correction clarifies that
our perspective is legitimate. These invalidate a commonly cited argument for
bounded utility functions.

wave dynamics in ABC magnetic field via direct 3D MHD numerical simulation is
studied for the first time. Gaussian AW pulse with length-scale much shorter
than ABC domain length and harmonic AW with wavelength equal to ABC domain
length are studied for four different resistivities. While it is found that AWs
dissipate quickly in the ABC field, surprisingly, AW perturbation energy
increases in time. In the case of the harmonic AW perturbation energy growth is
transient in time, attaining peaks in both velocity and magnetic perturbation
energies within timescales much smaller than resistive time. In the case of the
Gaussian AW pulse velocity perturbation energy growth is still transient in
time, attaining a peak within few resistive times, while magnetic perturbation
energy continues to grow. It is also shown that the total magnetic energy
decreases in time and this is governed by the resistive evolution of the
background ABC magnetic field rather than AW damping. On contrary, when
background magnetic field is uniform, the total magnetic energy decrease is
prescribed by AW damping, because there is no resistive evolution of the
background. By considering runs with different amplitudes and by analysing
perturbation spectra, possible dynamo action by AW perturbation-induced
peristaltic flow and inverse cascade of magnetic energy have been excluded.
Therefore, the perturbation energy growth is attributed to a new instability.
The growth rate appears to be dependent on the value of the resistivity and
spatial scale of the AW disturbance. Thus, when going beyond WKB approximation,
AW damping, described by full MHD equations, does not guarantee decrease of
perturbation energy.

reversal by excitation with sub-100 ps long orthogonal monopolar magnetic pulse
sequences is possible in a wide range of pulse lengths and amplitudes. The

Second, in the setting of batch learning, we introduce a sufficient condition

functions are used: a common practice in many learning to rank algorithms. En
route to developing the online algorithm and generalization bound, we propose a

surrogate and is distinct from the listwise large margin surrogates developed

the imposed sink deadline along with the interference constraint hinders

aggregation determines the quality of aggregation ($QoA$). Although the
previous studies have proposed optimal algorithms to maximize $QoA$ under an
imposed deadline and a given aggregation tree, there is no work on constructing
optimal tree in this context. In this paper, we cast an optimization problem to
address optimal tree construction for deadline-constrained data aggregation in

structure from motion) are solved with nonlinear optimization methods. It is
generally accepted that second order descent methods are the most robust, fast,
and reliable approaches for nonlinear optimization of a general smooth
function. However, in the context of computer vision, second order descent
methods have two main drawbacks: (1) the function might not be analytically
differentiable and numerical approximations are impractical, and (2) the
Hessian may be large and not positive definite. To address these issues, this
paper proposes generic descent maps, which are average ""descent directions"" and
rescaling factors learned in a supervised fashion. Using generic descent maps,
we derive a practical algorithm - Supervised Descent Method (SDM) - for
minimizing Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) problems. During training, SDM learns
a sequence of decent maps that minimize the NLS. In testing, SDM minimizes the
NLS objective using the learned descent maps without computing the Jacobian or
the Hessian. We prove the conditions under which the SDM is guaranteed to
converge. We illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of SDM in three computer
vision problems: rigid image alignment, non-rigid image alignment, and 3D pose
estimation. In particular, we show how SDM achieves state-of-the-art

practices, yields, and environmental data sources. Associations between these
different variables can be obtained by applying machine learning algorithms to
historical data. In this paper we present applications of different machine
learning algorithms in aquaculture applications.

  Algorithm",,,,,"cs.NE cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) have a role of identifying
malicious activities by monitoring the behavior of networks. Due to the
currently high volume of networks trafic in addition to the increased number of
attacks and their dynamic properties, NIDSs have the challenge of improving
their classification performance. Bio-Inspired Optimization Algorithms (BIOs)
are used to automatically extract the the discrimination rules of normal or
abnormal behavior to improve the classification accuracy and the detection
ability of NIDS. A quantum vaccined immune clonal algorithm with the estimation
of distribution algorithm (QVICA-with EDA) is proposed in this paper to build a
new NIDS. The proposed algorithm is used as classification algorithm of the new
NIDS where it is trained and tested using the KDD data set. Also, the new NIDS
is compared with another detection system based on particle swarm optimization
(PSO). Results shows the ability of the proposed algorithm of achieving high
intrusions classification accuracy where the highest obtained accuracy is 94.8
%.

architecture. Although Java provides standard tools for tier-to-tier
interfaces, the separation of the tiers is usually not perfect. E.g. the
database interface, JDBC, assumes that SQL statements are issued from the
application server. Similarly, in web based Java applications, HTML code is
assumed to be produced by servlets. In terms of syntax, this turns Java source
code into mixtures of languages: Java and SQL, Java and HTML. These language
mixtures are difficult to read, modify, and maintain.
  In this paper we examine criteria and methods to achieve a good separation of
the 3 tiers and propose a technique to provide a clean separation. Our proposed
technique requires an explicit Interface and Data Definitions. These allow
isolation of the back-end, application server, and front-end development. The
Definitions also enable application design in terms of aggregated data
structures. As a result significant amounts of auxiliary code can be generated
from the Definitions, enabling the developers to concentrate on the business
logic. By and large the proposed approach greatly facilitates development and
maintenance, and overall improves the quality of the products.

$h=h^*(G)$ such that $F^*_h(G)=G$, where the $F^*_i(G)$ is the generalized
Fitting series: $F^*_1(G)=F^*(G)$ and $F^*_{i+1}(G)$ is the inverse image of
$F^*(G/F^*_{i}(G))$. It is proved that if $G$ admits a soluble group of
automorphisms $A$ of coprime order, then $h^*(G)$ is bounded in terms of $h^*
(C_G(A))$, where $C_G(A)$ is the fixed-point subgroup, and the number of prime
factors of $|A|$ counting multiplicities. The result follows from the special
case when $A=\langle\varphi\rangle$ is of prime order, where it is proved that
$F^*(C_G(\varphi ))\leqslant F^*_{9}(G)$.
  The nonsoluble length $\lambda (G)$ of a finite group $G$ is defined as the
minimum number of nonsoluble factors in a normal series each of whose factors
either is soluble or is a direct product of nonabelian simple groups. It is
proved that if $A$ is a group of automorphisms of $G$ of coprime order, then
$\lambda (G)$ is bounded in terms of $\lambda (C_G(A))$ and the number of prime

energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm to maximize each UE's energy
efficiency (EE) subject to its specific quality of service (QoS) and maximum
transmission power constraints. We model the resource allocation problem as a
noncooperative game, in which each player is self-interested and wants to
maximize its own EE. The formulated EE maximization problem is a non-convex
problem and is transformed into a convex optimization problem by exploiting the
properties of the nonlinear fractional programming. An iterative optimization
algorithm is proposed and verified through computer simulations.
