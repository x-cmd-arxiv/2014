Here we report an interesting property in Cd$_3$As$_2$ that was unpredicted,
namely a remarkable protection mechanism that strongly suppresses
back-scattering in zero $\bf H$. In single crystals, the protection results in
a very high mobility that exceeds $>10^7$ cm$^2$/Vs below 4 K. Suppression of
backscattering results in a transport lifetime 10$^4\times$ longer than the

how this may relate to changes to the Fermi surface induced by $\bf H$.

explored via particle-in-cell simulations in the limit of a strong ambient
guide field that self-consistently and simultaneously follow the motions of
protons and $\alpha$ particles. Heating parallel to the local magnetic field
during reconnection with a guide field is strongly reduced compared with the
reconnection of anti-parallel magnetic fields. The dominant heating of thermal
ions during guide field reconnection results from pickup behavior of ions
during their entry into reconnection exhausts and dominantly produces heating
perpendicular rather than parallel to the local magnetic field. Pickup behavior
requires that the ion transit time across the exhaust boundary (with a
transverse scale of the order of the ion sound Larmor radius) be short compared
with the ion cyclotron period. This translates into a threshold in the strength
of reconnecting magnetic field that favors the heating of ions with high
mass-to-charge. A simulation with a broad initial current layer produces a
reconnecting system in which the amplitude of the reconnecting magnetic field
just upstream of the dissipation region increases with time as reconnection
proceeds. The sharp onset of perpendicular heating when the pickup threshold is
crossed is documented. A comparison of the time variation of the parallel and
perpendicular ion heating with that predicted based on the strength of the
reconnecting field establishes the scaling of ion heating with ambient
parameters both below and above the pickup threshold. The relevance to
observations of ion heating in the solar corona is discussed.

into the gas-phase either through thermal desorption, when a newly formed star
heats the medium around it and completely evaporates the ices; or through
non-thermal desorption mechanisms, such as photodesorption, when a single
far-UV photon releases only a few molecules from the ices. The first one
dominates in hot cores, hot corinos and strongly UV-illuminated PDRs, while the
second one dominates in colder regions, such as low UV-field PDRs. This is the
case of the Horsehead were dust temperatures are ~20-30K, and therefore offers
a clean environment to investigate what is the role of photodesorption. We have
carried-out an unbiased spectral line survey at 3, 2 and 1mm with the IRAM-30m

Personalized medicine involves the systematic use of individual patient
characteristics to determine which treatment option is most likely to result in
a better outcome for the patient on average. Why is personalized medicine not
done more in practice? One of many reasons is because practitioners do not have
any easy way to holistically evaluate whether their personalization procedure
does better than the standard of care. Our software, ""Personalized Treatment
Evaluator"" (the R package PTE), provides inference for improvement
out-of-sample in many clinical scenarios. We also extend current methodology by
allowing evaluation of improvement in the case where the endpoint is binary or
survival. In the software, the practitioner inputs (1) data from a single-stage
randomized trial with one continuous, incidence or survival endpoint and (2) a
functional form of a model for the endpoint constructed from domain knowledge.
The bootstrap is then employed on data unseen during model fitting to provide
confidence intervals for the improvement for the average future patient
(assuming future patients are similar to the patients in the trial). One may
also test against a null scenario where the hypothesized personalization are
not more useful than a standard of care. We demonstrate our method's promise on
simulated data as well as on data from a randomized comparative trial
investigating two treatments for depression.

at grain boundaries. However, further improvements are difficult to achieve
because grain boundary scattering is poorly understood, with recent
experimental observations suggesting that the phonon transmissivity may depend
on phonon frequency rather than being constant as in the commonly used gray
model. Here, we examine the impact of frequency-dependent grain boundary
scattering in nanocrystalline silicon and silicon-germanium alloys in a
realistic 3D geometry using frequency-dependent variance-reduced Monte Carlo
simulations. We find that the grain boundary may not be as effective as
predicted by the gray model in scattering certain phonons, with a substantial

longer than the grain size. Our result will help guide the design of more
efficient thermoelectrics.

recent observations of Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies by the Planck

high level of accuracy that the primordial deuterium abundance can be inferred
with remarkable precision. For a given cosmological model, one can obtain
independent information on nuclear processes in the energy range relevant for
BBN, which determine the eventual ^2H/H yield. In particular, assuming the
standard cosmological model, we show that a combined analysis of Planck data
and of recent deuterium abundance measurements in metal-poor damped Lyman-alpha
systems provides independent information on the cross section of the radiative
capture reaction d(p,\gamma)^3He converting deuterium into helium.
Interestingly, the result is higher than the values suggested by a fit of
present experimental data in the BBN energy range (10 - 300 keV), whereas it is
in better agreement with ab initio theoretical calculations, based on models
for the nuclear electromagnetic current derived from realistic interactions.
Due to the correlation between the rate of the above nuclear process and the
effective number of neutrinos Neff, the same analysis points out a Neff>3 as
well. We show how this observation changes when assuming a non-minimal
cosmological scenario. We conclude that further data on the d(p,\gamma)^3He
cross section in the few hundred keV range, that can be collected by
experiments like LUNA, may either confirm the low value of this rate, or rather
give some hint in favour of next-to-minimal cosmological scenarios.

conjecture that $O(N)_{-k}\times O(N)_k$ Chern-Simons theory coupled to

the SL$(3,\mathbb{Z})$ generators $\mathsf{S}^{xyz}$ and $\mathsf{T}^{xy}$ in
terms of the gauge group $G$ and the 4-cocycle $\omega_4$. As we compactify one
of the spatial directions $z$ into a compact circle with a gauge flux $b$
inserted, we can use the generators $\mathsf{S}^{xy}$ and $\mathsf{T}^{xy}$ of
an SL$(2,\mathbb{Z})$ subgroup to study the dimensional reduction of the 3D
topological order $\mathcal{C}^{3\text{D}}$ to a direct sum of degenerate
states of 2D topological orders $\mathcal{C}_b^{2\text{D}}$ in different flux
$b$ sectors: $\mathcal{C}^{3\text{D}} = \oplus_b \mathcal{C}_b^{2\text{D}}$.
The 2D topological orders $\mathcal{C}_b^{2\text{D}}$ are described by 2D gauge
theories of the group $G$ twisted by the 3-cocycles $\omega_{3(b)}$,
dimensionally reduced from the 4-cocycle $\omega_4$. We show that the
SL$(2,\mathbb{Z})$ generators, $\mathsf{S}^{xy}$ and $\mathsf{T}^{xy}$, fully
encode a particular type of three-string braiding statistics with a pattern
that is the connected sum of two Hopf links. With certain 4-cocycle twists, we
discover that, by threading a third string through two-string unlink into
three-string Hopf-link configuration, Abelian two-string braiding statistics is
promoted to non-Abelian three-string braiding statistics.

the natural assisted supersymmetric (SUSY) hybrid model (""natural SUSY hybrid

the right values for the tensor spectrum as well as a spectral index of 0.96
with a decay constant smaller than the Planck scale, f \lesssim M_P. On the
other hand, the vacuum energy of 2 x 10^{16} GeV with 50 e-folds is provided by
the inflaton coming from the SUSY hybrid sector, avoiding the eta problem.
These are achieved by introducing both the U(1)_R and a shift symmetry, and
employing the minimal Kahler potential.

provide a basis for the physics obeyed by any such system. One axiom is that
the number N of distinguishable states a in the system obeys N=max. This
assumes that N is known as deterministic prior knowledge. However, most
observed systems suffer statistical fluctuations, for which N is therefore only
known approximately. Then what happens if the scope of the axiom N=max is
extended to include such observed systems? It is found that the state a of the
system must obey a principle of maximum Fisher information, I=I_{max}. This is
important because many physical laws have been derived, assuming as a working
hypothesis that I=I_{max}. These derivations include uses of the principle of
Extreme physical information (EPI). Examples of such derivations were of the De
Broglie wave hypothesis, quantum wave equations, Maxwell's equations, new laws
of biology (e.g. of Coulomb force-directed cell development, and of in situ
cancer growth), and new laws of economic fluctuation and investment. That the
principle I=I_{max} itself derives, from suitably extended Hardy axioms,
thereby eliminates its need to be assumed in these derivations. Thus, uses of
I=I_{max} and EPI express physics at its most fundamental level -- its
axiomatic basis in math.

of compact binaries. This model predicts an afterglow that bears the
characteristic signatures of a constant, low density medium, including a smooth
prompt-afterglow transition, and a simple temporal evolution. However, these
expectations are in conflict with observations for a non-negligible fraction of
sGRB afterglows. In particular, the onset of the afterglow phase for some of
these events appears to be delayed and, in addition, a few of them exhibit
late- time rapid fading in their lightcurves. We show that these peculiar
observations can be explained independently of ongoing central engine activity
if some sGRB progenitors are compact binaries hosting at least one pulsar. The
Poynting flux emanating from the pulsar companion can excavate a bow-shock
cavity surround- ing the binary. If this cavity is larger than the shock
deceleration length scale in the undisturbed interstellar medium, then the
onset of the afterglow will be delayed. Should the deceleration occur entirely
within the swept-up thin shell, a rapid fade in the lightcurve will ensue. We
identify two types of pulsar that can achieve the conditions necessary for
altering the afterglow: low field, long lived pulsars, and high field pulsars.
We find that a sizable fraction (~20-50%) of low field pulsars are likely to
reside in neutron star binaries based on observations, while their high field
counterparts are not. Hydrodynamical calculations motivated by this model are
shown to be in good agreement with observations of sGRB afterglow lightcurves.

direct flavour models with Majorana neutrinos using $\Delta(6n^2)$ groups as a
flavour group. In direct models, in which the flavour group is broken to a
$Z_2\times Z_2$ subgroup in the neutrino sector, mixing angles and Dirac CP
phase are purely predicted from symmetry. General predictions of direct models
with $\Delta(6n^2)$ flavour groups are that all mixing angles are fixed up to a
discrete choice and that the Dirac CP phase is $0$ or $\pi$; Furthermore, the
middle column of the mixing matrix is trimaximal which yields the sum rule
$\theta_{23}=45^\circ \mp \theta_{13}/\sqrt{2}$ depending on the Dirac phase.
These predictions of lepton mixing parameters are compatible with recent global
fit results or will be tested experimentally in the near future. It is the

and Schupp introduced generic computability, capturing the idea that an
algorithm might work correctly except for a vanishing fraction of cases.
However, we observe that their definition of a negligible set is not computably
invariant (and thus not well-defined on the 1-degrees), resulting in some
failures of intuition and a break with standard expectations in computability
theory.
  To strengthen their approach, we introduce a new notion of intrinsic
asymptotic density, with rich relations to both randomness and classical
computability theory. We then apply these ideas to propose alternative
foundations for further development in (intrinsic) generic computability.
  Toward these goals, we classify intrinsic density 0 as a new immunity
property, specifying its position in the standard hierarchy from immune to
cohesive for both general and $\Delta^0_2$ sets, and identify intrinsic density
$\frac{1}{2}$ as the stochasticity corresponding to permutation randomness. We
also prove that Rice's Theorem extends to all intrinsic variations of generic
computability, demonstrating in particular that no such notion considers
$\emptyset'$ to be ""computable"".

if energy conservation is obeyed, while the Eddington closure produces spurious
enhancements of both reflected light and thermal emission. We concoct recipes

space-time relay transmission. In the first step, different sets of users are
scheduled to send signals over networks and the remaining users and relays
overhear the transmitted signals, thereby learning the interference patterns.
In the second step, multiple relays cooperatively send out linear combinations
of signals received in the previous phase using space-time precoding so that
all users efficiently exploit their side-information in the form of: 1) what
they sent and 2) what they overheard in decoding. This coding concept is

improves the sum of degrees of freedom (sum-DoF) of the network compared to
existing interference management methods. With ST-PNC, the sum-DoF of a general

Copenhagen interpretation of measurement, an asynchronous joint probability
density (PDF), which is a function both of the different positions and
different times at which the particle and mirror are measured, is derived
assuming that no interaction occurs between each measurement. Measurement of
the particle first, in the correlated interference region, results in a
splitting of the mirror substate into ones which have and have not reflected

measurements of the particle (a marginal PDF), in this two-body system, is
shown to be a consequence of the asynchronous measurement. The simplification
obtained for a microscopic particle reflecting from a mesoscopic or macroscopic
mirror is used to illustrate asynchronous correlation interferometry. In this
case, the small displacement between these mirror states can yield negligible
environmental decoherence times. In addition, interference of these mirror
states does not vanish in the limit of large mirror mass due to the small

both the X-channel and three-user interference channel to reveal the impact on
how the CSI feedback delay affects the sum-DoF of the interference networks. A

at the transmitter in a certain class of interference networks. For a class of
X-channels, the results show how to optimally use distributed and

information together with a pre-existing set of beliefs. When the new
information comes in the form of a report from another agent, then it is clear
that we must first determine whether or not that agent should be trusted. In
this paper, we provide a formal approach to modeling trust as a pre-processing
step before belief revision. We emphasize that trust is not simply a relation
between agents; the trust that one agent has in another is often restricted to
a particular domain of expertise. We demonstrate that this form of trust can be
captured by associating a state-partition with each agent, then relativizing
all reports to this state partition before performing belief revision. In this
manner, we incorporate only the part of a report that falls under the perceived
domain of expertise of the reporting agent. Unfortunately, state partitions
based on expertise do not allow us to compare the relative strength of trust
held with respect to different agents. To address this problem, we introduce
pseudometrics over states to represent differing degrees of trust. This allows
us to incorporate simultaneous reports from multiple agents in a way that
ensures the most trusted reports will be believed.

the length scale of the particles (10 nm) through the Quartz Crystal
Microbalance technique, and that of the wires (> 1 micron) via optical
microscopy. Upon surfactant addition, the disassembly is initiated at the
surface of the wires by the release of nanoparticles and by the swelling of the

culminates in the complete dissolution of the wires, confirming the hypothesis

inspecting the wavefield, computing travel-time shifts, and performing
Fourier-Hankel analysis. The comparison between the results obtained for both
sunspot models reveals that the differences in the absorption coefficient can
be detected above noise level. The spaghetti model produces an steep increase

help of spectra for plasma temperatures between 0.1 and 10 keV and computed the
spectral evolution and the spatio-temporal distribution of the hot gas.
Results. Despite significant input of high temperature gas from supernovae and
fast stellar winds, the resulting thermal X-ray spectra are generally very
soft, with most of the emission well below 1 keV. We show that this is due to
mixing triggered by resolved hydrodynamic instabilities. Supernovae enhance the
X-ray luminosity of a superbubble by 1-2 orders of magnitude for a time span of
about 0.1 Myr; longer if a supernova occurs in a larger superbubble and shorter
in higher energy bands. Peak superbubble luminosities of the order of 10^{36}
erg/s are reproduced well. The strong decay of the X-ray luminosity is due to
bubble expansion, hydrodynamic instabilities related to the acceleration of the
superbubble's shell thanks to the sudden energy input, and subsequent mixing.
We also find global oscillations of our simulated superbubbles, which produce
spatial variations of the X-ray spectrum, similar to what we see in the
Orion-Eridanus cavity. We calculated the fraction of energy emitted in X-rays

$\BUC(\R^d)$ and $\AP(\R^d)$ are, respectively, the space of bounded uniformly
continuous functions and the space of almost periodic functions, in $\R^d$, and
$\oM(h)$ denotes the mean value of $h$, if it exists. We give a very simple
direct proof of the stochastic homogenization property of the Dirichlet problem
for fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic equations of the form
$F(\om,\frac{x}{\ve},D^2u)=0$, $x\in U$, in a bounded domain $U\subset\R^d$, in

process, that is, $F(\om,y,M)=\tilde F(T(y)\om,M):= F(T(y)\om,0,M)$, where
$T(y):\Om\to\Om$ is an ergodic group of measure preserving mappings such that
the mapping $(\om,y)\to T(y)\om$ is measurable. Also, $F(\om,y,M)$, $M\in\S^d$,
is uniformly elliptic, with ellipticity constants $0<\l<\gL$ independent of
$(\om,y)\in\Om\X\R^d$. The result presented here is a particular instance of
the general theorem of Caffarelli, Souganidis and Wang, in CPAM 2005. Our point
here is just to show a straightforward proof for this special case, which
serves as a motivation for that general theorem, whose proof involves much more
intricate arguments. We remark that any continuous stationary process verifies
the property that almost all realizations belong to an ergodic algebra, and

evolve misrepresentations of objective reality that help them cooperate and
maintain higher social welfare in the Prisoner's dilemma. These agents act
rationally on their subjective representations of the world, but irrationally
from the perspective of an external observer. We model misrepresentations as
subjective perceptions of payoffs and quasi-magical thinking as an inferential
bias, finding that the former is more conducive to cooperation. This highlights
the importance of internal representations, not just observed behavior, in
evolutionary thought. Our results provide support for the interface theory of
perception and suggest that the individual's interface can serve not only the
individual's aims, but also society as a whole, offering insight into social

both negative and positive regardless of whether the cells share common spatial

LDLf is a powerful logic that captures all monadic second order logic on finite
traces, which is obtained by combining regular expressions and LTLf, adopting
the syntax of propositional dynamic logic (PDL). Interestingly, in spite of its
greater expressivity, LDLf has exactly the same computational complexity of
LTLf. We show that LDLf is able to capture, in the logic itself, not only the
constraints to be monitored, but also the de-facto standard RV-LTL monitors.
This makes it possible to declaratively capture monitoring metaconstraints, and
check them by relying on usual logical services instead of ad-hoc algorithms.
This, in turn, enables to flexibly monitor constraints depending on the
monitoring state of other constraints, e.g., ""compensation"" constraints that
are only checked when others are detected to be violated. In addition, we
devise a direct translation of LDLf formulas into nondeterministic automata,
avoiding to detour to Buechi automata or alternating automata, and we use it to

construction, one starts from a flat torus with $16$ orbifold points, and
resolves the orbifold singularities by gluing in $16$ small Eguchi-Hanson
manifolds which all have the same orientation. This construction was carried
out rigorously by Topiwala, LeBrun-Singer, and Donaldson.
  In 1981, Page asked whether the above construction can be modified by
reversing the orientations of some of the Eguchi-Hanson manifolds. This is a
subtle question: if successful, this construction would produce Einstein
metrics which are neither K\""ahler nor self-dual.
  In this paper, we focus on a configuration of maximal symmetry involving $8$
small Eguchi-Hanson manifolds of each orientation which are arranged according
to a chessboard pattern. By analyzing the interactions between Eguchi-Hanson
manifolds with opposite orientation, we identify a non-vanishing obstruction to
the gluing problem, thereby destroying any hope of producing a metric of zero
Ricci curvature in this way. Using this obstruction, we are able to understand
the dynamics of such metrics under Ricci flow as long as the Eguchi-Hanson
manifolds remain small. In particular, for the configuration described above,
we obtain an ancient solution to the Ricci flow with the property that the
maximum of the Riemann curvature tensor blows up at a rate of
$(-t)^{\frac{1}{2}}$, while the maximum of the Ricci curvature converges to

(MRxMHD) equilibrium model that includes pressure anisotropy and general plasma
flows. This anisotropic extension to our previous isotropic model is motivated
by Sun and Finn's model of relaxed anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic equilibria.
We prove that as the number of plasma regions becomes infinite, our anisotropic
extension of MRxMHD reduces to anisotropic ideal MHD with flow. The
continuously nested flux surface limit of our MRxMHD model is the first
variational principle for anisotropic plasma equilibria with general flow

from stars, which in turn is determined primarily by the initial stellar mass.
Even stars as low as 0.9Msun can, at low metallicity, contribute to the
chemical evolution of elements. Stars less massive than about 10Msun experience
recurrent mixing events that can significantly change the surface composition
of the envelope, with observed enrichments in carbon, nitrogen, fluorine, and
heavy elements synthesized by the slow neutron capture process (the s-process).
Low and intermediate mass stars release their nucleosynthesis products through
stellar outflows or winds, in contrast to massive stars that explode as
core-collapse supernovae. Here we review the stellar evolution and
nucleosynthesis for single stars up to ~10Msun from the main sequence through
to the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). We include a discussion of the
main uncertainties that affect theoretical calculations and review the latest
observational data, which are used to constrain uncertain details of the
stellar models. We finish with a review of the stellar yields available for
stars less massive than about 10Msun and discuss efforts by various groups to
address these issues and provide homogeneous yields for low and

ubiquitous thin current sheets in the corona that could explain the observed
heating requirements. On the other hand, new high resolution observations of
the corona indicate that its magnetic field may tend to organise itself in fine
strand-like structures of few hundred kilometres widths. The link between small
structure in models and the observed widths of strand-like structure several
orders of magnitude larger is still not clear. A popular theoretical scenario
is the nanoflare model, in which each strand is the product of an ensemble of
heating events. Here, we suggest an alternative mechanism for strand
generation. Through forward modelling of 3D MHD simulations we show that small
amplitude transverse MHD waves can lead in a few periods time to strand-like
structure in loops in EUV intensity images. Our model is based on previous
numerical work showing that transverse MHD oscillations can lead to
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities that deform the cross-sectional area of loops.
While previous work has focused on large amplitude oscillations, here we show
that the instability can occur even for low wave amplitudes for long and thin
loops, matching those presently observed in the corona. We show that the
vortices generated from the instability are velocity sheared regions with
enhanced emissivity hosting current sheets. Strands result as a complex
combination of the vortices and the line-of-sight angle, last for timescales of
a period and can be observed for spatial resolutions of a tenth of loop radius.

the flow near triple collision.
  We emphasize the distinct features of the Schwarzschild model when compared
to its Newtonian counterpart. We prove that, in contrast to the Newtonian case,
on any level of energy the measure of the set on initial conditions leading to
triple collision is positive. Further, whereas in the Newtonian problem triple
collision is asymptotically reached only for zero angular momentum, in the
Schwarzschild problem the triple collision is possible for non-zero total
angular momenta (e.g., when two of the mass points spin infinitely many times
around the centre of mass). This phenomenon is known in celestial mechanics as
the ""black-hole effect"" and it is understood as an analogue in the classical
context of the behaviour near a Schwarzschild black hole. Also, while in the
Newtonian problem all triple collision orbits are necessarily homothetic, in
the Schwarzschild problem this is not necessarily true. In fact, in the
Schwarzschild problem there exist triple collision orbits which are neither
homothetic, nor homographic.

robustness to individual differences such as face scale and shape, age-related

data at scale. The model of streaming graph processing, in which a compact
summary is maintained as each edge insertion/deletion is observed, is an
attractive one. However, few results are known for optimization problems over
such dynamic graph streams.
  In this paper, we introduce a new approach to handling graph streams, by
instead seeking solutions for the parameterized versions of these problems
where we are given a parameter $k$ and the objective is to decide whether there
is a solution bounded by $k$. By combining kernelization techniques with
randomized sketch structures, we obtain the first streaming algorithms for the
parameterized versions of the Vertex Cover problem. We consider the following
three models for a graph stream on $n$ nodes:
  1. The insertion-only model where the edges can only be added.
  2. The dynamic model where edges can be both inserted and deleted.
  3. The \emph{promised} dynamic model where we are guaranteed that at each
timestamp there is a solution of size at most $k$.
  In each of these three models we are able to design parameterized streaming
algorithms for the Vertex Cover problem. We are also able to show matching
lower bound for the space complexity of our algorithms.

We apply hierarchical clustering (HC) on DNA k-mer counts of multiple RNA-seq
derived Fastq files. Ideally, HC generated trees reflect experimental treatment
groups and thus may indicate experimental effects, but clustering of
preparation groups indicates the presence of batch effects. In order to provide
a simple applicable tool we implemented sequential analysis of Fastq reads with
low memory usage in an R package (seqTools) available on Bioconductor. DNA
k-mer counts were analysed on 61 Fastq files containing RNA-seq data from two
cell types (dermal fibroblasts and Jurkat cells) sequenced on 8 different

hierarchical clustering revealed strong Flowcell based tree separation in 6 (21

comparisons. In our samples, batch effects were also present in reads mapped to
the human genome. Filtering reads for high quality (Phred >30) did not remove
the batch effects. Conclusions: Hierarchical clustering of DNA k-mer counts
provides a quality criterion and an unspecific diagnostic tool for RNA-seq

objects, following the classical Zariski correspondence between irreducible
affine varieties and the prime spectrum of the coordinate algebra in affine
algebraic geometry. Although in this context the natural analog of the
polynomial ring over a field is the polynomial semiring over a semifield
(without a zero element), one obtains homomorphic images of coordinate algebras
via congruences rather than ideals, which complicates the algebraic theory
considerably.
  In this paper, we pass to the semifield $F(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n)$ of
fractions of the polynomial semiring, for which there already exists a well
developed theory of kernels, which are normal convex subgroups; this approach
enables us to switch the structural roles of addition and multiplication and
makes available much of the extensive theory of chains of homomorphisms of
groups, including the Jordan-Holder theory. The parallel of the zero set now is
the 1-set.
  These notions are refined in the language of supertropical algebra to
$\nu$-kernels and $1^\nu$-sets, lending more precision to the theory. In
analogy to Hilbert's celebrated Nullstellensatz which provides a correspondence
between radical ideals and zero sets, we develop a correspondence between
$1^\nu$-sets and a well-studied class of $\nu$-kernels of the rational
semifield called polars, originating from the theory of lattice-ordered groups.
This correspondence becomes simpler and more applicable when restricted to a
special kind of kernel, called principal, intersected with the kernel generated
by $F$. We utilize this theory to study tropical roots in tropical geometry. As
an application, we develop composition series and convexity degree, leading to
a tropical version of the Jordan-H\""{o}lder theorem.

$\chi_{red}^2$ for the ""hard-to-soft"" (HTS) pulses, while for the ""intensity

models. Interestingly, the energy at the peak of the spectrum resulting from
the BBPL model ($\sim3kT$), is always lower than that of the $\nu F_{\nu}$
spectrum of the Band function. The values of the low energy photon index
($\alpha$) of the Band function are often higher than the fundamental single
particle synchrotron limit, especially for the HTS pulses. Specifically we find
two extreme cases --- for GRB~110817A (HTS GRB) $\alpha$ is always higher,
while for GRB~100528A (IT GRB) $\alpha$ is always within the synchrotron
regime. The PL component of the BBPL model always starts with a delay compared
to the BB component, and it lingers at the later part of the prompt emission
phase. For three HTS GRBs, namely, GRB~081224, GRB~100707A and GRB~110721A this
behaviour is particularly significant and interestingly there are reported LAT

acceptable models for the set of GRBs we have analyzed.

Assume that each particle hits the body at most once (SIC condition); then the
force of resistance of the body along the flow direction can be written down in
a simple analytical form.
  The problem of minimal resistance within this model was first considered by
Newton (1687) in the class of bodies with a fixed length M along the flow
direction and with a fixed maximum orthogonal cross section, under the
additional conditions that the body is convex and rotationally symmetric. Here
we solve the problem (first stated by Ferone, Buttazzo, and Kawohl in 1995) for
the wider class of bodies satisfying SIC and with the additional conditions
removed. The scheme of solution is inspired by Besicovitch's method of solving
the Kakeya problem. If the maximum cross section is a disc, the decrease of
resistance as compared with the original Newton problem is more than twofold;
the ratio tends to 2 as M goes to 0 and to 81/4 as M goes to infinity. We also
prove that the infimum of resistance is 0 for a wider class of bodies with both
single and double impacts allowed.

counter-rotating regime where a mixture of stable and unstable regions exist.
Furthermore, an analogy between $\eta$ and outer-cylinder rotation is revealed,
namely that smaller gaps behave like a wider gap with co-rotating cylinders,
and that wider gaps behave like smaller gaps with weakly counter-rotating
cylinders. Finally, the effect of $\Gamma$ on the effective torque versus $Ta$
scaling is analysed and it is shown that different branches of the
torque-versus-$Ta$ relationships associated to different aspect ratios are
found to cross within $15%$ of the $Re$ associated to the transition to the
ultimate regime. The paper culminates in phase diagram in the inner vs outer
$Re$ number parameter space and in the $Ta$ vs $Ro$ parameter space, which can
be seen as the extension of the Andereck \emph{et al.} phase diagram towards
the ultimate regime.

based on yield (or damage) functions, which may exhibit features (for instance,

elastic domains) preventing the use of efficient return-mapping integration
schemes. This problem is solved by proposing a general construction strategy to
define an implicitly defined convex yield function starting from any convex

return-mapping integration scheme is implemented and tested for elastic-plastic

introduces a numerical cost when compared to situations where the scheme is not

tackle here the important problem of fixing convective zones boundaries in the

way to locate a convective zone boundary is to find, at each iteration step,
through interpolations or extrapolations from points $\textit{within the
convective zone}$, the mass where the radiative luminosity is equal to the
total one. We then discuss two misuses of the boundary condition and the way
they affect stellar modeling and stellar evolution. The first one consists in
applying the neutrality condition for convective instability on the
$\textit{radiative}$ side of the convective boundary. The second way of
misusing the boundary condition comes from the process of fixing the convective
boundary through the search for a change of sign of a possibly
\textit{discontinuous} function. We show that these misuses can lead to
completely wrong estimates of convective core sizes with important consequences
for the following evolutionary phases. We point out the advantages of using a
double mesh point at each convective zone boundaries. The specific problem of a

loss to magnetic tube waves that can freely carry energy out of the acoustic

atmosphere composed of a polytropic interior above which lies an isothermal
upper atmosphere. The sausage tube waves, excited by $p$ modes, propagate along
a magnetic fibril which is assumed to be a vertically aligned, stratified, thin
magnetic flux-tube. The deficit of $p$-mode energy is quantified through the
damping rate, $\Gamma$ and absorption coefficient, $\alpha$. The variation of
$\Gamma$ and $\alpha$ as a function of frequency and the tube's plasma
properties is studied in detail. Previous similar studies have considered only
a subphotospheric layer, modelled as a polytrope that has been truncated at the
photosphere (Bogdan et al. (1996), Hindman & Jain 2008, Gascoyne et al.

lack of a upper atmosphere have been imposed in a somewhat ad hoc manner. The
model presented here avoids such problems by using an isothermal layer to model
the overlying atmosphere (chromosphere), and consequently, allows us to analyse
the propagation of $p$-mode driven sausage waves above the photosphere. In this
paper we restrict our attention to frequencies below the acoustic cut-off
frequency. We demonstrate the importance of coupling all waves (acoustic,

the gradient field of the distance function and then learn the distance
function itself. Specifically, we set the gradient field of a local distance
function as an initial vector field. Then we transport it to the whole manifold

obtained by requiring its gradient field to be close to the normalized vector
field. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

a separated design: the controls are updated at each time instant as per a
certainty equivalence law, and the encoder is chosen to minimize an aggregate
quadratic distortion of the estimation error. This separation is shown to hold
even though a dual effect is present in the closed-loop system. We also show
that this separated design need not be optimal when the controller or encoder

that apply nonlocal operators to the error signal to generate the control.
Currently, the most famous controller with nonlocal operators is the
fractional-order PID (FOPID). Commonly, after tuning the parameters of FOPID
controller, its transfer function is discretized (for realization purposes)
using the so-called generating function. This discretization is the origin of
some errors and unexpected results in feedback systems. It may even happen that
the controller obtained by discretizing a FOPID controller works worse than a
directly-tuned discrete-time classical PID controller. Moreover, FOPID
controllers cannot directly be applied to the processes modeled by, e.g., the
ARMA or ARMAX model. The aim of this paper is to propose a discrete-time
version of the FOPID controller and discuss on its properties and applications.
Similar to the FOPID controller, the proposed structure applies nonlocal
operators (with adjustable memory length) to the error signal. Two methods for
tuning the parameters of the proposed controller are developed and it is shown
that the proposed controller has the capacity of solving complicated control
problems with a high performance.

process. We are able to parse sentences in near linear-time by ruling out
analyses early on that are incompatible with spatial context. We report a 34%
upper bound on accuracy, as our planner correctly processes spatial context for
3,394 out of 10,000 sentences. However, our parser achieves a 96.53%
exact-match score for parsing within the subset of sentences recognized by the
planner, compared to 82.14% for a non-contextual parser.

nano-machines is considered. The effect of the amount of memory on performance
is characterized, and a simple memory-limited decoder is proposed and its
performance is shown to be close to that of the best possible imaginable
decoder (without any restriction on the computational complexity or its
functional form), using Genie-aided upper bounds. This effect is specialized
for the case of Molecular Concentration Shift Keying; it is shown that a
four-bits memory achieved nearly the same performance as infinite memory. Then
a general class of threshold decoders is considered and shown not to be optimal
for Poisson channel with memory, unless SNR is higher than a value specified in
the paper. Another contribution is to show that receiver sampling at a rate
higher than the transmission rate, i.e., a multi-read system, can significantly
improve the performance. The associated decision rule for this system is shown
to be a weighted sum of the samples during each symbol interval. The
performance of the system is analyzed using the saddle point approximation. The
best performance gains are achieved for an oversampling factor of three.

differential extinction; and the resulting improvement in the calibration
allows us to perform weighted averaging of contemporaneous data from different
BiSON stations. The improvements listed produce significant improvement in the

future work to provide greater constraint on changes in the oscillation

states. Using surface-sensitive vacuum-ultraviolet ARPES, we revealed
two-dimensional surface states which form three electron-like Fermi surfaces
(FSs) with Dirac-cone-like dispersions. The odd number of surface FSs gives the
first indication that YbB6 is a moderately correlated topological insulator.
The spin-resolved ARPES measurements provide further evidence that these
surface states are spin polarized with spin locked to the crystal momentum. We
have observed a second set of surface states with different topology (hole-like
pockets). Clear folding of the bands suggest their origin from a 1X2
reconstructed surface. The topological property of the reconstructed surface
states needs further studies.

optical properties of single and coupled microcavities for a variety of
applications, ranging from filters to sensors and lasers. The focus has been
mostly on the geometry of individual resonators and/or on their combination in
arrangements often referred to as photonic molecules (PMs).
  Our primary concern will be the lasing properties of PMs as ideal candidates
for the fabrication of integrated microlasers, photonic molecule lasers.
Whereas most calculations on PM lasers have been based on cold-cavity (passive)
modes, i.e. quasi-bound states, a recently formulated steady-state ab initio
laser theory (SALT) offers the possibility to take into account the spectral
properties of the underlying gain transition, its position and linewidth, as
well as incorporating an arbitrary pump profile. We will combine two
theoretical approaches to characterize the lasing properties of PM lasers: for
two-dimensional systems, the generalized Lorenz-Mie theory will obtain the
resonant modes of the coupled molecules in an active medium described by SALT.
Not only is then the theoretical description more complete, the use of an
active medium provides additional parameters to control, engineer and harness
the lasing properties of PM lasers for ultra-low threshold and directional
single-mode emission.

$\mu=max(|E_i|)$ is the maximum {\em instant} density, to be contrasted with
$m=|\cup E_i|$, the {\em cumulated} density. Indeed, it is not uncommon for a

lines in some type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) originate mainly from dust residing at
~1 pc from the supernovae. In this Na-from-dust absorption (NaDA) model the
process by which the SN Ia peak luminosity releases sodium from dust at 1 pc
from the SN is similar to the processes by which solar radiation releases
sodium from cometary dust when comets approach a distance of 1 AU from the Sun.
The dust grains are not sublimated but rather stay intact, and release sodium
by photon-stimulated desorption (PSD; or photo-sputtering). Some of the Na
might start in the gas phase before the explosion. Weakening in absorption
strength is caused by Na-ionizing radiation of the SN. We apply the NaDA model
to SN 2006X and SN 2007le, and find it to comply better with the observed time
variability of the NaI D absorption lines than the Na recombination model. The
mass in the dusty shell of the NaDA model is much too high to be accounted for
in the single-degenerate scenario for SN Ia. Therefore, the presence of
variable NaI D lines in some SN Ia further weakens the already very problematic
single-degenerate scenario for SN Ia.

pile on a table rotating underneath a stationary plate; the continual
circulation of the bulldozed material allows the dynamics to be explored over
relatively long times, and the variation of the velocity with radius permits
one to explore the dependence on bulldozing speed within a single experiment.
We measure the time-dependent surface shape of the dune for a range of rotation
rates, initial volumes and radial positions, for four granular materials,
ranging from glass spheres to irregularly shaped sand. The evolution of the
dune can be separated into two phases: a rapid initial adjustment to a state of
quasi-steady avalanching perpendicular to the blade, followed by a much slower
phase of lateral spreading and radial migration. The quasi-steady avalanching
sets up a well-defined perpendicular profile with a nearly constant slope. This
profile can be scaled by the depth against the bulldozer to collapse data from
different times, radial positions and experiments onto common master curves
that are characteristic of the granular material and depend on the local Froude
number. The lateral profile of the dune along the face of the bulldozer varies
more gradually with radial position, and evolves by slow lateral spreading. The
spreading is asymmetrical, with the inward progress of the dune eventually
arrested and its bulk migrating to larger radii. A one-dimensional
depth-averaged model recovers the nearly linear perpendicular profile of the
dune, but does not capture the finer nonlinear details of the master curves. A
two-dimensional version of the model leads to an advection-diffusion equation
that reproduces the lateral spreading and radial migration.

whether there is a substring of $T$ matching a pattern represented as a Parikh
vector, i.e., the vector of frequency counts for each character. Jumbled
indexing has garnered a lot of interest in the last four years. There is a
naive algorithm that preprocesses all answers in $O(n^2|\Sigma|)$ time allowing
quick queries afterwards, and there is another naive algorithm that requires no
preprocessing but has $O(n\log|\Sigma|)$ query time. Despite a tremendous
amount of effort there has been little improvement over these running times.
  In this paper we provide good reason for this. We show that, under a
3SUM-hardness assumption, jumbled indexing for alphabets of size $\omega(1)$
requires $\Omega(n^{2-\epsilon})$ preprocessing time or $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$
query time for any $\epsilon,\delta>0$. In fact, under a stronger 3SUM-hardness
assumption, for any constant alphabet size $r\ge 3$ there exist describable
fixed constant $\epsilon_r$ and $\delta_r$ such that jumbled indexing requires
$\Omega(n^{2-\epsilon_r})$ preprocessing time or $\Omega(n^{1-\delta_r})$ query

from the anomalous U(1)_X D-term with moduli-dependent FI term is crucial for

a global Minkowski vacuum where the imaginary part of T_1 has a quadratic

Claims have been made that the Tolman test provides compelling evidence against
a static model for the Universe. In this paper we reconsider this subject by
adopting a static Euclidean Universe with a linear Hubble relation at all z
(which is not the standard Einstein- de Sitter model),resulting in a relation
between flux and luminosity that is virtually indistinguishable from the one
used for LCDM models. Based on the analysis of the UV surface brightness of
luminous disk galaxies from HUDF and GALEX datasets, reaching from the local
Universe to z ~ 5 we show that the surface brightness remains constant as
expected in a SEU.
  A re-analysis of previously-published data used for the Tolman test at lower
redshift, when treated within the same framework, confirms the results of the
present analysis by extending our claim to elliptical galaxies. We conclude
that available observations of galactic SB are consistent with a static
Euclidean model of the Universe.
  We do not claim that the consistency of the adopted model with SB data is
sufficient by itself to confirm what would be a radical transformation in our
understanding of the cosmos. However, we believe this result is more than
sufficient reason to examine further this combination of hypotheses.

Skyrme model with twist: twisted Skyrmion string. Twist term, $mkz$, is
indicated in vortex solution. Necessary condition for stability of vortex
solution has consequence that energy of vortex is minimum and scale-free
(vortex solution is neutrally stable to changes in scale). We find numerically
that the value of vortex minimum energy per unit length for twisted Skyrmion
string is $20.37\times 10^{60}~\text{eV/m}$.

theory, including symmetries and formalism of interest, will precede a focused
discussion on the use of an Effective Field Theory (EFT) as a low energy
perturbative expansion technique. Regularization schemes involved in Chiral
Perturbation Theory (\c{hi}PT) will be reviewed and compared with EFT. Lattices
will be discussed as a useful procedure for studying large mass particles. An
Effective Field Theory will be formulated, and the self energy of the \r{ho}
meson for a Finite-Range Regulated (FRR) theory will be calculated. This will
be performed in both full QCD and the simpler quenched approximation (QQCD).
Finite-volume artefacts, due to the finite box size on the lattice, will be
quantified. Currently known lattice results will be used to calculate the
\r{ho} meson mass, and the possibility of unquenching will be explored. The aim
of the research was to determine whether a stable unquenching procedure for the
\r{ho} meson could be discovered. The results from the original research
indicate that there is no such procedure because the \r{ho} mesons are
unstable. Unless additional data involving lighter quark masses is available,
an element of modelling is needed for successful unquenching.

feature-preserving smoothing of signals on images, meshes, and other domains
within a single unified framework. Our discretization is competitive with
state-of-the-art smoothing techniques in terms of both accuracy and speed, is
easy to implement, and has parameters that are straightforward to understand.
Unlike previous bilateral filters developed for meshes and other irregular
domains, our construction reduces exactly to the image bilateral on rectangular
domains and comes with a rigorous foundation in both the smooth and discrete
settings. These guarantees allow us to construct unconditionally convergent
mean-shift schemes that handle a variety of extremely noisy signals. We also
apply our framework to geometric edge-preserving effects like feature
enhancement and show how it is related to local histogram techniques.

clustering, community detection in networks, and multiple parametric model
estimation. We are interested in merging solutions from different grouping
algorithms, distilling all their good qualities into a consensus solution. In
this paper, we propose a bi-clustering framework and perspective for reaching
consensus in such grouping problems. In particular, this is the first time that
the task of finding/fitting multiple parametric models to a dataset is formally
posed as a consensus problem. We highlight the equivalence of these tasks and
establish the connection with the computational Gestalt program, that seeks to
provide a psychologically-inspired detection theory for visual events. We also
present a simple but powerful bi-clustering algorithm, specially tuned to the
nature of the problem we address, though general enough to handle many
different instances inscribed within our characterization. The presentation is
accompanied with diverse and extensive experimental results in clustering,
community detection, and multiple parametric model estimation in image
processing applications.
