to take values in the tropical rings (max-plus algebras) over the real numbers.
We show that rank-finiteness of join matrices implies that these graph

commutative semirings, this remains true for graph classes of bounded linear
clique-width. B. Godlin, T. Kotek and J.A. Makowsky (2008) showed that
definability of a graph parameter in Monadic Second Order Logic implies rank

mobile elements and highly variable regions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in the 496 basic-genome pairs are identified and clonally inherited
stretches are distinguished from those acquired by horizontal transfer (HT) by
sharp discontinuities in SNP density. The six least diverged genome-pairs each
have only one or two HT stretches, each occupying 42-115-kbp of basic genome
and containing at least one gene cluster known to confer selective advantage.
At higher divergences, the typical mosaic pattern of interspersed clonal and HT
stretches across the entire basic genome are observed, including likely
fragmented integrations across a restriction barrier. A simple model suggests
that individual HT events are of the order of 10-kbp and are the chief
contributor to genome divergence, bringing in almost 12 times more SNPs than
point mutations. As a result of continuing horizontal transfer of such large
segments, 400 out of the 496 strain-pairs beyond genomic divergence of share
virtually no genomic material with their common ancestor. We conclude that the
active and continuing horizontal transfer of moderately large genomic fragments

distribute random genome fragments throughout the population by generalized

periodic wave packet reconstruction. Such a phenomenon, referred to as dynamic
localization (DL), occurs for certain magic values of the ratio $\Gamma=F_0/
\omega$ between the amplitude $F_0$ and frequency $\omega$ of the ac force. It
is generally believed that in the low-frequency limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$)
DL can be achieved for an infinitesimally small value of the force $F_0$, i.e.
at finite values of $\Gamma$. Such a normal behavior is found in homogeneous
lattices as well as in inhomogeneous lattices of Glauber-Fock type. Here we
introduce a tight-binding lattice model with inhomogeneous hopping rates,
referred to as pseudo Glauber-Fock lattice, which shows DL but fails to
reproduce the normal low-frequency behavior of homogeneous and Glauber-Fock

at the DL condition the force amplitude $F_0$ remains finite as $\omega

$\mathbb{R}^{d}$, $d\geq2$, and assume its boundary $\partial\Omega$ is smooth.
Consider solving an elliptic partial differential equation $Lu=f$ over $\Omega$
with zero Dirichlet boundary value. The function $f$ is a nonlinear function of
the solution $u$. The problem is converted to an equivalent\ elliptic problem
over the open unit ball $\mathbb{B}^{d}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, say
$\widetilde{L}\widetilde{u}=\widetilde{f}$. Then a spectral Galerkin method is
used to create a convergent sequence of multivariate polynomials
$\widetilde{u}_{n}$ of degree $\leq n$ that is convergent to $\widetilde{u}$.
The transformation from $\Omega$ to $\mathbb{B}^{d}$ requires a special
analytical calculation for its implementation. With sufficiently smooth problem
parameters, the method is shown to be rapidly convergent. For $u\in
C^{\infty}\left( \overline{\Omega }\right) $ and assuming $\partial\Omega$ is a
$C^{\infty}$ boundary, the convergence of $\left\Vert

any power of $1/n$. Numerical examples illustrate experimentally an exponential
rate of convergence. A generalization to $-\Delta u+\gamma u=f$ with a zero
Neumann boundary condition is also presented.

causation, used in many areas of science. They are, however, intrinsically
classical. In particular, Bayesian networks naturally yield the Bell
inequalities. Inspired by this connection, we generalise the formalism of
classical Bayesian networks in order to investigate non-classical correlations
in arbitrary causal structures. Our framework of `generalised Bayesian
networks' replaces latent variables with the resources of any generalised
probabilistic theory, most importantly quantum theory, but also, for example,
Popescu-Rohrlich boxes. We obtain three main sets of results. Firstly, we prove
that all of the observable conditional independences required by the classical
theory also hold in our generalisation; to obtain this, we extend the classical
$d$-separation theorem to our setting. Secondly, we find that the
theory-independent constraints on probabilities can go beyond these conditional
independences. For example we find that no probabilistic theory predicts
perfect correlation between three parties using only bipartite common causes.
Finally, we begin a classification of those causal structures, such as the Bell
scenario, that may yield a separation between classical, quantum and
general-probabilistic correlations.

  When the number of measurements $L$ at each observation time within the
observation window is larger than a sufficient minimum value $L_s$, the
impediments in the estimation procedure are removed. As the number of available
observations is typically such that $L \ll L_s$, additional information from

removing the impediments to accurate estimation and permitting dependable
prediction. We do this in a core geophysical fluid dynamics model, the shallow
water equations, at the heart of numerical weather prediction. The method is
quite general, however, and can be utilized in the analysis of a broad spectrum
of complex systems where measurements are sparse. When the model of the complex

patterns of state-space matrices of large-scale systems. The computational and
memory complexity of the approximation algorithms are $O(N)$, where $N$ is the
number of local subsystems of the interconnected system. Consequently, the

growth conditions, the function $B$ is a continuous and $\mu$ is a radon
measure. Our first task is to establish the existence results with $B(u,\nabla
u)=\pm|u|^{q-1}u$, for $q>1$. We next obtain global weighted-Lorentz,
Lorentz-Morrey and Capacitary estimates on gradient of solutions with $B\equiv
0$, under minimal conditions on the boundary of domain and on nonlinearity $A$.
Finally, due to these estimates, we solve the existence problems with
$B(u,\nabla u)=|\nabla u|^q$ for $q>1$

of eventual non-sensitivity and eventual fragmentability. As a notable
application we obtain a neat characterization of tame subshifts $X \subset
\{0,1\}^{\mathbb Z}$: for every infinite subset $L \subseteq {\mathbb Z}$ there
exists an infinite subset $K \subseteq L$ such that $\pi_{K}(X)$ is a countable
subset of $\{0,1\}^K$. The notion of eventual fragmentability is one of the
properties we encounter which indicate some ""smallness"" of a family. We
investigate a ""smallness hierarchy"" for families of continuous functions on
compact dynamical systems, and link the existence of a ""small"" family which
separates points of a dynamical system $(G,X)$ to the representability of $X$
on ""good"" Banach spaces. For example, for metric dynamical systems the property
of admitting a separating family which is eventually fragmented is equivalent
to being tame. We give some sufficient conditions for coding functions to be
tame and, among other applications, show that certain multidimensional
analogues of Sturmian sequences are tame. We also show that linearly ordered
dynamical systems are tame and discuss examples where some universal dynamical
systems associated with certain Polish groups are tame.

instruments. The striking action of a hammer or mallet in keyboard and
percussion instruments is perhaps the most important example, but others
include reed-beating effects in wind instruments, the string/neck interaction
in fretted instruments such as the guitar as well as in the sitar and the
wire/membrane interaction in the snare drum. From a simulation perspective,
whether the eventual goal is the validation of musical instrument models or
sound synthesis, such highly nonlinear problems pose various difficulties, not
the least of which is the risk of numerical instability. In this article, a
novel finite difference time domain simulation framework for such collision
problems is developed, where numerical stability follows from strict numerical
energy conservation or dissipation, and where a a power law formulation for
collisions is employed, as a potential function within a Hamiltonian
formulation. The power law serves both as a model of deformable collision, and
as a mathematical penalty under perfectly rigid, non-deformable collision. This
formulation solves a major problem underlying previous work, where a
Hamiltonian framework was not employed for collisions, and thus stability was
not ensured. Various numerical examples, illustrating the unifying features of
such methods across a wide variety of systems in musical acoustics are
presented, including numerical stability and energy conservation/dissipation,
bounds on spurious penetration in the case of rigid collisions, as well as
various aspects of musical instrument physics.

electroweak bounds to dark matter observables. The mass spectra of the scalar

compatible to that of the ordinary 3-3-1 breaking. All the interactions of the
gauge bosons with the fermions and scalars are obtained. The 3-3-1-1 model
provides two dark matters which are stabilized by the W-parity conservation:
one fermion which may be either a Majorana or Dirac fermion and one complex
scalar. We conclude that in the fermion dark matter setup the Z_2 gauge boson
resonance sets the dark matter observables, whereas in the scalar one the Higgs
portal dictates them. The standard model GIM mechanism works in the model
because of the W-parity conservation. Hence, the dangerous flavor changing
neutral currents due to the ordinary and exotic quark mixing are suppressed,

realized with guided, radially polarized laser pulses in density-modulated

the interactions among the laser field, injected electrons, and the background
plasma in the DLA process. Simulations have been conducted to study the scheme
in which seed electron bunches with moderate energies are injected into a
plasma waveguide and the DLA is performed by use of relatively low-power (0.5-2
TW) laser pulses. Selected bunch injection delays with respect to the laser
pulse, bunch lengths, and bunch transverse sizes have been studied in a series
of simulations of DLA in a plasma waveguide. The results show that the
injection delay is important for controlling the final transverse properties of
short electron bunches, but it also affects the final energy gain. With a long
injected bunch length, the enhanced ion-focusing force helps to collimate the
electrons and a relatively small final emittance can be obtained. DLA
efficiency is reduced when a bunch with a greater transverse size is injected;
in addition, micro-bunching is clearly observed due to the focusing and
defocusing of electrons by the radially directed Lorentz force. DLA should be
performed with a moderate laser power to maintain favorable bunch transverse
properties, while the waveguide length can be extended to obtain a higher
maximum energy gain, with the commensurate increase of laser pulse duration and
energy.

As part of our studies of the HI morphology and kinematics in isolated
late-type galaxies we have chosen several very isolated galaxies from the AMIGA
sample for HI mapping. Here we present GMRT 21-cm HI line mapping of CIG 340
which was selected because its integrated HI spectrum has a very symmetric
profile, Aflux = 1.03. Optical images of the galaxy hinted at a warped disk in
contrast to the symmetric integrated HI spectrum profile. Our aim is to
determine the extent to which the optical asymmetry is reflected in the
resolved HI morphology and kinematics. GMRT observations reveal significant HI
morphological asymmetries in CIG 340 despite it's overall symmetric optical
form and highly symmetric HI spectrum. The most notable HI features are: 1) a
warp in the HI disk (with an optical counterpart), 2) the HI north/south flux
ratio = 1.32 is much larger than expected from the integrated HI spectrum
profile and 3) a ~ 45"" (12 kpc) HI extension, containing ~ 6% of the detected
HI mass on the northern side of the disk. We conclude that in isolated galaxies
a highly symmetric HI spectrum can mask significant HI morphological
asymmetries. The northern HI extension appears to be the result of a recent
perturbation (10^8 yr), possibly by a satellite which is now disrupted or
projected within the disk. This study provides an important step in our ongoing
program to determine the predominant source of HI asymmetries in isolated
galaxies. For CIG 340 the isolation from major companions, symmetric HI
spectrum, optical morphology and interaction timescales have allowed us to
narrow the possible causes the HI asymmetries and identify tests to further
constrain the source of the asymmetries.

time-scale of random fluctuations in TF copy numbers arising from stochastic
gene expression. A stochastic model of TF gene expression, together with decoy
site interactions is formulated. Distributions for the total (bound and
unbound) and free (unbound) TF levels are derived by analytically solving the
chemical master equation under physiologically relevant assumptions. Our
results show that increasing the number of decoy binding sides considerably
reduces stochasticity in free TF copy numbers. The TF autocorrelation function
reveals that decoy sites can either enhance or shorten the time-scale of TF
fluctuations depending on model parameters. To understand how noise in TF
abundances propagates downstream, a TF target gene is included in the model.
Intriguingly, we find that noise in the expression of the target gene decreases
with increasing decoy sites for linear TF-target protein dose-responses, even
in regimes where decoy sites enhance TF autocorrelation times. Moreover,
counterintuitive noise transmissions arise for nonlinear dose-responses. In
summary, our study highlights the critical role of molecular sequestration by
decoy binding sites in regulating the stochastic dynamics of TFs and target

indicate that the TeV gamma-ray shell shows significant spatial correlation
with the interstellar protons at a velocity range from -90 km/s to -75 km/s,
and the distance corresponding to the velocity range is ~5.2 kpc, a factor of 2
larger than the previous figure 3 kpc. The total mass of the interstellar
protons is estimated to be 6.4x10^4 M_sun, 25 % of which is atomic gas. We have
identified the cold HI gas observed as self-absorption which shows significant
correspondence with the northeastern gamma-ray peak. While the good
correspondence between the interstellar protons and TeV gamma-rays in the north
of the SNR lends support to the hadronic scenario for the TeV gamma-rays, the
southern part of the shell shows a break in the correspondence; in particular,
the southwestern rim of the SNR shell shows a significant decrease of the
interstellar protons by a factor of 2. We argue that this discrepancy can be
explained as due to leptonic gamma-rays, because this region well coincides
with the bright shell which emit non-thermal radio continuum emission and
non-thermal X-rays, suggesting that the gamma-rays of HESS J1713-347 consist of
both the hadronic and leptonic components. The leptonic contribution then
corresponds to ~20 % of the total gamma-rays. The total energy of cosmic-ray
protons is estimated to be 10^49 erg for the gamma-ray energy range of 1 GeV -
100 TeV by assuming that 80 % of the total gamma-ray is of the hadronic origin.

previous work of Li et al. \cite{LWZ}, Pankov \cite{Pa} and Szulkin and Weth

of our approach lies on finding a minimizing Cerami sequence for the energy

This expectation is verified in low genus and supported by Harer's computation
of its de Rham cohomological dimension and by vanishing results in the
tautological intersection ring.
  In this paper we prove that such dimension is at most $2g-2$. We also prove
an analogous bound for the moduli space of Riemann surfaces with marked points.
The key step is to show that the Dolbeault cohomological dimension of each
stratum of translation surfaces is at most $g$. In order to do that, we produce
an exhaustion function whose complex Hessian has controlled index: the
construction of such a function relies on some basic geometric properties of

A bright X-ray ""bullet"" leads a ""twin-tailed"" wake, with the SZ centroid at the

by detailed X-ray, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ), and Hubble lensing and dynamical
data. The X-ray morphology and the location of the two Dark Matter components

about 480 million years after the first core passage. We derive an impact
parameter of ~300 kpc, and a relative initial infall velocity of ~2250 km/sec
when separated by the sum of the two virial radii assuming an initial total
mass of 2.15x10^(15) Msun and a mass ratio of 1.9. Our model demonstrates that
tidally stretched gas accounts for the Northern X-ray tail along the collision

molecular dynamics (MD) at high strain rates where the MD results are valid,
but, importantly, is able to access experimental strain rates that are about
ten orders of magnitude slower than MD. In doing so, we find in agreement with
previous experimental studies that a substantial decrease in yield stress is
observed with decreasing strain rate. At room temperature and laboratory strain
rates, the activation volume associated with yield is found to contain about 10
LJ particles, while the yield stress is as sensitive to a $1.5\%T_{\rm g}$
increase in temperature as it is to a one order of magnitude decrease in strain
rate. Moreover, our SLME results suggest the SLME and extrapolated results from

undertake a deep narrow- and broad-band imaging survey of the surrounding
field. Within a comoving volume of 72x72x25 Mpc^3, we have identified 65 Lyman
alpha emitter (LAE) candidates at z=3.795+/-0.015, and four additional galaxies
at z_spec=3.730,3.753,3.780,3.835. The galaxy distribution within the field is
highly non-uniform, exhibiting three large (~3-5x) overdensities separated by
8-14 Mpc (physical) and possibly connected by filamentary structures traced by
LAEs. The observed number of LAEs in the entire field is nearly twice the
average expected in field environments, based on estimates of the Lya
luminosity function at these redshifts. We estimate that by z=0 the largest
overdensity will grow into a cluster of mass 10^15 Msun; the two smaller
overdensities will grow into clusters of mass (2-6)x10^14 Msun. The highest
concentration of galaxies is located at the southern end of the image,
suggesting that the current imaging may not map the true extent of the large
scale structure. Finding three large protocluster candidates within a single
0.3 deg^2 field is highly unusual; expectations from theory suggest that such
alignments should occur less than 2% of the time. Searching for and
characterizing such structures and accurately measuring their volume space
density can therefore place constraints on the theory of structure formation.
Such regions can also serve as laboratories for the study of galaxy formation
in dense environments.

Superbubbles from clustered young stars evolve quite differently to individual
supernovae and are substantially more efficient at generating gas motions. The
essential new components of the model are thermal conduction, sub-grid
evaporation and a sub-grid multi-phase treatment for cases where the simulation
mass resolution is insufficient to model the early stages of the superbubble.
The multi-phase stage is short compared to superbubble lifetimes. Thermal
conduction physically regulates the hot gas mass without requiring a free
parameter. Accurately following the hot component naturally avoids overcooling.
Prior approaches tend to heat too much mass, leaving the hot ISM below $10^6$ K
and susceptible to rapid cooling unless ad-hoc fixes were used. The hot phase
also allows feedback energy to correctly accumulate from multiple, clustered
sources, including stellar winds and supernovae.
  We employ high-resolution simulations of a single star cluster to show the
model is insensitive to numerical resolution, unresolved ISM structure and
suppression of conduction by magnetic fields. We also simulate a Milky Way
analog and a dwarf galaxy. Both galaxies show regulated star formation and
produce strong outflows.

is constant at log Rsb < 0, while it increases with starburstiness at log Rsb >

indicate that starburst galaxies have deficient polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon

study the benefits and limits of replacing the highly specialized internal

its native internal scheduler, PaRSEC, and StarPU frameworks, on different

generic task-based runtimes achieve comparable results to the
application-optimized embedded scheduler on homogeneous platforms. Furthermore,
they are able to significantly speed up the solver on heterogeneous
environments by taking advantage of the accelerators while hiding the
complexity of their efficient manipulation from the programmer.

the X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and is believed to originate
in neutral material, possibly located in the molecular torus. This would imply
a tight connection between the Fe K$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW) and the
physical properties of the torus. In a recent work we have shown that the
decrease of the covering factor of the torus with the luminosity, as expected
by luminosity-dependent unification models, would be able to explain the
decrease of Fe K$\alpha$ EW with the luminosity (i.e., the X-ray Baldwin
effect). Recent developments in the study of the mid-IR (MIR) spectrum of AGN
allow important parameters of the torus to be deduced, such as its covering
factor ($f_{\rm\,obs}$) and equatorial column density ($N_{\rm\,H}^{\rm\,T}$),
by applying clumpy torus models. Using XMM-Newton/EPIC observations of a sample
of 24 type-I AGN, we investigate the relation between the physical parameters
of the torus obtained by recent MIR works and the properties of the Fe
K$\alpha$ line. We correct the values of the Fe K$\alpha$ EW by taking the
inclination angle, the photon index, the equatorial column density, and
half-opening angle of the torus into account using a physical torus model of
X-ray reprocessed radiation. We find that the relation between Fe K$\alpha$ EW
and $f_{\rm\,obs}$ shows a slope that is consistent with the expected value,
albeit with a low statistical significance. A trend that is consistent with the
theoretical prediction is also found when comparing the Fe K$\alpha$ EW to
$N_{\rm\,H}^{\rm\,T}$. Our work seems to confirm that the bulk of the narrow Fe
K$\alpha$ line is produced by the same material responsible for the MIR
emission.

characterized by an alternating sequence of treatments or other actions and
transition times between disease states. The sequence of transition states may
vary substantially from patient to patient, depending on how the regime plays
out, and in practice there often are many possible counterfactual outcome
sequences. For evaluating the regimes, the mean final overall time may be
expressed as a weighted average of the means of all possible sums of successive
transitions times. A common example arises in cancer therapies where the
transition times between various sequences of treatments, disease remission,
disease progression, and death characterize overall survival time. For the
general setting, we propose estimating mean overall outcome time by assuming a
Bayesian nonparametric regression model for the logarithm of each transition
time. A dependent Dirichlet process prior with Gaussian process base measure
(DDP-GP) is assumed, and a joint posterior is obtained by Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We provide general guidelines for constructing a prior
using empirical Bayes methods. We compare the proposed approach with inverse
probability of treatment weighting. These comparisons are done by simulation
studies of both single-stage and multi-stage regimes, with treatment assignment
depending on baseline covariates. The method is applied to analyze a dataset
arising from a clinical trial involving multi-stage chemotherapy regimes for
acute leukemia. An R program for implementing the DDP-GP-based Bayesian

strong dependence of the burst properties on the flux and spectral hardness of

with the theoretical predictions of NS atmosphere models. However, bursts
occurring during the high-accretion rate (soft) state show roughly constant
normalisation, which is inconsistent with the NS atmosphere models and
therefore these bursts cannot be easily used to determine NS parameters. We
analyse the hard-state burst to put the lower limit on the neutron star radius

two-sample test. Its quadratic time complexity, however, greatly hampers its
availability to large-scale applications. To accelerate the MMD calculation, in
this study we propose an efficient method called FastMMD. The core idea of
FastMMD is to equivalently transform the MMD with shift-invariant kernels into
the amplitude expectation of a linear combination of sinusoid components based
on Bochner's theorem and Fourier transform (Rahimi & Recht, 2007). Taking
advantage of sampling of Fourier transform, FastMMD decreases the time
complexity for MMD calculation from $O(N^2 d)$ to $O(L N d)$, where $N$ and $d$
are the size and dimension of the sample set, respectively. Here $L$ is the
number of basis functions for approximating kernels which determines the
approximation accuracy. For kernels that are spherically invariant, the
computation can be further accelerated to $O(L N \log d)$ by using the Fastfood
technique (Le et al., 2013). The uniform convergence of our method has also
been theoretically proved in both unbiased and biased estimates. We have
further provided a geometric explanation for our method, namely ensemble of
circular discrepancy, which facilitates us to understand the insight of MMD,
and is hopeful to help arouse more extensive metrics for assessing two-sample
test. Experimental results substantiate that FastMMD is with similar accuracy
as exact MMD, while with faster computation speed and lower variance than the
existing MMD approximation methods.

and require an optimal survey design in order to attain maximum scientific
returns from a fixed amount of available telescope time. The super-sample
covariance (SSC), which arises from unobservable modes that are larger than the
survey size, significantly degrades the statistical precision of weak lensing
power spectrum measurement even for a wide-area survey. Using the 1000 mock
realizations of the log-normal model, which approximates the weak lensing field
for a $\Lambda$-dominated cold dark matter model, we study an optimal survey
geometry to minimize the impact of SSC contamination. For a continuous survey
geometry with a fixed survey area, a more elongated geometry such as a
rectangular shape of 1:400 side-length ratio reduces the SSC effect and allows
for a factor 2 improvement in the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio ($S/N$) of
power spectrum measurement up to $\ell_{\rm max}\simeq $ a few $10^3$, compared
to compact geometries such as squares or circles. When we allow the survey
geometry to be disconnected but with a fixed total area, assuming $1\times 1$
sq. degrees patches as the fundamental building blocks of survey footprints,
the best strategy is to locate the patches with $\sim 15$ degrees separation.
This separation angle corresponds to the scale at which the two-point
correlation function has a negative minimum. The best configuration allows for
a factor 100 gain in the effective area coverage as well as a factor 2.5

significantly reduces the memory cost of calculations. It uses a direct product
primitive basis, but does not require storing vectors with as many components
as there are product basis functions. Wavefunctions are represented in a basis
each of whose functions is a sum of products (SOP) and the factorizable
structure of the Hamiltonian is exploited. If the factors of the SOP basis
functions are properly chosen, wavefunctions are linear combinations of a small
number of SOP basis functions. The SOP basis functions are generated using a
shifted block power method. The factors are refined with a rank reduction
algorithm to cap the number of terms in a SOP basis function. The ideas are
tested on a 20-D model Hamiltonian and a realistic CH$_3$CN (12 dimensional)
potential. For the 20-D problem, to use a standard direct product iterative
approach one would need to store vectors with about $10^{20}$ components and
would hence require about $8 \times 10^{11}$ GB. With the approach of this
paper only 1 GB of memory is necessary. Results for CH$_3$CN agree well with
those of a previous calculation on the same potential.

$\frac{\sqrt\lambda}{\pi} \log {\cal S}$ term where $\sqrt{\lambda}$ is

We observe that the logarithmic divergence in the area of the light like Wilson

indicates that the coefficient of $ b^2 \log^2 {\cal S}$ has a property similar

that our results may be applied in quantum problems of nuclear dynamics or even
in apparently exotic phenomena in vibrating neutron stars. And, of course, some

and subsequently converted into the polarized electron-positron pairs in a
target-converter. The Compton multiple Interaction Point (IP) line is proposed
as one of the solutions to increase the number of the positrons produced. The
gamma ray production with the Compton multiple IP line is simulated and used
for polarized positron generation. Later, a capture section based on an
adiabatic matching device (AMD) followed by a pre-injector linac is simulated
to capture and accelerate the positron beam.

problem, where the risk measure considered is Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR).
We propose two algorithms that obtain a locally risk-optimal policy by
employing four tools: stochastic approximation, mini batches, policy gradients
and importance sampling. Both the algorithms incorporate a CVaR estimation
procedure, along the lines of Bardou et al. [2009], which in turn is based on
Rockafellar-Uryasev's representation for CVaR and utilize the likelihood ratio
principle for estimating the gradient of the sum of one cost function
(objective of the SSP) and the gradient of the CVaR of the sum of another cost
function (in the constraint of SSP). The algorithms differ in the manner in
which they approximate the CVaR estimates/necessary gradients - the first
algorithm uses stochastic approximation, while the second employ mini-batches
in the spirit of Monte Carlo methods. We establish asymptotic convergence of
both the algorithms. Further, since estimating CVaR is related to rare-event
simulation, we incorporate an importance sampling based variance reduction
scheme into our proposed algorithms.

finite segment has randomly rough boundaries is developed. It enables one to
take account of all mechanisms of wave scattering, both related to boundary
roughness and to contacts between the wire rough section and the leads within
the same technical frameworks. The rough part of the conducting wire is shown
to act as a mode-specific randomly modulated effective potential barrier whose
height is governed essentially by the asperity slope. The mean height of the
barrier specifies the number of conducting channels. Under relatively small
asperity amplitude this number can take on arbitrary small values if the
asperities are sufficiently sharp. The channel cut-off that arises when the
asperity sharpness increases can be regarded as a kind of localization, which
is not related to the disorder but rather is of entropic origin. The
fluctuating part of the barrier results in two fundamentally different types of
guided wave scattering, viz., inter- and intramode scattering. The intermode
scattering is shown to be for the most part very strong except in the cases of
(a) extremely smooth asperities, (b) excessively small length of the corrugated
segment, and (c) the asperities sharp enough for only one conducting channel to
remain in the wire. Under strong intermode scattering, a new set of conducting
channels develops, which have the form of decoupled extended modes subject to
individual random potentials. In view of this fact, two transport regimes only
are realizable in randomly corrugated multimode wires, specifically, the
ballistic and the localized regime, the latter characteristic of
one-dimensional random systems. Two kinds of localization are thus shown to
coexist in waveguide-like systems with randomly corrugated boundaries,
specifically, the entropic localization and the one-dimensional Anderson
localization.

We find that over long timescales a log-parabola provides an adequate

significantly better than a simple power law or broken power law description.
Broken power law descriptions appear to arise from two causes: confusion with
nearby sources and as an artifact of older LAT instrument response functions.
  We create a light curve for 2FGLJ2253.9+1609 (3C 454.3), the brightest of the
objects investigated. During the quiescent state we find the spectrum to be
fairly stable and well-described by a log-parabola. There is some evidence
that, on average, the peak energy of the inverse Compton emission is lower in
the quiescent state than in the time-averaged state, suggesting that increases
in flux are due to changing parameters within the jet as opposed to changes in
an external photon field. However, no correlation between inverse Compton peak
energy and flux is apparent. During high flux states, deviation of the spectral
shape from a simple power law continues. In some cases a log-parabola provides
a significantly better fit than a broken power law but in others the reverse is
true.

appearance in the study of Painlev\'e hierarchies, where the question of the
reduction of order is of great importance. However, here we do not consider
such particular cases; instead we study such systems for arbitrary $\mathbf K$,
where they may represent both integrable and nonintegrable systems of ordinary
differential equations. We consider the application of the Prelle-Singer (PS)
method --- a method used to find first integrals --- to such systems in order
to reduce their order. We consider the cases of coupled second order ODEs and
coupled third order ODEs, as well as the special case of a scalar third order
ODE; for the case of coupled third order ODEs, the development of the PS method
presented here is new. We apply the PS method to examples of such systems,
based on dispersive water wave, Ito and Korteweg-de Vries Hamiltonian
structures, and show that first integrals can be obtained. It is important to
remember that the equations in question may represent sequences of systems of
increasing order. We thus see that the PS method is a further technique which

that with a constant EoS, $w=-1.141\pm{0.075}$ ($68\%~C.L.$), which is
consistent with $\Lambda$CDM at about $2\sigma$ confidence level. For a time
evolving $w(a)$ model, we get $w_0=-1.09^{+0.16}_{-0.18}$ ($1\sigma~C.L.$),
$w_a=-0.34^{+0.87}_{-0.51}$ ($1\sigma~C.L.$), and in this case $\Lambda$CDM can
be comparable with our observational data at $1\sigma$ confidence level. In
order to do the parametrization independent analysis, additionally we adopt the
so called principal component analysis (PCA) method, in which we divide
redshift range into several bins and assume $w$ as a constant in each redshift
bin (bin-w). In such bin-w scenario, we find that for most of the bins
cosmological constant can be comparable with the data, however, there exists
few bins which give $w$ deviating from $\Lambda$CDM at more than $2\sigma$

$2N$ null-state equations and three conformal Ward identities that govern CFT
correlation functions of $2N$ one-leg boundary operators. In the first two

$\dim\mathcal{S}_N\leq C_N$, with $C_N$ the $N$th Catalan number. Building on

successful in enabling spin qubit experiments in all-electrical, semiconductor
based quantum computing. As experiments grow more sophisticated, and head
towards multiple qubit architectures that enable small scale computation, it
becomes important to consider the charge read-out overhead. With this in mind,
Reilly et al. demonstrated a gate readout scheme in a GaAs double quantum dot
that removed the need for an external charge sensor. This readout, which
achieved sensitivities of order me/$\sqrt(Hz)$, was enabled by using a resonant
circuit to probe the complex radio-frequency polarisability of the double
quantum dot. However, the ultimate performance of this technology and the noise
sources that limit it remain to be determined. Here, we investigate a

coupled to a double quantum at the corner states of a silicon nanowire
transistor. We find a significantly improved charge sensitivity of 37
$\mu$e/$\sqrt(Hz)$. By solving the dynamical master equation of the fast-driven
electronic transitions we quantify the noise spectral density and determine the
ultimate charge and phase sensitivity of gate-based read-out. We find
comparable performance to conventional charge sensors and fundamental limits of
order ne/$\sqrt(Hz)$ and $\mu$rad/$\sqrt(Hz)$, with the gate-based sensor
improving on standard detection for certain device parameters. Our results show
that, especially in state-of-the-art silicon qubit architectures, charge
detection by probing the complex polarisability has advantages in terms of
reducing the readout overhead but also in terms of the absolute charge
sensitivity.

obtain a formula for the average search time and the average energy expended by
N search agents acting concurrently and independently of each other. We see
that the time-out itself can be used to minimise the search time and the amount
of energy that is consumed to find an object. An approximate formula is derived
for the number of search agents that can help us guarantee that an object is

namely the ferroelectric thermoelectrics may exhibit enhanced functionalities
due to the coupling of the thermoelectric parameters with ferroelectric
polarization in solids. Therefore, the ferroelectric thermoelectrics are
expected to be of immense technological and fundamental significance. As a
first step towards this direction, it is most important to identify the
existing high performance thermoelectric materials exhibiting ferroelectricity.
Herein, through the direct measurement of local polarization switching we show
that the recently discovered thermoelectric semiconductor $AgSbSe_{2}$ has
local ferroelectric ordering. Using piezo-response force microscopy, we
demonstrate the existence of nanometer scale ferroelectric domains that can be
switched by external electric field. These observations are intriguing as
$AgSbSe_{2}$ crystalizes in cubic rock salt structure with centro-symmetric
space group (Fm-3m) and therefore no ferroelectricity is expected. However,
from high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurement we
found the evidence of local superstructure formation which, we believe, leads
to local distortion of the centro-symmetric arrangement in $AgSbSe_{2}$ and
gives rise to the observed ferroelectricity. Stereochemically active $5s^{2}$
lone pair of Sb can also give rise to local structural distortion, which
creates ferroelectricity in $AgSbSe_{2}$.

of highly variable mass-loss. S Sct exhibits a bright, spherically symmetric
detached shell, 138"" in diameter and co-spatial with an already known CO

morphology seems indicative of a mild shaping by interaction of the wind with
the interstellar medium, which is also supported by the stellar space motion.
Two shells are found around RT Cap that were not known so far in either dust
emission or from molecular line observations. The inner shell with a diameter
of 188"" shows an almost immaculate spherical symmetry, while the outer ~5'

self-coupling and the heavy right-handed neutrino mass coupling. Following this
See-Saw Inflation one also finds that the seesaw mechanism provides for an
after electroweak symmetry breaking offset in the Inflaton potential at the
near GUT scale vev by an amount set by the lightest neutrino and thus as a
consequence produces a ""Dark Energy"" at a scale set by the lightest left-handed
neutrino mass $m_{\nu_L} \sim 10^{-3}$ eV. Since these neutrinos are Majorana
particles and violate lepton number conservation, they are the natural
mediators of baryogenesis at the electroweak scale. The residual heavy
right-handed neutrinos work out to be Dark Matter with some fine tuning. So an
unaesthetic fine-tuned model can address the four remaining fundamental issues
of cosmology by linking them to the neutrino sector. The resurrected SO(10) GUT

which simulate protoplanetary disks beyond 10s of AU, the vertical scale height
of dust is larger than previously predicted. To understand this anomaly in more
detail, we carry out both unstratified and stratified local shearing box
simulations with Lagrangian particles, and find that turbulence in AD dominated
disks has very different properties (e.g., temporal autocorrelation functions
and power spectra) than turbulence in ideal MHD disks, which leads to quite
different particle diffusion efficiency. For example, MRI turbulence with AD
has a longer correlation time for the vertical velocity, which causes
significant vertical particle diffusion and large dust scale height. In ideal
MHD the Schmidt numbers ($Sc$) for radial and vertical turbulent diffusion are
$Sc_{r}\sim 1$ and $Sc_{z}\gtrsim 3$, but in the AD dominated regime both
$Sc_{r}$ and $Sc_{z}$ are $\lesssim 1$. Particle concentration in pressure
bumps induced by MRI turbulence has also been studied. Since non-ideal MHD
effects dominate most regions in protoplanetary disks, our study suggests that
modeling dust transport in turbulence driven by MRI with non-ideal MHD effects
is important for understanding dust transport in realistic protoplanetary
disks.

FDD massive MIMO systems because of the overwhelming training and feedback
overhead. In this paper, we consider multi-user massive MIMO systems and deploy
the compressive sensing (CS) technique to reduce the training as well as the
feedback overhead in the CSIT estimation. The multi-user massive MIMO systems
exhibits a hidden joint sparsity structure in the user channel matrices due to
the shared local scatterers in the physical propagation environment. As such,
instead of naively applying the conventional CS to the CSIT estimation, we
propose a distributed compressive CSIT estimation scheme so that the compressed
measurements are observed at the users locally, while the CSIT recovery is
performed at the base station jointly. A joint orthogonal matching pursuit
recovery algorithm is proposed to perform the CSIT recovery, with the
capability of exploiting the hidden joint sparsity in the user channel
matrices. We analyze the obtained CSIT quality in terms of the normalized mean
absolute error, and through the closed-form expressions, we obtain simple
insights into how the joint channel sparsity can be exploited to improve the

view it as a computation that transforms an initial state to a final one. This
paradigm has been explored in discrete systems such as cellular automata
models, where the relation between dynamics and computation has been examined
in detail. Here, motivated by microfluidic experiments on arrays of chemical
oscillators, we show that computation can be achieved in continuous-state,
continuous-time systems by using complex spatiotemporal patterns generated
through a reaction-diffusion mechanism in coupled relaxation oscillators. We
present two paradigms that illustrate this computational capability, namely,
using perturbations to (i) generate propagating configurations in a system of
initially exactly synchronized oscillators, and (ii) transform one
time-invariant pattern to another. In particular, we have demonstrated a
possible implementation of NAND logic. This raises the possibility of universal
computation in such systems as all logic gates can be constructed from NAND
gates. Our work suggests that more complex schemes can potentially implement
arbitrarily complicated computation using reaction-diffusion processes,
bridging pattern formation with universal computability.

by the magnetorotational instability on particle trapping, using global
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations including Lagrangian
dust particles. We study disks either in the ideal MHD limit or dominated by
ambipolar diffusion (AD) that plays an essential role at the outer regions of a
protoplanetary disk. With ideal MHD, strong turbulence (the equivalent
viscosity parameter $\alpha\sim 10^{-2}$) in disks prevents vortex formation at
the edge of the gap opened by a 9 $M_{J}$ planet, and most particles (except
the particles that drift fastest) pile up at the outer gap edge almost
axisymmetrically. When AD is considered, turbulence is significantly suppressed
($\alpha\lesssim 10^{-3}$), and a large vortex forms at the edge of the planet
induced gap, which survives $\sim$ 1000 orbits. The vortex can efficiently trap
dust particles that span 3 orders of magnitude in size within 100 planetary
orbits. We have also carried out two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations
using viscosity as an approximation to MHD turbulence. These hydrodynamical
simulations can reproduce vortex generation at the gap edge as seen in MHD
simulations. Finally, we use our simulation results to generate synthetic
images for ALMA dust continuum observations on Oph IRS 48 and HD 142527, which
show good agreement with existing observations. Predictions for future ALMA
cycle 2 observations have been made. We conclude that the asymmetry in ALMA
observations can be explained by dust trapping vortices and the existence of
vortices could be the evidence that the outer protoplanetary disks are
dominated by ambipolar diffusion with $\alpha<10^{-3}$ at the disk midplane.

the input data space as the Fisher information distance on the associated
statistical manifold. This induces in the input data space a new family of
distance metric with unique properties. Unlike kernelized metric learning, we
do not require the similarity measure to be positive semi-definite. Moreover,
it can also be interpreted as a local metric learning algorithm with well
defined distance approximation. We evaluate its performance on a number of
datasets. It outperforms significantly other metric learning methods and SVM.

rare domain F = {x | g(x) > q} with respect to the distribution of a random
vector X, Multilevel Splitting strategies (also called Subset Simulation) aim
at writing F as an intersection of less rare events (nested subsets) such that
their measures are conditionally easily computable. However the definition of
an appropriate sequence of nested subsets remains an open issue.
  We introduce here a new approach to Multilevel Splitting methods in terms of
a move of particles in the input space. This allows us to derive two main
results: (1) the number of samples required to get a realisation of X in F is
drastically reduced, following a Poisson law with parameter log 1/p (to be
compared with 1/p for naive Monte-Carlo); and (2) we get a parallel optimal
Multilevel Splitting algorithm where there is indeed no subset to define any
more.
  We also apply result (1) in quantile estimation producing a new parallel
algorithm and derive a new strategy for the construction of first Design Of
Experiments in meta-model based algorithms.

functions (cdf) in order to employ linear computations in the probabilistic
domain. The reasoning by means of p-box cdf-intervals is an interval
computation which is exerted on the real domain then it is projected onto the

obtained probabilistic bounds. The empirical evaluation of our implementation
shows that, with minimal overhead, the output solution set realizes a full

electrical distribution systems, Active Network Management (ANM) becomes a
valuable option for a distribution system operator to operate his system in a
secure and cost-effective way without relying solely on network reinforcement.
ANM strategies are short-term policies that control the power injected by
generators and/or taken off by loads in order to avoid congestion or voltage
issues. Advanced ANM strategies imply that the system operator has to solve
large-scale optimal sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. For
example, decisions taken at a given moment constrain the future decisions that
can be taken and uncertainty must be explicitly accounted for because neither
demand nor generation can be accurately forecasted. We first formulate the ANM
problem, which in addition to be sequential and uncertain, has a nonlinear
nature stemming from the power flow equations and a discrete nature arising
from the activation of power modulation signals. This ANM problem is then cast
as a stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear program, as well as second-order cone
and linear counterparts, for which we provide quantitative results using state
of the art solvers and perform a sensitivity analysis over the size of the
system, the amount of available flexibility, and the number of scenarios
considered in the deterministic equivalent of the stochastic program. To foster
further research on this problem, we make available at
http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~anm/ three test beds based on distribution
networks of 5, 33, and 77 buses. These test beds contain a simulator of the
distribution system, with stochastic models for the generation and consumption
devices, and callbacks to implement and test various ANM strategies.

  Probability Under Rayleigh Flat Fading Channel","Accepted in 10th International Conference on Signal Processing and
  Communications 2014 (SPCOM'14), Bangalore, India, July 2014",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The effect of the primary traffic on a secondary user's (SU) throughput under
Rayleigh flat fading channel is investigated. For this case, closed form
expressions are derived for the average probability of detection and the
average probability of false alarm. Based on these expressions, the average SU
throughput under the desired signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraint in order to
maintain the quality of the secondary link is found analytically considering
the random arrival or departure of the primary user. It is shown that the
spectrum sensing performance and SU throughput degrade with increase in the
primary traffic and the deep fade condition of the channel over which the
detection is performed. The degree of degradation in SU throughput is seen to
be severed further due to the interference link from the primary transmitter to
the secondary receiver. Under these detrimental effects, a sensing-throughput
trade-off for SU is illustrated. Finally, the combined effect of the primary
traffic, fading, imperfect spectrum sensing and the interference link from a
primary transmitter is studied on the outage probability at SU.

introduce the Localized Reduced Basis Multiscale method to obtain a

applying ideas from model order reduction for parametrized partial differential
equations, we are able to split the computational effort for solving the

inexpensive online step that is carried out in every time step of the two-phase
flow simulation, which is thereby largely accelerated. Usage of elements from
numerical multiscale methods allows us to displace the computational intensity
between the offline and online step to reach an ideal runtime at acceptable
error increase for the two-phase flow simulation.

HIP 112158 is poorly suited for the role of a kinematic sibling of the Sun by
its age and spectroscopic characteristics. For the single star HIP 43852 and
the multiple system HIP 104047, this role is quite possible. We have also
confirmed the status of our previously found candidates for close encounters,
HIP 47399 and HIP 87382. The star HIP 87382 with a chemical composition very
close to the solar one is currently the most likely candidate, because it

Gyr when using various Galactic potential models both without and with

attempts to decode the primary packet. When the primary queue is empty, the SU
splits the total channel bandwidth into two orthogonal subbands and assigns

protocol over the prioritized cognitive relaying (PCR) protocol in which the SU
assigns a priority in transmission to the primary packets over its own packets.
We present two problem formulations, one based on throughput and the other on
delay. Both optimization problems are shown to be linear programs for a given
bandwidth assignment. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of the

the optimization problem used to obtain the stability region's envelope
(closure) is established and is shown to be a linear program which can be
solved efficiently and reliably. We compare our orthogonal allocation system
with two typical low-complexity and intuitive band allocation systems. In one
system, each cognitive user chooses a band randomly in each time slot with some
assignment probability designed such that the system maintained stable, while
in the other system fixed (deterministic) band assignment is adopted throughout
the lifetime of the network. We derive the stability regions of these two
systems. We prove mathematically, as well as through numerical results, the
advantages of our proposed orthogonal system over the other two systems.

a primary user (PU) which dedicates a free frequency subband for the SU if
cooperation results in energy saving. Time is slotted and users are equipped
with buffers. Under the proposed protocol, the PU releases portion of its
bandwidth for secondary transmission. Moreover, it assigns a portion of the
time slot duration for the SU to relay primary packets and achieve a higher
successful packet reception probability at the primary receiver. We assume that
the PU has three states: idle, forward, and retransmission states. At each of
these states, the SU accesses the channel with adaptive transmission
parameters. The PU cooperates with the SU if and only if the achievable average
number of transmitted primary packets per joule is higher than the number of
transmitted packets per joule when it operates alone. The numerical results
show the beneficial gains of the proposed cooperative cognitive protocol.
