star, typically either gravitationally (the Doppler method) or by the small dip
in brightness as the planet blocks a portion of the star (the transit method).
Therefore, the accuracy with which we know the masses and radii of extrasolar
planets depends directly on how well we know those of the stars, the latter
usually determined from the measured stellar surface gravity, logg. Recent work
has demonstrated that the short-timescale brightness variations (""flicker"") of
stars can be used to measure logg to a high accuracy of ~0.1-0.2 dex (Bastien
et al. 2013). Here, we use flicker measurements of 289 bright (Kepmag<13)
candidate planet-hosting stars with Teff=4500-6650 K to re-assess the stellar
parameters and determine the resulting impact on derived planet properties.
This re-assessment reveals that for the brightest planet-host stars, an
astrophysical bias exists that contaminates the stellar sample with evolved
stars: nearly 50% of the bright planet-host stars are subgiants. As a result,
the stellar radii, and hence the radii of the planets orbiting these stars, are
on average 20-30% larger than previous measurements had suggested.

on negative results in the framework of the Sherali-Adams (SA) Lift and Project

  Our main result pertains to the standard LP (linear programming) relaxation
of ATSP, due to Dantzig, Fulkerson, and Johnson. For any fixed integer $t\geq
0$ and small $\epsilon$, $0<\epsilon\ll{1}$, there exists a digraph $G$ on
$\nu=\nu(t,\epsilon)=O(t/\epsilon)$ vertices such that the integrality ratio
for level~$t$ of the SA system starting with the standard LP on $G$ is $\ge
1+\frac{1-\epsilon}{2t+3} \approx \frac43, \frac65, \frac87, \dots$. Thus, in
terms of the input size, the result holds for any $t = 0,1,\dots,\Theta(\nu)$
levels. Our key contribution is to identify a structural property of digraphs
that allows us to construct fractional feasible solutions for any level~$t$ of
the SA system starting from the standard~LP. Our hard instances are simple and
satisfy the structural property.
  There is a further relaxation of the standard LP called the balanced LP, and
our methods simplify considerably when the starting LP for the SA system is the
balanced~LP; in particular, the relevant structural property (of digraphs)
simplifies such that it is satisfied by the digraphs given by the well-known
construction of Charikar, Goemans and Karloff (CGK). Consequently, the CGK
digraphs serve as hard instances, and we obtain an integrality ratio of $1
+\frac{1-\epsilon}{t+1}$ for any level~$t$ of the SA system, where
$0<\epsilon\ll{1}$ and the number of vertices is
$\nu(t,\epsilon)=O((t/\epsilon)^{(t/\epsilon)})$.
  Also, our results for the standard~LP extend to the Path-ATSP (find a min
cost Hamiltonian dipath from a given source vertex to a given sink vertex).

recently, analysis of high-Reynolds number experimental boundary layer data has

observations motivate the question whether LES can accurately reproduce the
variance and the higher-order moments, in particular their logarithmic
dependency on distance to the wall. In this study we perform LES of very high
Reynolds number wall-modeled channel flow and focus on profiles of variance and
higher-order moments of the streamwise velocity fluctuations. In agreement with
the experimental data, we observe an approximately logarithmic law for the
variance in the LES, with a `Townsend-Perry' constant of $A_1\approx 1.25$. The
LES also yields approximate logarithmic laws for the higher-order moments of
the streamwise velocity. Good agreement is found between $A_p$, the generalized
`Townsend-Perry' constants for moments of order $2p$, from experiments and

understanding the nature of solar coronal phenomena at all scales. We employed
STEREO/COR1 data obtained during a deep minimum of solar activity in February
2008 (Carrington rotation CR 2066) to retrieve and analyze the
three-dimensional (3D) coronal electron density in the range of heights from
1.5 to 4 Rsun using a tomography method. With this, we qualitatively deduced
structures of the coronal magnetic field. The 3D electron density analysis is
complemented by the 3D STEREO/EUVI emissivity in the 195 A band obtained by
tomography for the same CR. A global 3D MHD model of the solar corona was used
to relate the reconstructed 3D density and emissivity to open/closed magnetic
field structures. We show that the density maximum locations can serve as an
indicator of current sheet position, while the locations of the density
gradient maximum can be a reliable indicator of coronal hole boundaries. We
find that the magnetic field configuration during CR 2066 has a tendency to
become radially open at heliocentric distances greater than 2.5 Rsun. We also
find that the potential field model with a fixed source surface (PFSS) is
inconsistent with the boundaries between the regions with open and closed
magnetic field structures. This indicates that the assumption of the potential
nature of the coronal global magnetic field is not satisfied even during the
deep solar minimum. Results of our 3D density reconstruction will help to
constrain solar coronal field models and test the accuracy of the magnetic
field approximations for coronal modeling.

that the two measures are monotone functions of each other in most cases, and
this suggests that the nG-based measure is a suitable choice to capture the
anharmonic nature of a quantum oscillator, and to quantify its nonlinearity
independently on the specific features of the potential. We also provide
examples of potentials where the Bures measure cannot be defined, due to the
lack of a proper reference harmonic potential, while the nG-based measure
properly quantify their nonlinear features. Our results may have implications

orbital plane and the stellar equator (called the spin-orbit angle) has been
measured. For about half of them, a significant misalignment is detected, and
retrograde planets have been observed. This challenges scenarios of the
formation of hot Jupiters.
  In order to better constrain formation models, we relate the distribution of
the real spin-orbit angle $\Psi$ to the projected one $\beta$. Then, a
comparison with the observations is relevant.
  We analyse the geometry of the problem to link analytically the projected
angle $\beta$ to the real spin-orbit angle $\Psi$. The distribution of $\Psi$
expected in various models is taken from the literature, or derived with a
simplified model and Monte-Carlo simulations in the case of the disk-torquing
mechanism.
  An easy formula to compute the probability density function (PDF) of $\beta$
knowing the PDF of $\Psi$ is provided. All models tested here look compatible
with the observed distribution beyond 40 degrees, which is so far poorly
constrained by only 18 observations. But only the disk-torquing mechanism can
account for the excess of aligned hot Jupiters, provided that the torquing is
not always efficient. This is the case if the exciting binaries have semi-major
axes as large as 10000 AU.
  Based on comparison with the set of observations available today, scattering
models and the Kozai cycle with tidal friction models can not be solely
responsible for the production of all hot Jupiters. Conversely, the presently
observed distribution of the spin-orbit angles is compatible with most hot
Jupiters having been transported by smooth migration inside a proto-planetary
disk, itself possibly torqued by a companion.

trimer super\-fluid described by these terms is driven by photoassociation. The
phase transition between the trimer super\-fluid phase and other phases are
also studied. Without the on-site interaction, the phase transition between the
trimer superfluid phase and the Mott Insulator phase is continuous. Turning on
the on-site interaction, the phase transitions are first order with Mott
insulators of atom filling $1$ and $2$. With nonzero atom tunneling, the phase
transition is first order from the atom superfluid to the trimer superfluid. In
the trimer superfluid phase, the win\-ding numbers can be divided by three
without any remainders. In the atom superfluid and pair superfluid, the
vorticities are $1$ and $1/2$, respectively. However, the vorticity is $1/3$

proved that $A$ is quasi-hereditary (with respect to an explicit partial order

than those corresponding to perfect staggering. The observed trends have
implications for wind farm designs, especially in sites with a well-defined

classical vector fields, for which one needs to construct the tangent bundle of

implementing the intuitive notion of vectors as infinitesimal displacements. We
introduce regularity conditions for prevector fields, defined by finite
differences, thus purely combinatorial conditions involving no analysis. These
conditions replace the more elaborate analytic regularity conditions appearing
in previous similar approaches, e.g. by Stroyan and Luxemburg or Lutz and Goze.
We define the flow of a prevector field by hyperfinite iteration of the given
prevector field, in the spirit of Euler's method. We define the Lie bracket of
two prevector fields by appropriate iteration of their commutator. We study the
properties of flows and Lie brackets, particularly in relation with our
proposed regularity conditions. We present several simple applications to the

analysis of small oscillations of a pendulum, and an instance of Frobenius'

body of results which has revolutionized the theory of orthogonal polynomials
on the unit circle. This formula can be understood as a factorization of the
Schur function for an orthogonal polynomial modification of a measure on the
unit circle. No such formula is known in the case of matrix-valued measures.
This constitutes the main obstacle to generalize Khrushchev theory to the
matrix-valued setting which we overcome in this paper.
  It was recently discovered that orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle and
their matrix-valued versions play a significant role in the study of quantum
walks, the quantum mechanical analogue of random walks. In particular, Schur
functions turn out to be the mathematical tool which best codify the return
properties of a discrete time quantum system, a topic in which Khrushchev's
formula has profound and surprising implications. We will show that this
connection between Schur functions and quantum walks is behind a simple proof
of Khrushchev's formula via `quantum' diagrammatic techniques for CMV matrices.
This does not merely give a quantum meaning to a known mathematical result,
since the diagrammatic proof also works for matrix-valued measures. Actually,
this path counting approach is so fruitful that it provides different matrix
generalizations of Khrushchev's formula, some of them new even in the case of
scalar measures.
  Furthermore, the path counting approach allows us to identify the properties
of CMV matrices which are responsible for Khrushchev's formula. On the one
hand, this helps to formalize and unify the diagrammatic proofs using simple
operator theory tools. On the other hand, this is the origin of our main result
which extends Khrushchev's formula beyond the CMV case, as a factorization rule
for Schur functions related to general unitary operators.

searching for new physics signals, are some of the most important tasks of
Particle Physics today. Current measurements of the Higgs couplings to fermions
and gauge bosons, seem consistent with the Standard Model, and when taken as a
function of the particle mass, should lay on a single line. However, in models
with an extended Higgs sector the diagonal Higgs couplings to up-quarks,
down-quarks and charged leptons, could lay on different lines, while
non-diagonal flavor-violating Higgs couplings could appear too. We describe
these possibilities within the context of multi-Higgs doublet models that
employ the Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism to generate the Yukawa hierarchies.
Furthermore, one of the doublets can be chosen to be of the inert type, which
provides a viable dark matter candidate. The mixing of the Higgs doublets with
the flavon field, can provide plenty of interesting signals, including: i)
small corrections to the couplings of the SM-like Higgs, ii) exotic signals
from the flavon fields, iii) new signatures from the heavy Higgs bosons. These
aspects are studied within a specific model with 3+1 Higgs doublets and a
singlet FN field. Constraints on the model are derived from the study of K and
D mixing and the Higgs search at the LHC. For last, the implications from the
latter aforementioned constraints to the FCNC top decay $t\to ch$ are presented
too.

allow prioritized defaults. For any given goal, tentative plans created in the
HL using default knowledge and commonsense reasoning are implemented in the LL
using probabilistic algorithms, with the corresponding observations used to
update the HL history. Tight coupling between the two levels enables automatic
selection of relevant variables and generation of suitable action policies in
the LL for each HL action, and supports reasoning with violation of defaults,
noisy observations and unreliable actions in large and complex domains. The
architecture is evaluated in simulation and on physical robots transporting
objects in indoor domains; the benefit on robots is a reduction in task
execution time of 39% compared with a purely probabilistic, but still

Indeed, they force solutions of variational problems to belong to a
low-dimensional manifold (the so-called model) which is stable under small
perturbations of the function. This property is crucial to make the underlying
low-complexity model robust to small noise. We show that a generalized
""irrepresentable condition"" implies stable model selection under small noise
perturbations in the observations and the design matrix, when the
regularization parameter is tuned proportionally to the noise level. This
condition is shown to be almost a necessary condition. We then show that this
condition implies model consistency of the regularized estimator. That is, with
a probability tending to one as the number of measurements increases, the
regularized estimator belongs to the correct low-dimensional model manifold.
This work unifies and generalizes several previous ones, where model

similarity to one designed for preserving Euclidean distance, the original
features should be normalized by mapping them to the unit hypersphere before
learning the binary mapping functions. To compare a method whose goal is to
preserves Euclidean distance to one that preserves cosine similarity, the
original feature data must be mapped to a higher dimension by including a bias
term in binary mapping functions. These conditions ensure the fair comparison
between different binary code methods for the task of nearest neighbor search.

filaments and dense cores. Using numerical simulation we follow the non-linear
evolution of a perturbed equilibrium layer. The linear evolution of such a
layer is described in the analytic work of Nagai et al (1998). We find that
filaments and dense cores form simultaneously. Depending on the initial
magnetic field, the resulting filaments form either a spiderweb-like network
(for weak magnetic fields) or a network of parallel filaments aligned
perpendicular to the magnetic field lines (for strong magnetic fields).
Although the filaments are radially collapsing, the density profile of their
central region (up to the thermal scale height) can be approximated by a
hydrodynamical equilibrium density structure. Thus, the magnetic field does not
play a significant role in setting the density distribution of the filaments.
The density distribution outside of the central region deviates from the
equilibrium. The radial column density distribution is then flatter than the
expected power law of $r^{-4}$ and similar to filament profiles observed with
Herschel. Our results does not explain the near constant filament width of
$\sim 0.1$pc. However, our model does not include turbulent motions. It is
expected that accretion-driven amplification of these turbulent motions
provides additional support within the filaments against gravitational
collapse. Finally, we interpret the filamentary network of the massive star
forming complex G14.225-0.506 in terms of the gravitational instability model
and find that the properties of the complex are consistent with being formed
out of an unstable layer threaded by a strong, parallel magnetic field.

The voters can cast partisan ballots for two political powers the executive
(Presidential elections) and the legislative (the Congress election). Some
recent studies have shown that many voters tend to shape their preferences for
the political parties by choosing different parties in these two election
contests. This type of behavior referred to by Smith et al. (1999) as ""ticket
splitting"" shows irrationality of behavior (such as preference reversal) from
the perspective of traditional decision making theories (Von Neumann and
Morgenstern (1953), Savage, (1954)). It has been shown by i.e. Zorn and Smith
(2011) and also Khrennikova et al. (2014) that these types of ""non-separable""
preferences are context dependent and can be well accommodated in a quantum
like framework. In this paper we use data from Smith et al. (1999) to show
first of all probabilistic violation of classical (Kolmogorovian) framework. We
proceed with the depiction of our observables (the Congress and the
Presidential contexts) with the aid of the quantum probability formula that
incorporates the ""contextuality"" of the decision making process through the
interference term. Statistical data induces an interference term of large
magnitude a so called hyperbolic interference. We perform with help of our
transition probabilities a state reconstruction of the voters state vectors to
test for the applicability of the generalized Born rule. This state can be
mathematically represented in the generalized Hilbert space based on
hyper-complex numbers.

revealed details of the stripping process, i.e., the truncation of all
interstellar medium (ISM) phases and of star formation (SF) in the disk, and
multiphase star-forming tails. Some stripped galaxies, in particular in merging
clusters, develop spectacular star-forming tails, giving them a jellyfish-like
appearance. In merging clusters, merger shocks in the intra-cluster medium
(ICM) are thought to have overrun these galaxies, enhancing the ambient ICM
pressure and thus triggering SF, gas stripping and tail formation. We present
idealised hydrodynamical simulations of this scenario, including standard
descriptions for SF and stellar feedback. To aid the interpretation of recent
and upcoming observations, we focus on particular structures and dynamics in SF
patterns in the remaining gas disk and in the near tails, which are easiest to
observe. The observed jellyfish morphology is qualitatively reproduced for,
both, face-on and edge-on stripping. In edge-on stripping, the interplay
between the ICM wind and the disk rotation leads to asymmetries along the ICM
wind direction and perpendicular to it. The apparent tail is still part of a
highly deformed gaseous and young stellar disk. In both geometries, SF takes
place in knots throughout the tail, such that the stars in the tails show no
ordered age gradients. Significant SF enhancement in the disk occurs only at
radii where the gas will be stripped in due course.

Portal. We realize this setup in the \emph{dark mediator Dark matter} model
(dmDM), featuring a fermionic DM candidate $\chi$ with Yukawa couplings to
light scalars $\phi_i$. The scalars couple to SM quarks via the operator $\bar
q q \phi_i^* \phi_j/\Lambda_{ij}$. This can lead to large direct detection
signals via the $2\rightarrow3$ process $\chi N \rightarrow \chi N \phi$ if one
of the scalars has mass $ \lesssim 10$ keV. For dark matter Yukawa couplings
$y_\chi \sim 10^{-3} - 10^{-2}$, dmDM features a thermal relic dark matter
candidate while also implementing the SIDM scenario for ameliorating
inconsistencies between dwarf galaxy simulations and observations. We undertake
the first systematic survey of constraints on light scalars coupled to the SM
via the above operator. The strongest constraints are derived from a detailed
examination of the light mediator's effects on stellar astrophysics. LHC
experiments and cosmological considerations also yield important bounds.
Observations of neutron star cooling exclude the minimal model with one dark
mediator, but a scenario with two dark mediators remains viable and can give
strong direct detection signals. We explore the direct detection consequences
of this scenario and find that a heavy $\mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV dmDM candidate
fakes different $\mathcal{O}(10)$ GeV WIMPs at different experiments. Large
regions of dmDM parameter space are accessible above the irreducible neutrino
background.

parts. As a first step, we consider the properties of a many-body localized
system coupled to a generic ergodic bath whose characteristic dynamical
timescales are much slower than those of the system. As we discuss, a wide
range of experimentally relevant systems fall into this class; we argue that
relaxation in these systems is dominated by collective many-particle
rearrangements, and compute the associated timescales and spectral broadening.
We then use the observation that the self-consistent environment of any region
in a nearly localized metal can itself be modeled as a slowly fluctuating bath
to outline a self-consistent mean-field description of the nearly localized
metal and the localization transition. In the nearly localized regime, the
spectra of local operators are highly inhomogeneous and the typical local
spectral linewidth is narrow. The local spectral linewidth is proportional to
the DC conductivity, which is small in the nearly localized regime. This
typical linewidth and the DC conductivity go to zero as the localized phase is
approached, with a scaling that we calculate, and which appears to be in good
agreement with recent experimental results.

formation in low-mass halos at early times, while local dwarf galaxy counts
tell us that star formation has been minimal in small halos around us today.
Using simple models and the ELVIS simulation suite, we show that reionization
scenarios requiring appreciable star formation in halos with $M_{\rm vir}
\approx 10^{8}\,M_{\odot}$ at $z=8$ are in serious tension with galaxy counts
in the Local Group. This tension originates from the seemingly inescapable
conclusion that 30 - 60 halos with $M_{\rm vir} > 10^{8}\,M_{\odot}$ at $z=8$
will survive to be distinct bound satellites of the Milky Way at $z = 0$.
Reionization models requiring star formation in such halos will produce dozens
of bound galaxies in the Milky Way's virial volume today (and 100 - 200
throughout the Local Group), each with $\gtrsim 10^{5}\,M_{\odot}$ of old stars
($\gtrsim 13$ Gyr). This exceeds the stellar mass function of classical Milky
Way satellites today, even without allowing for the (significant)
post-reionization star formation observed in these galaxies. One possible
implication of these findings is that star formation became sharply inefficient
in halos smaller than $\sim 10^9 \,M_{\odot}$ at early times, implying that the
high-$z$ luminosity function must break at magnitudes brighter than is often
assumed (at ${\rm M_{UV}} \approx -14$). Our results suggest that JWST (and
possibly even HST with the Frontier Fields) may realistically detect the
faintest galaxies that drive reionization. It remains to be seen how these
results can be reconciled with the most sophisticated simulations of early
galaxy formation at present, which predict substantial star formation in
$M_{\rm vir} \sim 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$ halos during the epoch of reionization.

Schwarzschild-AdS$_{d+1}$ background via a dipole (Pauli) coupling sourced by a
probe gauge field. We find quite generally that a gap forms in the dual
operator spectrum as the Pauli coupling is strengthened. Previous
investigations have observed this behavior in analogous constructions with
Reissner-Nordstr\""om-AdS (RN-AdS$_4$) backgrounds, but the emergence of
log-oscillatory behavior in those models' spectra prevented identification of
the underlying gapping mechanism. Our model obviates this issue through its
modified geometry and traces the gapping mechanism back to the bulk dynamics.
We show in general that there is a duality between zeros for large positive
values of the coupling and poles in the spectrum for equivalent couplings but
with opposite sign as seen recently in the RN-AdS$_4$ background\cite{alsup}.
The duality arises from the two possible quantizations for computing the
retarded propagator. Coupled with the earlier string
results\cite{gauntlett,gubser2} that Fermi surfaces are generally absent from
the spectral function, our finding that the Pauli term engineers the gap
suggests that the model examined here offers a way of studying non-perturbative

respectively. The peak luminosity is a steep function of progenitor mass, L
M^(2-3). This very roughly parallels the scaling of luminosity with mass on the
main sequence, but the transients are ~2000-4000 times more luminous at peak.
Combining these, the mass function of the progenitors, dN/dM M^(-2.0+/-0.8), is
consistent with the initial mass function, albeit with broad uncertainties.
These observational results are also broadly consistent with the estimates of
binary population synthesis models. While extragalactic variability surveys can
better define the rates and properties of the high luminosity events,
systematic, moderate depth (I>16 mag) surveys of the Galactic plane are needed
to characterize the low luminosity events. The existing Galactic samples are
only ~20% complete and Galactic surveys are (at best) reaching a typical
magnitude limit of <13 mag.

environments have low specific star formation rates, i.e. they are quenched.
Based on cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include a prescription
where quenching occurs in regions dominated by hot (>10^5 K) gas, we argue that
this hot gas quenching in halos >10^12 Msun drives both mass quenching (i.e.
central quenching) and environment quenching (i.e. satellite quenching). These
simulations reproduce a broad range of locally observed trends among quenching,
halo mass, stellar mass, environment, and distance to halo center. We show that
mass quenching is independent of environment because 10^12-10^13 Msun
""quenching halos"" -- those where most mass quenching occurs -- inhabit a large
range of environments. On the other hand, environment quenching is independent
of stellar mass because galaxies of all stellar masses may live in dense
environments as satellites of groups and clusters. Furthermore, satellite
galaxies show signs of mass quenching independent of halo mass because massive
satellites at z=0 have typically been mass quenched as centrals in their own
hot halos at higher z -- a kind of pre-processing. As in observations, the
fraction of quenched satellites increases with halo mass and decreases with
distance to the center of the group or cluster. We investigate quenched
centrals in low-mass halos (<10^12 Msun), and show that most of these are
ejected former satellites of groups or clusters, while about 20 per cent were
never satellites but are enveloped in hot gas that extends up to 3 Rvir from
the centers of clusters. The agreement of our model with key observational
trends suggests that hot gas in massive halos plays a leading role in quenching
low-redshift galaxies.

extract rotational energy and angular momentum from the hole. This intriguing
phenomenon is known as superradiant scattering. As pointed out by Press and
Teukolsky, the black-hole-field system can be made unstable (explosive) by
placing a reflecting mirror around the black hole which prevents the extracted
energy from escaping to infinity. This composed black-hole-mirror-field bomb
has been studied extensively by many researchers. It is worth noting, however,
that most former studies of the black-hole bomb phenomenon have focused on the
specific case of confined scalar (spin-$0$) fields. In the present study we
explore the physical properties of the higher-spin (electromagnetic and
gravitational) black-hole bombs. It is shown that this composed system is
amenable to an analytic treatment in the physically interesting regime of
rapidly-rotating black holes. In particular, we prove that the composed
black-hole-mirror-field bomb is characterized by the unstable resonance
frequency $\omega=m\Omega_{\text{H}}+is\cdot 2\pi T_{\text{BH}}$ (here $s$ and
$m$ are respectively the spin-parameter and the azimuthal harmonic index of the
field, and $\Omega_{\text{H}}$ and $T_{\text{BH}}$ are respectively the
angular-velocity and the temperature of the rapidly-spinning black hole). Our
results provide evidence that the higher-spin (electromagnetic and
gravitational) black-hole-mirror bombs are much more explosive than the
extensively studied scalar black-hole-mirror bomb. In particular, it is shown
here that the instability growth rates which characterize the higher-spin
black-hole bombs are two orders of magnitudes larger than the instability
growth rate of the scalar black-hole bomb.

of SF sources including jellyfish galaxies with substantial unobscured SF due
to extreme stripping (SFR{UV}/SFR{IR} up to 3.3). The orientation of the trail,

population that can test ideas about quasar evolution as well as orientation,

identify such a population we match the quasar catalogues of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS), the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) to the
Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) to identify quasars with extremely
high infrared-to-optical ratios. We identify 65 objects with r(AB)-W4(Vega)>14
mag (i.e., F_nu(22um)/F_nu(r) > ~1000). This sample spans a redshift range of
0.28<z<4.36 and has a bimodal distribution, with peaks at z~0.8 and z~2.5. It
includes three z>2.6 objects that are detected in the W4-band but not W1 or W2
(i.e., W1W2-dropouts). The SDSS/BOSS spectra show that the majority of the
objects are reddened Type 1 quasars, Type 2 quasars (both at low and high
redshift) or objects with deep low-ionization broad absorption lines (BALs)
that suppress the observed r-band flux. In addition, we identify a class of
Type 1 permitted broad-emission line objects at z~2-3 which are characterized
by emission line rest-frame equivalent widths (REWs) of >~150Ang , much larger
than those of typical quasars. In particular, 55% (45%) of the non-BAL Type 1s
with measurable CIV in our sample have REW(CIV) > 100 (150)Ang, compared to
only 5.8% (1.3%) for non-BAL quasars in BOSS. These objects often also have
unusual line ratios, such as very high NV/Ly-alpha ratios. These large REWs
might be caused by suppressed continuum emission analogous to Type 2 quasars;
however, there is no obvious mechanism in standard Unified Models to suppress
the continuum without also obscuring the broad emission lines.

samples selected using the popular ""dropout"" technique, typically consisting of
UV-bright galaxies with blue colors and prominent Lyman breaks. As it is
currently unknown if these galaxies are representative of the massive galaxy
population, we here use the FourStar Galaxy Evolution (ZFOURGE) Survey to
create a stellar mass-limited sample at $z=3-4$. Uniquely, ZFOURGE uses deep
near-infrared medium-bandwidth filters to derive accurate photometric redshifts
and stellar population properties. The mass-complete sample consists of 57
galaxies with log M $>10.6$, reaching below $M^{\star}$ at $z=3-4$.
  On average, the massive $z=3-4$ galaxies are extremely faint in the observed
optical with median $R_{tot}^{AB}=27.48\pm0.41$ (restframe
$M_{1700}=-18.05\pm0.37$). They lie far below the UV luminosity-stellar mass
relation for Lyman break galaxies and are about $\sim100\times$ fainter at the
same mass. The massive galaxies are red ($R-Ks_{AB}=3.9\pm0.2$; restframe
UV-slope $\beta=-0.2\pm0.3$) likely from dust or old stellar ages. We classify
the galaxy SEDs by their restframe $U-V$ and $V-J$ colors and find a diverse
population: $46^{+6+10}_{-6-17}$% of the massive galaxies are quiescent,
$54^{+8+17}_{-8-10}$% are dusty star-forming galaxies, and only
$14^{+3+10}_{-3-4}$% resemble luminous blue star forming Lyman break galaxies.
This study clearly demonstrates an inherent diversity among massive galaxies at
higher redshift than previously known. Furthermore,we uncover a reservoir of
dusty star-forming galaxies with $4\times$ lower specific star-formation rates
compared to submillimeter-selected starbursts at $z>3$. With $5\times$ higher
numbers, the dusty galaxies may represent a more typical mode of star formation
compared to submillimeter-bright starbursts.

(SFR)-density relation at z=1 from that at z=0 (e.g. Elbaz et al.; Cooper et
al.), while the sign of the slope of the color-density relation remains
unchanged (e.g. Cucciati et al.; Quadri et al.). We use state-of-the-art
adaptive mesh refinement cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of a 21x24x20
(Mpc/h)$^3$ region centered on a cluster to examine the SFR-density and
color-density relations of galaxies at z=0 and z=1. The local environmental
density is defined by the dark matter mass in spheres of radius 1 Mpc/h, and we
probe two decades of environmental densities. Our simulations produce a large
increase of SFR with density at z=1, as in the observations of Elbaz et al. We
also find a significant evolution to z=0, where the SFR-density relation is
much flatter. The color-density relation in our simulations is consistent from
z=1 to z=0, in agreement with observations. We find that the increase in the
median SFR with local density at z=1 is due to a growing population of
star-forming galaxies in higher-density environments. At z=0 and z=1 both the
SFR and cold gas mass are tightly correlated with the galaxy halo mass, and
therefore the correlation between median halo mass and local density is an
important cause of the SFR-density relation at both redshifts. We also show
that the local density on 1 Mpc/h scales affects galaxy SFRs as much as halo
mass at z=0. Finally, we find indications that the role of the 1 Mpc/h scale
environment reverses from z=0 to z=1: at z=0 high-density environments depress
galaxy SFRs, while at z=1 high-density environments tend to increase SFRs.

bursts in the frequency range 64 Hz-1792 Hz associated with gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs), using data from GEO600 and one of the LIGO or Virgo detectors. We
introduce the method of a linear search grid to analyse GRB events with large
sky localisation uncertainties such as the localisations provided by the Fermi
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). Coherent searches for gravitational waves (GWs)
can be computationally intensive when the GRB sky position is not
well-localised, due to the corrections required for the difference in arrival
time between detectors. Using a linear search grid we are able to reduce the
computational cost of the analysis by a factor of O(10) for GBM events.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that our analysis pipeline can improve upon the sky
localisation of GRBs detected by the GBM, if a high-frequency GW signal is
observed in coincidence. We use the linear search grid method in a search for
GWs associated with 129 GRBs observed satellite-based gamma-ray experiments
between 2006 and 2011. The GRBs in our sample had not been previously analysed
for GW counterparts. A fraction of our GRB events are analysed using data from
GEO600 while the detector was using squeezed-light states to improve its
sensitivity; this is the first search for GWs using data from a squeezed-light
interferometric observatory. We find no evidence for GW signals, either with
any individual GRB in this sample or with the population as a whole. For each
GRB we place lower bounds on the distance to the progenitor, assuming a fixed
GW emission energy of $10^{-2} M_{\odot}c^{2}$, with a median exclusion
distance of 0.8 Mpc for emission at 500 Hz and 0.3 Mpc at 1 kHz. The reduced
computational cost associated with a linear search grid will enable rapid
searches for GWs associated with Fermi GBM events in the Advanced detector era.

time, on detector magnetization, and on the systematic uncertainties achievable
with and without a near detector. We find that a 35 kt far detector in DUNE

They
strongly modify the radiative transfer in stars, therefore impacting their
physical structure. Ultimately, most of our knowledge of stellar population
systems (stars, clusters, galaxies, etc.) relies on the accuracy with which we
understand and reproduce the stellar spectra. With such a wide impact on
Astronomy, it would be ideal to have access to a complete, accurate and precise
list of atomic transitions. This, unfortunately, is not the case. Few atomic
transitions had their parameters actually measured in the laboratory, and for
most of the lines the parameters were calculated with low precision atomic
energy levels. Only a small fraction of the lines were calibrated empirically.
For the purpose of computing a stellar spectral grid with a complete coverage
of spectral types and luminosity classes, this situation is rather limiting. We
have implemented an innovative method to perform a robust calibration of atomic
line lists used by spectral synthesis codes called ALiCCE: Atomic Lines
Calibration using the Cross-Entropy algorithm. Here we describe the
implementation and validation of the method, using synthetic spectra which
simulates the signal-to-noise, spectral resolution and rotational velocities
typical of high quality observed spectra. We conclude that the method is
efficient for calibrating atomic line lists.

observational and theoretical investigations. GJ3470b is a warm uranus recently
detected in transit across a bright late-type star. The transit of this planet
has already been observed in several band passes from the ground and space,
allowing observers to draw an intriguing yet incomplete transmission spectrum
of the planet atmospheric limb. In particular, published data in the visible
suggest the existence of a Rayleigh scattering slope, making GJ3470b a unique
case among the known neptunes, while data obtained beyond 2 um are consistent
with a flat infrared spectrum. The unexplored near-infrared spectral region
between 1 and 2 um, is thus key to undertanding the atmospheric nature of
GJ3470b. Here, we report on the first space-borne spectrum of GJ3470, obtained
during one transit of the planet with WFC3 on board HST, operated in stare
mode. The spectrum covers the 1.1--1.7-um region with a resolution of about
300. We retrieve the transmission spectrum of GJ3470b with a chromatic
planet-to-star radius ratio precision of 0.15% (about one scale height) per
40-nm bins. At this precision, the spectrum appears featureless, in good
agreement with ground-based and Spitzer infrared data at longer wavelengths,
pointing to a flat transmission spectrum from 1 to 5 um. We present new
simulations of transmission spectra for GJ3470b, which allow us to show that
the HST/WFC3 observations rule out cloudless hydrogen-rich atmospheres (>10
sigma) as well as hydrogen-rich atmospheres with tholin haze (>5 sigma). Adding
our near-infrared measurements to the full set of previously published data
from 0.3 to 5 um, we find that a cloudy, hydrogen-rich atmosphere can explain
the full transmission spectrum if, at the terminator, the clouds are located at
low pressures (<1 mbar) or the water mixing ratio is extremely low (<1 ppm).

""joinability"") problems for bipartite quantum states and channels. This
includes well known extension problems such as optimal quantum cloning and
quantum marginal problems as special instances. Central to our generalization
is a variant of the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism between bipartite states and
dynamical maps which we term the ""homocorrelation map"": while the former
emphasizes the preservation of the positivity constraint, the latter is
designed to preserve statistical correlations, allowing direct contact with
entanglement. In particular, we define and analyze state-joining,
channel-joining, and local-positive joining problems in three-party settings
exhibiting collective UxUxU symmetry, obtaining exact analytical
characterizations in low dimension. Suggestively, we find that bipartite
quantum states are limited in the degree to which their measurement outcomes
may agree, while quantum channels are limited in the degree to which their
measurement outcomes may disagree. Loosely speaking, quantum mechanics enforces
an upper bound on the extent of positive correlation across a bipartite system
at a given time, as well as on the extent of negative correlation between the
state of a same system across two instants of time. We argue that these general
statistical bounds inform the quantum joinability limitations, and show that
they are in fact sufficient for the three-party UxUxU-invariant setting.

sources transmit simultaneously their signals to multiple destinations with the
help of a full-duplex relay station. We assume that the relay station is
equipped with massive arrays, while all sources and destinations have a single
antenna. The relay station uses channel estimates obtained from received pilots
and zero-forcing (ZF) or maximum-ratio combining/maximum-ratio transmission
(MRC/MRT) to process the signals. To reduce significantly the loop interference
effect, we propose two techniques: i) using a massive receive antenna array; or
ii) using a massive transmit antenna array together with very low transmit
power at the relay station. We derive an exact achievable rate in closed-form
for MRC/MRT processing and an analytical approximation of the achievable rate
for ZF processing. This approximation is very tight, especially for large
number of relay station antennas. These closed-form expressions enable us to
determine the regions where the full-duplex mode outperforms the half-duplex
mode, as well as, to design an optimal power allocation scheme. This optimal
power allocation scheme aims to maximize the energy efficiency for a given sum
spectral efficiency and under peak power constraints at the relay station and
sources. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the optimal power
allocation scheme. Furthermore, we show that, by doubling the number of
transmit/receive antennas at the relay station, the transmit power of each
source and of the relay station can be reduced by 1.5dB if the pilot power is
equal to the signal power, and by 3dB if the pilot power is kept fixed, while
maintaining a given quality-of-service.

attractive research topic. Here, we demonstrate that the tunnel magneto-Seebeck
effect (TMS) in CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB tunnel junctions can be switched on to a logic
1 state and off to 0 by simply changing the magnetic state of the CoFeB
electrodes. We enable this new functionality of magnetic tunnel junctions by
combining a thermal gradient and an electric field. This new technique unveils
the bias-enhanced tunnel magneto-Seebeck effect, which can serve as the basis
for logic devices or memories in a green information technology with a pure
thermal write and read process. Furthermore, the thermally generated voltages
that are referred to as the Seebeck effect are well known to sensitively depend
on the electronic structure and therefore have been valued in solid-state
physics for nearly one hundred years. Here, we lift Seebeck's historic
discovery from 1821 to a new level of current spintronics. Our results show
that the signal crosses zero and can be adjusted by tuning a bias voltage that
is applied between the electrodes of the junction; hence, the name of the
effect is bias-enhanced tunnel magneto-Seebeck effect (bTMS). Via the spin- and
energy-dependent transmission of electrons in the junction, the bTMS effect can
be configured using the bias voltage with much higher control than the tunnel
magnetoresistance (TMR) and even completely suppressed for only one magnetic
configuration, which is either parallel (P) or anti-parallel (AP). This option
allows a readout contrast for the magnetic information of -3000% at room
temperature while maintaining a large signal for one magnetic orientation. This
contrast is much larger than the value that can be obtained using the TMR
effect. Moreover, our measurements are a step towards the experimental
realization of high TMS ratios, which are predicted for specific Co-Fe

spherically symmetric, scale-free potentials. The Hamiltonian is a power-law or
logarithmic function of a linear combination of the actions. Our expression
reduces to the well-known results for the familiar cases of the harmonic
oscillator and the Kepler potential. For other power-laws, as well as for the
singular isothermal sphere, it is exact for the radial and circular orbits, and
very accurate for general orbits. Numerical tests show that the errors are
always small, with mean errors across a grid of actions always less than 1 %
and maximum errors less than 2.5 %. Simple first-order corrections can reduce
mean errors to less than 0.6 % and maximum errors to less than 1 %. We use our
new result to show that :[1] the misalignment angle between debris in a stream
and a progenitor is always very nearly zero in spherical scale-free potentials,
demonstrating that streams can be sometimes well approximated by orbits, [2]
the effects of an adiabatic change in the stellar density profile in the inner
regions of a galaxy weaken any existing 1/r density cusp, which is reduced to
$1/r^{1/3}$. More generally, we derive the full range of adiabatic cusp
transformations and show how to relate the starting cusp index to the final
cusp index. It follows that adiabatic transformations can never erase a dark
matter cusp.

pristine dielectrics on metal substrates, which is essential to many electronic
devices. Tunnel junctions are an excellent example which require a leak-free,
ultrathin dielectric tunnel barrier of typical thickness around 1 nm between
two metal electrodes. A challenge in the development of ultrathin dielectric
tunnel barrier using ALD is controlling the nucleation of dielectrics on metals
with minimal formation of native oxides at the metal surface for high-quality
interfaces between the tunnel barrier and metal electrodes. This poses a
critical need for integrating ALD with ultra-high vacuum (UHV) physical vapor
deposition. In order to address these challenges, a viscous-flow ALD chamber
was designed and interfaced to an UHV magnetron sputtering chamber via a load
lock. A sample transportation system was implemented for in situ sample
transfer between the ALD, load lock, and sputtering chambers. Using this
integrated ALD-UHV sputtering system, superconductor-insulator-superconductor
(SIS) Nb/Al/Al2O3/Nb Josephson tunnel junctions were fabricated with tunnel
barriers of thickness varied from sub-nm to ~ 1 nm. The suitability of using an
Al wetting layer for initiation of the ALD Al2O3 tunnel barrier was
investigated with ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy, and electrical
transport measurements. With optimized processing conditions, leak-free SIS
tunnel junctions were obtained, demonstrating the viability of this integrated
ALD-UHV sputtering system for the fabrication of tunnel junctions and devices
comprised of metal-dielectric-metal multilayers.

Data Release 9, and compare with mock spectra that include careful modeling of
the noise, continuum, and astrophysical uncertainties. The BOSS transmission
PDFs, measured at $\langle z \rangle = [2.3,2.6,3.0]$, are compared with PDFs
created from mock spectra drawn from a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that
sample the IGM temperature-density relationship, $\gamma$, and temperature at
mean-density, $T_0$, where $T(\Delta) = T_0 \Delta^{\gamma-1}$. We find that a
significant population of partial Lyman-limit systems with a column-density
distribution slope of $\beta_\mathrm{pLLS} \sim -2$ are required to explain the
data at the low-transmission end of transmission PDF, while uncertainties in
the mean Ly$\alpha$ forest transmission affect the high-transmission end. After
modelling the LLSs and marginalizing over mean-transmission uncertainties, we
find that $\gamma=1.6$ best describes the data over our entire redshift range,

our model framework, isothermal or inverted temperature-density relationships

dependence of these quantities we show the existence of some particular basis
(we will call them conformal basis) whose finite-size scaling function is
related to the central charge
  $c$ of the underlying conformal field theory of the model.
  In particular, we verified that for large index $n$, the MI of a subsystem of
size $\ell$ in a periodic chain with $L$ sites behaves as
$\frac{c}{4}\frac{n}{n-1}\ln\Big{(}\frac{L}{\pi}\sin(\frac{\pi

our numerical data, in general there is no direct relation between $b_n$ and

propose a flexible framework for time-varying adaptive filtering of seismic

the joint estimation of adaptive filters and primaries in a new convex
variational formulation. This approach allows us to incorporate plausible
knowledge about noise statistics, data sparsity and slow filter variation in
parsimony-promoting wavelet frames. The designed primal-dual algorithm solves a
constrained minimization problem that alleviates standard regularization issues
in finding hyperparameters. The approach demonstrates significantly good
performance in low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, both for simulated and

the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA) and the European VLBI Network
(EVN) from February 2011 to October 2012, together with contemporaneous
high-energy gamma-ray light curves obtained by the Fermi-LAT. During this
period, an elevated level of the M87 flux is reported at VHE gamma rays. We
detected a remarkable increase of the radio flux density from the unresolved
jet base (radio core) with VERA at 22 and 43GHz coincident with the VHE
activity. Meanwhile, we confirmed with EVN at 5GHz that HST-1 (an alternative
gamma-ray production candidate site) remained quiescent in terms of its flux
density and structure. These results in the radio bands strongly suggest that
the VHE gamma-ray activity in 2012 originates in the jet base within 0.03pc or
56 Schwarzschild radii from the central supermassive black hole. We further
conducted VERA astrometry for the M87 core during the flaring period, and
detected core shifts between 22 and 43GHz. We also discovered a clear
frequency-dependent evolution of the radio core flare at 43, 22 and 5GHz; the
radio flux density increased more rapidly at higher frequencies with a larger
amplitude, and the light curves clearly showed a time-lag between the peaks at
22 and 43GHz. This indicates that a new radio-emitting component was created
near the black hole in the period of the VHE event, and then propagated outward
with progressively decreasing synchrotron opacity. By combining these results,
we estimated an apparent speed of the newborn component, and derived a
sub-luminal speed of less than ~0.2c. This value is significantly slower than
the super-luminal (~1.1c) features that appeared from the core during the
prominent VHE flaring event in 2008, suggesting that the stronger VHE activity
can be associated with the production of the higher Lorentz factor jet.

30 multiple stars with early-type components. In this second paper we present
the results of six multiple systems in which new stellar components have been
detected.
  Aims. The main aim is to increase the knowledge of stellar properties and
dynamical structure of early-type multiple stellar systems.
  Methods. Using spectroscopic observations taken over a time baseline of more
than 5 years we measured RVs by cross-correlations and applied a spectral
disentangling method to double-lined systems. Besides the discovery of objects
with double-lined spectra, the existence of new spectroscopic subsystems have
been inferred from the radial velocity variations of single-lined components
and through the variation of the barycentric velocity of double-lined
subsystems. Orbital elements have been calculated when possible.
  Results. Seven new stellar components and two members that we expect to
confirm with new observations have been discovered in the six studied
multiples. We present orbital parameters for two double-lined binaries and
preliminary orbits for three single-lined spectroscopic binaries. Five of the
six analysed systems are quadruples, while the remaining has five components
distributed in four hierarchical levels. These multiplicity orders are in fact
lower limits, since these systems lack high-resolution visual observations and
additional hierarchical level might exist in that separation range.
  Conclusions. The six analysed systems have greater multiplicity degree and a
more complex hierarchical structure than previously known, which suggests that
high-order multiple systems are significantly more frequent that it is
currently estimated. The long term spectroscopic monitoring of multiple systems
has shown to be useful for the detection of companions in intermediate
hierarchical levels.

Cluster of StarS (EMACSS). While previous versions of EMACSS reproduced
clusters of single-mass stars, this version models clusters with an evolving
stellar content. Stellar evolution dominates early evolution, and leads to: (1)
reduction of the mean mass of stars due to the mass loss of high-mass stars;
(2) expansion of the half-mass radius; (3) for (nearly) Roche Volume filling
clusters, the induced escape of stars. Once sufficient relaxation has occurred
(~ 10 relaxation times-scales), clusters reach a second, 'balanced' state
whereby the core releases energy as required by the cluster as a whole. In this
state: (1) stars escape due to tidal effects faster than before balanced
evolution; (2) the half-mass radius expands or contracts depending on the Roche
volume filling factor; and (3) the mean mass of stars increases due to the
preferential ejection of low-mass stars.
  We compare the EMACSS results of several cluster properties against N-body
simulations of clusters spanning a range of initial number of stars, mass,
half-mass radius, and tidal environments, and show that our prescription
accurately predicts cluster evolution for this database. Finally, we consider
applications for EMACSS, such as studies of galactic globular cluster
populations in cosmological simulations.

present two results: 1) the linear sum DoF for MIMO XC with general antenna

rank-ratio inequality that characterizes the maximum ratio between the
dimensions of received linear subspaces at the two multiple-antenna receivers.
The achievability of the linear sum DoF is based on a three-phase strategy, in
which during the first two phases only the transmitter with fewer antennas
exploits delayed CSIT in order to minimize the dimension of its signal at the
unintended receiver. During Phase 3, both transmitters use delayed CSIT to send
linear combinations of past transmissions such that each receiver receives a
superposition of desired message data and known interference, thus
simultaneously serving both receivers. We also derive other linear DoF outer
bounds for the MIMO XC that, in addition to the outer bounds from the sum DoF
converse and the proposed transmission strategy, allow us to characterize the
linear DoF region for symmetric antenna configurations.

property that the reflector is semi-left-exact. In this article we first
determine an abstract characterization of the categories which are
semi-localizations of an exact Mal'tsev category, by specializing a result due
to S. Mantovani. We then turn our attention to semi-abelian categories, where a
special type of semi-localizations are known to coincide with torsion-free
subcategories. A new characterisation of protomodular categories in terms of
binary relations is obtained, inspired by the one discovered in the pointed
context by Z. Janelidze. This result is useful to obtain an abstract
characterization of the torsion-free and of the hereditarily-torsion-free
subcategories of semi-abelian categories. Some examples are considered in
detail in the categories of groups, crossed modules, commutative rings and
topological groups. We finally explain how these results extend similar ones
obtained by W. Rump in the abelian context.

one, Higgs decays to a Z boson and a new massive gauge boson, the so-called

vector-like fermion. We argue that the upcoming LHC run will be able to explore
a new parameter space of these models that is allowed by current precision

contained in the differential distribution of the 4-lepton final state to
extract the signal of exotic decays. We find that, in some cases, the LHC can
be sensitive to new physics even when the correction to the total 4-lepton

between reality and our observation of it are at the heart of both quantum
mechanics and the dynamical mechanism of physical systems. We suggest that the
origin of quantum uncertainty lies with the absence of infinities or
infinitesimals in observational data and that our concept of time derives from
observing changing data (events). We argue that the fundamentally important
content of the Superposition Principle is not the ""probability amplitude"" of
posterior state observation but future state availability conditional only on
prior information. Since event detection also implies posterior conditions
(e.g. a specific type of detectable event occurred) as well as prior
conditions, the probabilities of detected outcomes are also conditional on
properties of the posterior properties of the observation. Such posterior
conditions cannot affect the prior state availabilities and this implies
violation of counter-factual definiteness. A component of a quantum system may
be chosen to represent a clock and changes in other components can then be
expected to be correlated with clocks with which they are entangled. Instead of
traditional time-dependent equations of motion we provide a specific mechanism
whereby evolution of data is instead quasi-causally related to the relative
\availability\ of states and equations of motion are expressed in terms of
quantized clock variables. We also suggest that time-reversal symmetry-breaking
in weak interactions is an artifice of a conventional choice of co-ordinate
time-function. Analysis of a ""free"" particle suggests that conventional
co-ordinate space-time emerges from how we measure the separation of objects

  Interference Codebook at one Receiver",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In multi-user information theory it is often assumed that every node in the
network possesses all codebooks used in the network. This assumption may be
impractical in distributed ad-hoc, cognitive or heterogeneous networks. This
work considers the two-user Interference Channel with one Oblivious Receiver
(IC-OR), i.e., one receiver lacks knowledge of the interfering cookbook while
the other receiver knows both codebooks. The paper asks whether, and if so how
much, the channel capacity of the IC-OR is reduced compared to that of the
classical IC where both receivers know all codebooks. A novel outer bound is
derived and shown to be achievable to within a gap for the class of injective
semi-deterministic IC-ORs; the gap is shown to be zero for injective fully
deterministic IC-ORs. For the linear deterministic IC-OR that models the
Gaussian noise channel at high SNR, non i.i.d. Bernoulli(1/2) input bits are
shown to achieve points not achievable by i.i.d. Bernoulli(1/2) input bits used
in the same achievability scheme. For the real-valued Gaussian IC-OR the gap is
shown to be at most 1/2 bit per channel use, even though the set of optimal
input distributions for the derived outer bound could not be determined.
Towards understanding the Gaussian IC-OR, an achievability strategy is
evaluated in which the input alphabets at the non-oblivious transmitter are a
mixture of discrete and Gaussian random variables, where the cardinality of the
discrete part is appropriately chosen as a function of the channel parameters.
Surprisingly, as the oblivious receiver intuitively should not be able to
'jointly decode' the intended and interfering messages (whose codebook is
unavailable), it is shown that with this choice of input, the capacity region
of the symmetric Gaussian IC-OR is to within 3.34 bits (per channel use per
user) of an outer bound for the classical Gaussian IC with full codebook
knowledge.

superresolution techniques allow substantial, useful improvements beyond the

produces large amounts of cool ($T\lesssim 1\,{\rm MeV}$), unbound,
neutron-rich material ($M_{\rm ej}\sim 0.05M_\odot-0.20M_\odot$). A comparable
amount of bound matter is initially divided between a hot disk ($T_{\rm

10^{53}\,{\rm erg/s}$, and a cooler tidal tail. After a short period of rapid
protonization of the disk lasting $\sim 10\,{\rm ms}$, the accretion disk cools
down under the combined effects of the fall-back of cool material from the
tail, continued accretion of the hottest material onto the black hole, and
neutrino emission. As the temperature decreases, the disk progressively becomes
more neutron-rich, with dimmer neutrino emission. This cooling process should
stop once the viscous heating in the disk (not included in our simulations)
balances the cooling. These mergers of neutron star-black hole binaries with
black hole masses $M_{\rm BH}\sim 7M_\odot-10M_\odot$ and black hole spins high
enough for the neutron star to disrupt provide promising candidates for the

nonlinear wave equations on a mean field level. The interplay between disorder
and nonlinearity, their localizing and delocalizing effects is currently an
intriguing and challenging issue in the field. We will discuss recent advances
in the dynamics of nonlinear lattice waves in random potentials. In the absence
of nonlinear terms in the wave equations, Anderson localization is leading to a
halt of wave packet spreading.
  Nonlinearity couples localized eigenstates and, potentially, enables
spreading and destruction of Anderson localization due to nonintegrability,
chaos and decoherence. The spreading process is characterized by universal
subdiffusive laws due to nonlinear diffusion. We review extensive computational
studies for one- and two-dimensional systems with tunable nonlinearity power.
We also briefly discuss extensions to other cases where the linear wave

Specifically challenging are real-world environments where UAVs and other
network-enabled devices must communicate to coordinate---and communication
actions are neither reliable nor free. Such network-centric environments are
common in military, public safety and commercial applications, yet most
research (even multi-agent planning) usually takes communications among
distributed agents as a given. We address this challenge by developing an agent
architecture and reasoning algorithms based on Answer Set Programming (ASP).
ASP has been chosen for this task because it enables high flexibility of
representation, both of knowledge and of reasoning tasks. Although ASP has been
used successfully in a number of applications, and ASP-based architectures have
been studied for about a decade, to the best of our knowledge this is the first
practical application of a complete ASP-based agent architecture. It is also
the first practical application of ASP involving a combination of centralized
reasoning, decentralized reasoning, execution monitoring, and reasoning about
network communications. This work has been empirically validated using a
distributed network-centric software evaluation testbed and the results provide
guidance to designers in how to understand and control intelligent systems that
operate in these environments.

networks, storage networks, high performance computing networks and so on.
Along with the popularity of Ethernet comes the requirement of enhancing
Ethernet with congestion control. On the other hand, Ethernet speed extends to
40Gbps and 100Gbps recently, and even 400Gbps in the near future. The
ultra-high speed requires congestion control algorithms to adapt to the broad
changes of bandwidth, and highlights the impacts of small delay by enlarging
the bandwidth delay product. The state-of-art standard QCN is heuristically
designed for the 1Gbps and 10Gbps Ethernet, and unaware of the challenges
accompanying the ultra-high speed.
  To scale congestion control to ultra-high speed Ethernet, we propose the
Adaptive Sliding Mode (ASM) congestion control algorithm, which is simple,
stable, has fast and smooth convergence process, can tolerate the impacts of
delay and adapt to the wide changes of bandwidth. Real experiments and
simulations confirm these good properties and show that ASM outperforms QCN.
Designing ASM, we find that the derivative of queue length is helpful to rate
adjustment because it reflects the difference between bandwidth and aggregated
sending rate. We also argue for enforcing congestion control system staying at
the congestion boundary line, along which it automatically slides to stable
point. These insights are also valuable to develop other congestion control
algorithms in ultra-high speed networks.

sensitive to all forms and levels of non-Gaussianity that may be present in
observed CMB data. In recent works a statistical procedure based upon the
calculation of the skewness and kurtosis of the patches of CMB sky-sphere has
been proposed and used to find out significant large-angle deviation from
Gaussianity in the foreground-reduced WMAP maps. Here we address the question
as to how the analysis of Gaussianity of WMAP maps is modified if the
foreground-cleaned Planck maps are used, therefore extending and complementing
the previous analyses in several regards. We carry out a new analysis of
Gaussianity with the available nearly full-sky foreground-cleaned Planck maps.
As the foregrounds are cleaned through different component separation
procedures, each of the resulting Planck maps is then tested for Gaussianity.
We determine quantitatively the effects for Gaussianity of masking the
foreground-cleaned Planck maps with the INPMASK, VALMASK, and U73 Planck masks.
We show that although the foreground-cleaned Planck maps present significant
deviation from Gaussianity of different degrees when the less severe INPMASK
and VALMASK are used, they become consistent with Gaussianity as detected by
our indicator $S$ when masked with the union U73 mask. A slightly smaller
consistency with Gaussianity is found when the $K$ indicator is employed, which
seems to be associated with large-angle anomalies reported by the Planck team.
Finally, we examine the robustness of the Gaussianity analyses with respect to
the noise pixel's as given by the Planck team, and show that no appreciable
changes arise when is incorporated into the maps. The results of our analyses
provide important information about the suitability of the foreground-cleaned
Planck maps as Gaussian reconstructions of the CMB sky.

activity, $\rho(t) \sim t^{-\delta}$, with $\gamma = 1- \delta$. We verify that
at criticality, the activity correlation function $C(r) \sim
r^{-\beta/\nu_\perp}$, as expected at an absorbing-state phase transition. Our
results for critical exponents are consistent with, and somewhat more precise
than, predictions derived from the Langevin equation for stochastic sandpiles
in two dimensions.

conical jet are numerically solved by including escape, adiabatic and various
radiative losses. The radiative processes involved are synchrotron emission,
its self-Compton scattering, and inverse Compton scatterings of an accretion
disk and its surrounding stellar companion. This model also includes an
electromagnetic cascade process of an anisotropic $\gamma$-$\gamma$

emission spectral characteristic at different heights of the emission region

the synchrotron emission, the \emph{Fermi} LAT measurements by the synchrotron
emission and Comptonization of photons of the stellar companion, the TeV band
emission fluxes by the Comptonization of the stellar photons. Our results show
that: (1) Radio emission region extends from the binary system scales to the

distance close to the binary system scales. (3) The TeV band emissions could be
inside the binary system, and these emissions could be probed by the upcoming

polarized signal, are emitted inside the binary system. The location of the

In this paper, we study the
curvature properties for a large sample of Fermi/LAT bright blazars based on
quasi-simultaneous SED. Both SEDs of synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC)
components are fitted by a log-parabolic law in log_v-log_vfv diagram. The
second-degree term of log-parabola measures the curvature of SED. We find a
statistically significant correlation between synchrotron peak frequency and
its curvature. This result is in agreement with the theoretical prediction, and
confirms previous studies, which dealt with single source with various epoch
observations or a small sample. If a broken power-law is employed to fit the
SED, the difference between the two spectral indexes (alpha2-alpha1) can be
considered as a ""surrogate"" of the SED curvature. We collect spectral
parameters of a sample blazars from literature, and find a correlation between
the synchrotron peak frequency and the spectral difference. We do not find a
significant correlation between the IC peak frequency and its curvature, which
may be caused by complicated seed photon field. It is also found that the
synchrotron curvatures are on average larger than that of IC curvatures, and
there is no correlation between these two parameters. As suggested by previous
works in literature, both the log-parabolic law of SED and above correlation
can be explained by statistical and/or stochastic particle accelerations.
Stochastic particle acceleration predicts a different slope of the correlation
from that of statistical one, and our result seems favor stochastic
acceleration mechanisms and emission processes. Some of other evidences also
seem to support that the electron energy distribution (and/or synchrotron SED)

This signal would be the quantized version of the summation of the previously

quantization noise and the signal. To guarantee the independence of
quantization noise and signal, we extend the framework of lattice quantizers
with dither together with an interleaving step. For converse, we use the fact
that the capacity region of this problem is upper-bounded by the capacity
region of a physically degraded broadcast channel with no channel state

on the capacity region of this degraded broadcast channel. Finally, we show how

which the 126 GeV Higgs mixes with a singlet. In this case, a strongly first
order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT) is achieved by the tree-level
effects and the phase transition strength $\gamma_c$ is determined by the vacua
energy gap at $T=0$. We make an anatomy of the energy gap at both tree-level
and loop-level and extract out a dimensionless phase transition parameter
$R_\kappa \equiv 4 \kappa v_s / A_\kappa$, which can replace $A_\kappa$ in the
parameterization and affect the light CP odd and even Higgs spectra. We find
that SFOEWPT only occurs in $R_\kappa \sim -1$ and positive $R_\kappa \lesssim
\mathcal{O}(10)$, which in the non-PQ limit case would prefer either a
relatively light CP odd or CP even Higgs boson $\sim (60, 100)$ GeV, therefore
serves as a smoking gun signal and requires new search strategies at the LHC.

performance indicator, since the channel capacity grows linearly with the
available degrees of freedom. However, a fundamental question arises: given a
size limitation on the observable region, what is the intrinsic number of
degrees of freedom available in a wideband random multipath wavefield observed
over a finite time interval? In this paper, we focus on answering this question
by modelling the wavefield as a sum of orthogonal waveforms or spatial orders.
We show that for each spatial order, (i) the observable wavefield is band
limited within an effective bandwidth rather than the given bandwidth and (ii)
the observation time varies from the given observation time. These findings
show the strong coupling between space and time as well as space and bandwidth.
In effect, for spatially diverse multipath wavefields, the classical degrees of
freedom result of ""time-bandwidth"" product does not directly extend to
""time-space-bandwidth"" product.

to users based on instantaneous channel gains and short-term moving averages of

schedulers ignore the users' service history in previous cells and, thus,
cannot guarantee long-term Quality of Service (QoS) when users traverse
multiple cells with varying load and capacity. In this paper, we propose a new
Long-term Lookback Scheduling (LLS) framework, which extends conventional
short-term scheduling with long-term QoS information from previously traversed
cells. We demonstrate the application of LLS for common channel-aware, as well
as channel and queue-aware schedulers. The developed long-term schedulers also
provide a controllable trade-off between emphasizing the immediate user QoS or
the long-term measures. Our simulation results show high gains in long-term QoS
without sacrificing short-term user requirements. Therefore, the proposed
scheduling approach improves subscriber satisfaction and increases operational

first concentrate on a simple Bernoulli energy arrival process where at each

$p$, or no energy is harvested at all, independent of the other time steps. We
provide a near optimal energy control policy and a simple approximation to the
information-theoretic capacity of this channel. Our approximations for both

Our approximate capacity characterizations provide important insights for the
optimal design of energy harvesting communication systems in the regime where
both the battery size and the average energy arrival rate are large.

about million times larger than the sticking time derived from the surface Rb

usually involve operators that depend on a collection of continuous parameters.
When these operators enjoy some (local) regularity, these parameters can be
selected using the so-called Stein Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE). While this
selection is usually performed by exhaustive search, we address in this work
the problem of using the SURE to efficiently optimize for a collection of
continuous parameters of the model. When considering non-smooth regularizers,
such as the popular l1-norm corresponding to soft-thresholding mapping, the
SURE is a discontinuous function of the parameters preventing the use of
gradient descent optimization techniques. Instead, we focus on an approximation
of the SURE based on finite differences as proposed in (Ramani et al., 2008).
Under mild assumptions on the estimation mapping, we show that this
approximation is a weakly differentiable function of the parameters and its
weak gradient, coined the Stein Unbiased GrAdient estimator of the Risk
(SUGAR), provides an asymptotically (with respect to the data dimension)
unbiased estimate of the gradient of the risk. Moreover, in the particular case
of soft-thresholding, it is proved to be also a consistent estimator. This
gradient estimate can then be used as a basis to perform a quasi-Newton
optimization. The computation of the SUGAR relies on the closed-form (weak)
differentiation of the non-smooth function. We provide its expression for a
large class of iterative methods including proximal splitting ones and apply
our strategy to regularizations involving non-smooth convex structured
penalties. Illustrations on various image restoration and matrix completion
problems are given.

Majorana zero modes of a long-enough chain indeed have a parameter domain of
$2t>|\mu|$ as predicted from the bulk property of the chain, but a short chain
has a much smaller parameter domain than the prediction. Through a numerical
simulation Majorana zero modes are found to be robust under the disturbance of

applying a bias voltage on the quantum dot at an end of the chain. It is found
that for a weak coupling between a chain and a quantum dot the parity of the

The conserved quantity associated with time appears as a combination of the

written in terms of this conserved quantity, then the three-dimensional motion
in dRGT will not differ with respect to the same situation of Einstein gravity
(GR). The differences with respect to GR will appear whenever we have a

find differences between GR and dRGT.

dyadic of the resulting homogenized composite material (HCM) was estimated
using the Bruggeman homogenization formalism. The HCM was an orthorhombic
biaxial material if the symmetry axes of the two populations of spheroids were
mutually perpendicular and a uniaxial material if these two axes were mutually
aligned. The degree of anisotropy of the HCM, as gauged by the ratio of the
eigenvalues of the HCM's permittivity dyadic, increased as the shape of the
constituent particles became more eccentric. The greatest degrees of HCM
anisotropy were achieved for the limiting cases wherein the constituent
particles were shaped as needles or discs. In these instances explicit formulas
for the HCM anisotropy were derived from the dyadic Bruggeman equation. Using
these formulas it was found that the degrees of HCM anisotropy are proportional
to $\sqrt{\epsilon_b}$ or $\epsilon_b$, at fixed values of volume fraction and
$\epsilon_a$, for $\epsilon_b > \epsilon_a$. Thus, in principle, there is no
limit to degree of anisotropy that may be attained via homogenization. In
practice, the degree of anisotropy would be limited by the available value of
$\epsilon_b$ (and/or $\epsilon_a$).

conceptual framework inside which the issue of time should be addressed and
solved. We argue that time is an abstract entity created by the human mind, not
an ingredient of physical reality as physics normally assumes. Physical reality
is a process of ceaseless becoming and vanishing; time is not a part of that
process. Time does not flow: time is the artificial bank in relation to which
we measure the intensity and amount of the flow (change) of physical reality.
It is necessary to differentiate physical reality and abstract entities by

formulas from their interpretations: a correct formula can be interpreted in a

abundances of the most important metals in the atmosphere of Feige 48. The mean
atmospheric parameters we obtained from our four spectra of Feige 48 are :
Teff= 29,850 $\pm$ 60 K, log $g$ = 5.46 $\pm$ 0.01, and log N(He)/N(H) =
$-$2.88 $\pm$ 0.02. We also modeled for the first time the He II line at 1640

effective temperature and a surface gravity that match well the values obtained
with the optical data. With some fine tuning of the abundances of the metals
visible in the optical domain we were able to achieve a very good agreement
between our best available spectrum and our best-fitting synthetic one. Our
derived atmospheric parameters for Feige 48 are in rather good agreement with
previous estimates based on less sophisticated models. This underlines the
relatively small effects of the NLTE approach combined with line blanketing in

vorticity. Also, in the limit $\lambda_y\gg H$ the optimal growth $G\propto
(\Omega/\kappa)^4$, where $\Omega$ and $\kappa$ stand for local rotational and
epicyclic frequencies, respectively, what suggests that transient growth of
large scale vortices can be much stronger in areas with non-Keplerian rotation,
e.g. in the inner parts of relativistic discs around the black holes. We
estimate that if disc is already in a turbulent state with effective viscosity
given by the Shakura parameter $\alpha<1$, the considered large scale vortices
with wavelengths $H/\alpha>\lambda_y>H$ have the most favourable conditions to
be transiently amplified before they are damped. At the same time, turbulence
is a natural source of the potential vorticity for this transient activity. We
extend our study to a global spatial scale showing that global perturbations

in cell differentiation in a number of cell systems. The two genes express
transcription factors which repress each other's expression and autoactivate
their own production. A number of theoretical models have recently been
proposed based on the two-gene motif to provide a physical understanding of how
cell differentiation occurs. In this paper, we study a simple model of cell
differentiation which assumes no cooperativity in the regulation of gene
expression by the transcription factors. The latter repress each other's
activity directly through DNA binding and indirectly through the formation of
heterodimers. We specifically investigate how deterministic processes combined
with stochasticity contribute in bringing about cell differentiation. The
deterministic dynamics of our model give rise to a supercritical pitchfork
bifurcation from an undifferentiated stable steady state to two differentiated
stable steady states. The stochastic dynamics of our model are studied using
the approaches based on the Langevin equations and the linear noise
approximation. The simulation results provide a new physical understanding of
recent experimental observations. We further propose experimental measurements
of quantities like the variance and the lag-1 autocorrelation function in
protein fluctuations as the early signatures of an approaching bifurcation

existing regression methods all use the one-dimensional pixel-based error
model, which characterizes the representation error pixel by pixel individually
and thus neglects the whole structure of the error image. We observe that
occlusion and illumination changes generally lead to a low-rank error image. To
make use of this low-rank structural information, this paper presents a
two-dimensional image matrix based error model, i.e. matrix regression, for
face representation and classification. Our model uses the minimal nuclear norm
of representation error image as a criterion, and the alternating direction
method of multipliers method to calculate the regression coefficients. Compared
with the current regression methods, the proposed Nuclear Norm based Matrix
Regression (NMR) model is more robust for alleviating the effect of
illumination, and more intuitive and powerful for removing the structural noise
caused by occlusion. We experiment using four popular face image databases, the
Extended Yale B database, the AR database, the Multi-PIE and the FRGC database.
Experimental results demonstrate the performance advantage of NMR over the

of dust produced by supernovae are not well quantified. In this review, we

supernovae, present the various theoretical models on dust synthesis and their

  9789461971944",,,,"cond-mat.str-el physics.chem-ph physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During the past 15 years, the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) has
become increasingly important for ab initio quantum chemistry. The underlying
matrix product state (MPS) ansatz is a low-rank decomposition of the full
configuration interaction tensor. The virtual dimension of the MPS controls the
size of the corner of the many-body Hilbert space that can be reached.
  Whereas the MPS ansatz will only yield an efficient description for
noncritical one-dimensional systems, it can still be used as a variational
ansatz for other finite-size systems. Rather large virtual dimensions are then
required. The two most important aspects to reduce the corresponding
computational cost are a proper choice and ordering of the active space
orbitals, and the exploitation of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian. By
taking care of both aspects, DMRG becomes an efficient replacement for exact
diagonalization in quantum chemistry.
  DMRG and Hartree-Fock theory have an analogous structure. The former can be
interpreted as a self-consistent mean-field theory in the DMRG lattice sites,
and the latter in the particles. It is possible to build upon this analogy to
introduce post-DMRG methods. Based on an approximate MPS, these methods provide
improved ans\""atze for the ground state, as well as for excitations.
Exponentiation of the single-particle (single-site) excitations for a Slater
determinant (an MPS with open boundary conditions) leads to the Thouless
theorem for Hartree-Fock theory (DMRG), an explicit nonredundant
parameterization of the entire manifold of Slater determinants (MPS
wavefunctions). This gives rise to the configuration interaction expansion for
DMRG. The Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation lies at the basis of auxiliary
field quantum Monte Carlo for Slater determinants. An analogous transformation
for spin-lattice Hamiltonians allows to formulate a promising variant for MPSs.

field ($\Gamma$) on the antiferromagnetic $J_1-J_2$ Ising model on the
checkerboard lattice, the two dimensional version of the pyrochlore lattice.
The zero-temperature phase diagram of the model has been obtained by employing
a plaquette operator approach (POA). The plaquette operator formalism bosonizes
the model, in which a single boson is associated to each eigenstate of a
plaquette and the inter-plaquette interactions define an effective Hamiltonian.
The excitations of a plaquette would represent an-harmonic fluctuations of the
model, which lead not only to lower the excitation energy compared with a
single-spin flip but also to lift the extensive degeneracy in favor of a
plaquette ordered solid (RPS) state, which breaks lattice translational
symmetry, in addition to a unique collinear phase for $J_2>J_1$. The bosonic
excitation gap vanishes at the critical points to the N\'{e}el ($J_2 < J_1$)
and collinear ($J_2 > J_1$) ordered phases, which defines the critical phase
boundaries. At the homogeneous coupling ($J_2=J_1$) and its close neighborhood,
the (canted) RPS state, established from an-harmonic fluctuations, lasts for
low fields, $\Gamma/J_1\lesssim 0.3$, which is followed by a transition to the
quantum paramagnet (polarized) phase at high fields. The transition from RPS
state to the N\'{e}el phase is either a deconfined quantum phase transition or
a first order one, however a continuous transition occurs between RPS and
collinear phases.

decay from the hot and dense background are estimated in terms of the

re-examine the hot and dense background contributions to the electron mass and
compute its effect to the beta decay rate, helium yield, energy density of the
universe as well as the change in neutrino temperature from the first order
contribution to the self-mass of electrons during these processes. We
explicitly show that the thermal contribution to the helium abundance at T = m
of a cooling universe 0.045 % is higher than the corresponding contribution to
helium abundance of a heating universe 0.031% due to the existence of hot
fermions before the beginning of nucleosynthesis and their absence after the
nucleosynthesis, in the early universe. Thermal contribution to helium
abundance was a simple quadratic function of temperature, before and after the
nucleosynthesis. However, this quadratic behavior was not the same before the
decoupling temperature due to weak interactions; so the nucleosynthesis did not
even start before the universe had cooled down to the neutrino decoupling
temperatures and QED became a dominant theory. It is also explicitly shown that
the chemical potential in the core of supermassive and superdense stars affect
beta decay and their helium abundance but the background contributions depend
on the ratio between temperature and chemical potential and not the chemical
potential or temperature only. It has been noticed that temperature plays a
role of regulating parameter in an extremely dense systems.

numerical techniques, under the assumption that the electrons on localized
orbitals may be treated as classical continuum spins, we compute various
charge, spin and transport properties on square clusters at zero temperature.
We find that the main effect of the RSOC is the destruction of the
ferromagnetic state present in the FKLM at low electron fillings, with the
consequent suppression of conductivity. In addition, near half-filling the RSOC
leads to a departure of the antiferromagnetic state of the FKLM with a
consequent reduction to the intrinsic tendency to electronic phase separation.
The interplay between phase separation on one side, and magnetic and transport
properties on the other, is carefully analyzed as a function of the
RSOC/hopping ratio.

many log canonical counterexamples in each dimension, and all of these are

Applying modern statistical methods, we confirm that the gap time series are
long-range correlated and possess multifractal nature. These three features
vary from stock to stock and are not universal. Furthermore, we also unveil
buy-sell asymmetry phenomena in the properties of price gaps on the buy and
sell sides of the LOBs for individual stocks. These findings deepen our
understanding of the dynamics of liquidity of common stocks and can be used to

Standard Model that can account for neutrino masses and dark matter at the TeV
scale. It contains another scalar doublet and three additional singlet fermions
(N_i), all odd under a Z_2 symmetry. In this paper, we examine the possibility
that the dark matter candidate, N_1, does not reach thermal equilibrium in the
early Universe so that it behaves as a Feebly Interacting Massive Particle
(FIMP). In that case, it is found that the freeze-in production of dark matter
is entirely dominated by the decays of the odd scalars. We compute the
resulting dark matter abundance and study its dependence with the parameters of
the model. The freeze-in mechanism is shown to be able to account for the
observed relic density over a wide range of dark matter masses, from the keV to
the TeV scale. In addition to freeze-in, the N_1 relic density receives a
further contribution from the late decay of the next-to-lightest odd particle,
which we also analyze. Finally, we consider the possibility that the dark
matter particle is a WIMP but receives an extra contribution to its relic

structural defects in wurtzite semiconductors. The local deviation from the 2H
stacking of the wurtzite matrix to a 3C zinc-blende stacking induces a bound
state in the gap of the host crystal, resulting in the localization of
excitons. Due to the two-dimensional nature of these planar defects, stacking
faults act as quantum wells, giving rise to radiative transitions of excitons
with characteristic energies. Luminescence spectroscopy is thus capable of
detecting even a single stacking fault in an otherwise perfect wurtzite
crystal. This review draws a comprehensive picture of the luminescence
properties related to stacking faults in GaN. The emission energies associated
with different types of stacking faults as well as factors that can shift these
energies are discussed. In this context, the importance of the quantum-confined
Stark effect in these zinc-blende/wurtzite heterostructures, which results from
the spontaneous polarization of wurtzite GaN, is underlined. This discussion is
extended to zinc-blende segments in a wurtzite matrix. Furthermore, other
factors affecting the emission energy and linewidth of stacking fault-related
peaks as well as results obtained at room temperature are addressed. The
considerations presented in this article should be transferable also to other
wurtzite semiconductors.

Charged-lepton angular distributions in the decay are insensitive to anomalous

polarisation. However, these are difficult to measure in the case of highly

are then sensitive, in general, to both top polarisation and top anomalous

mechanics (QM) to cognitive psychology, decision making, and psychophysics
attracted a lot of interest. In particular, in \cite{DKBB} the possibility to
use of the projection postulate and representation of ""mental observables"" by
Hermitian operators was discussed in very detail. The main conclusion of the
recent discussions on the foundations of ""quantum(-like) cognitive psychology""
is that one has to be careful in determination of conditions of applicability
of the projection postulate as a mathematical tool for description of
measurements of observables represented by Hermitian operators. To represent
some statistical experimental data (both physical and mental) in the
quantum(-like) way, one has to use generalized quantum observables given by
positive operator-valued measures (POVMs). This paper contains a brief review
on POVMs which can be useful for newcomers to the field of quantum(-like)
studies. Especially interesting for cognitive psychology is a variant of the
formula of total probability (FTP) with the interference term derived for
incompatible observables given by POVMs. We present an interpretation of the
interference term from the psychological viewpoint. As was shown before, the
appearance of such a term (perturbing classical FTP) plays the important role
in cognitive psychology, e.g., recognition of ambiguous figures and the
disjunction effect. The interference term for observables given by POVMs has
much more complicated structure than the corresponding term for observables
given by Hermitian operators. We elaborate cognitive interpretations of
different components of the POVMs-interference term and apply our analysis to a
quantum(-like) model of decision making.

tolerated dose (MTD). Typically, the MTD is identified using a dose-escalation

subsequent subjects are treated at progressively higher dose levels until the
MTD is identified. The continual reassessment method (CRM) is a popular
model-based dose-escalation design, which utilizes a formal model for the
relationship between dose and toxicity to guide dose-finding. Recently, it was
shown that the CRM has a tendency to get ""stuck"" on a dose-level, with little
escalation or de-escalation in the late stages of the trial, due to the
long-memory property of the CRM. We propose the randomized CRM (rCRM), which

background (CMB) is expected to depend like TCMB~(1+z) on redshift z. Adiabatic
photon production (or destruction) or deviations from isotropy and homogeneity
could modify this scaling and several observational tests have been carried out
in response. Here, we explain why `adiabatic' conditions are extremely
difficult to establish in the redshift range targeted by these tests. Thus,
instead of leading to a simple rescaling of the CMB temperature, a spectral
distortion should be produced, which can be constrained using COBE/FIRAS. For
scenarios with late photon production, tests of the temperature-redshift
relation (TRR) should therefore be reinterpreted as weak spectral distortion
limits, directly probing the energy dependence of the photon production
process. For inhomogeneous cosmologies, an average y-type distortion is
produced, but this type of distortion can be created in several other ways.
Here, we briefly discuss possible effects that may help disentangling different
contributions to the distortion signal, finding this to be very challenging. We
furthermore argue that tests of the TRR, using the SZ effect have limited
applicability and that for non-gravitational changes to the TRR the CMB
anisotropy spectrum should exhibit an additional y-type dependence.

physiological constraints in the arterial network of mammals - i.e. hematocrit,
vessels diameters and arterial pressure drops - could have been selected by
evolution. We propose that the arterial network evolved while being constrained
by its function as an organ. To support this hypothesis, we focus our study on
one of the main function of blood network: oxygen supply to the organs. We
consider an idealized organ with a given oxygen need and we optimize blood
network geometry and hematocrit with the constraint that it must fulfill the
organ oxygen need. Our model accounts for the non-Newtonian behavior of blood,
its maintenance cost and F\aa hr\ae us effects (decrease in average
concentration of red blood cells as the vessel diameters decrease). We show
that the mean shear rates (relative velocities of fluid layers) in the tree
vessels follow a scaling law related to the multi-scale property of the tree
network, and we show that this scaling law drives the behavior of the optimal
hematocrit in the tree. We apply our scenario to physiological data and reach
results fully compatible with the physiology: we found an optimal hematocrit of
0.43 and an optimal ratio for diameter decrease of about 0.79. Moreover our
results show that pressure drops in the arterial network should be regulated in

after a precise determination of the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, severely
constrain such models. We make a thorough study of one such class of models
that may have interesting signatures at the upgraded LHC. In this class of
models, the relevant trilinear couplings are of the form $\lambda'_{i33}$, so
if the lighter stop squark $\tilde{t}_1$ is the lightest supersymmetric
particle (LSP), it will decay only through these couplings, giving rise to
events with isolated hard leptons and jets. Even when $\tilde{t}_1$ is the
next-to-LSP (NLSP), it can decay via the tiny $\lambda'$ couplings allowed by
the neutrino data, although it may face stiff competition from some R-parity
conserving decay modes. Using a simple Pythia based simulation, we find that in
both the cases the signal consisting of a pair of oppositely charged leptons
($ee$, $\mu \mu$ or $e \mu $) plus jets may be observable at the upgraded LHC

$\mathbb{R}\times S_2$ throat) by a mode sum approach, using a sharp energy
cut-off and the Abel-Plana formula; Lorentz invariance is then restored by use
of a Pauli-Villars regulator. The massless conformally-coupled case is found to
have a logarithmic divergence (which we renormalise) and a conformal anomaly,
the thermodynamic relevance of which is discussed. Provided the throat radius
is above some fixed length, the renormalised Casimir energy-density is seen to
be negative by all timelike observers, and almost all null rays; furthermore,
it has sufficient magnitude to stabilise a long-throated wormhole far larger
than the Planck scale, at least in principle. Unfortunately, the renormalised
Casimir energy-density is zero for null rays directed exactly parallel to the
throat, and this shortfall prevents us from stabilising the ultrastatic
spherically-symmetric wormhole considered here. Nonetheless, the negative
Casimir energy does allow the wormhole to collapse extremely slowly, its
lifetime growing without bound as the throat-length is increased. We find that
the throat closes slowly enough that its central region can be safely traversed

extensions by generalizing the notion of atom used in these programs. Among
these, there are aggregate atoms, HEX atoms, generalized quantifiers, and
abstract constraints. In this paper we refer to these constructs collectively
as generalized atoms. The idea common to all of these constructs is that their
satisfaction depends on the truth values of a set of (non-generalized) atoms,
rather than the truth value of a single (non-generalized) atom. Motivated by
several examples, we argue that for some of the more intricate generalized
atoms, the previously suggested semantics provide unintuitive results and
provide an alternative semantics, which we call supportedly stable or SFLP
answer sets. We show that it is equivalent to the major previously proposed
semantics for programs with convex generalized atoms, and that it in general
admits more intended models than other semantics in the presence of non-convex
generalized atoms. We show that the complexity of supportedly stable models is
on the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, similar to previous proposals
and to stable models of disjunctive logic programs. Given these complexity
results, we provide a compilation method that compactly transforms programs
with generalized atoms in disjunctive normal form to programs without
generalized atoms. Variants are given for the new supportedly stable and the
existing FLP semantics, for which a similar compilation technique has not been
known so far.

ability to weight the base clusterings without access to the original data and
can be affected significantly by the low-quality, or even ill clusterings.
Secondly, they generally focus on the instance level or cluster level in the

data clustering with a Gaussian copula mixture model, since copulas, and in
particular the Gaussian ones, are powerful tools for easily modelling the
distribution of multivariate variables. Indeed, considering a mixing of
continuous, integer and ordinal variables (thus all having a cumulative
distribution function), this copula mixture model defines intra-component
dependencies similar to a Gaussian mixture, so with classical correlation
meaning. Simultaneously, it preserves standard margins associated to
continuous, integer and ordered features, namely the Gaussian, the Poisson and
the ordered multinomial distributions. As an interesting by-product, the
proposed mixture model generalizes many well-known ones and also provides tools
of visualization based on the parameters. At a practical level, the Bayesian
inference is retained and it is achieved with a Metropolis-within-Gibbs

expected advantages of the proposed model for mixed data: flexible and

the perpendicular profile of the magnetic-field-aligned (parallel) plasma flow

by a gradient in either the ion-temperature profile or by shear in the parallel
flow has been discussed extensively in the literature. In this paper,
hydrodynamic plasma stability is investigated, real and imaginary frequency are
quantified over a range of the shear parameter, the normalized wavenumber, and
the ratio of density-gradient and ion-temperature-gradient scale lengths, and
the role of inverse Landau damping is illustrated for the case of combined
ion-temperature gradient and parallel-flow shear. We find that increasing the
ion-temperature gradient reduces the instability threshold for the hydrodynamic
parallel-flow shear instability, also known as the parallel Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability or the D'Angelo instability. We also find that a kinetic
instability arises from the coupled, reinforcing action of both free-energy
sources. For the case of comparable electron and ion temperature, we illustrate
analytically the transition of the D'Angelo instability to the kinetic
instability as the shear parameter, the normalized wavenumber, and the ratio of
density-gradient and ion-temperature-gradient scale lengths are varied and we
attribute the changes in stability to changes in the amount of inverse ion
Landau damping. We show that, near a normalized wavenumber $k_{\perp} \rho_{i}$
of order unity, the real and imaginary values of frequency become comparable

by progressive loss of movement, tremors, and speech slurring. PD is due to the
loss of dopamine-producing brain cells, and symptoms only worsen over time,
making early detection and diagnosis of the disease key to effective management
and treatment. There is currently no standardized method of diagnosis
available, and instead a combination of the medical history of a patient and
physician judgment is used. In this research, a novel method of accurately
diagnosing PD using an artificial neural network (ANN) and speech measurements
was developed. Using this technology, a patient need only speak into a computer
microphone. Speech data is then analyzed using Praat and inputted into the ANN
to obtain the diagnosis. The ANN, built using MATLAB and trained and tested
with actual patient data, was able to correctly classify 96.55% of test data. A
mathematical model of the GPe/STN neural cluster was then constructed to
account for Parkinsonian tremor. This was done using a two-cell model that
coupled a GPe neuron to a STN neuron and consisted of a system of twelve
ordinary differential equations. The model was structured to account for neuron
bursting behavior, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic connections between
neurons. After comparison to the biological behavior of the cluster and neuron
firing patterns in PD patients, the model was determined to be predictive of
known biological results. This work presents a significant step forward in PD
research and could be successfully implemented into clinical practice.

present-day MOC is sensitive to freshwater anomalies and may collapse to a
state with a strongly reduced northward heat transport. A future collapse of
the Atlantic MOC has been identified as one of the most dangerous tipping
points in the climate system. It is therefore crucial to develop early warning
indicators for such a potential collapse based on relatively short time series.
So far, attempts to use indicators based on critical slowdown have been
marginally successful. Based on complex climate network reconstruction, we here
present a promising new indicator for the MOC collapse that efficiently
monitors spatial changes in deep ocean circulation. Through our analysis of the
performance of this indicator we formulate optimal locations of measurement of
the MOC to provide early warning signals of a collapse. Our results imply that
an increase in spatial resolution of the Atlantic MOC observations (i.e., at
more sections) can improve early detection, because the spatial coherence in
the deep ocean arising near the transition is better captured.

super-luminous supernovae followed by the Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of
Transient Objects (PESSTO). Time series spectroscopy from a few days after
maximum light to 100 days later shows them to be fairly typical of this class,
with spectra dominated by Ca II, Mg II, Fe II and Si II, which evolve slowly
over most of the post-peak photospheric phase. We determine bolometric light
curves and apply simple fitting tools, based on the diffusion of energy input
by magnetar spin-down, 56Ni decay, and collision of the ejecta with an opaque
circumstellar shell. We investigate how the heterogeneous light curves of our
sample (combined with others from the literature) can help to constrain the
possible mechanisms behind these events. We have followed these events to
beyond 100-200 days after peak, to disentangle host galaxy light from fading
supernova flux and to differentiate between the models, which predict diverse
behaviour at this phase. Models powered by radioactivity require unrealistic
parameters to reproduce the observed light curves, as found by previous
studies. Both magnetar heating and circumstellar interaction still appear to be
viable candidates. A large diversity is emerging in observed tail-phase
luminosities, with magnetar models failing in some cases to predict the rapid
drop in flux. This would suggest either that magnetars are not responsible, or
that the X-ray flux from the magnetar wind is not fully trapped. The light
curve of one object shows a distinct re-brightening at around 100d after
maximum light. We argue that this could result either from multiple shells of
circumstellar material, or from a magnetar ionisation front breaking out of the
ejecta.

for measuring tail dependence in copulas may sometimes underestimate the extent
of extreme co-movements of dependent risks and, therefore, may not always
comply with the new paradigm of prudent risk management. This phenomenon holds
in the context of both symmetric and asymmetric copulas with and without
singularities. As a remedy, we introduce a notion of paths of maximal (tail)

The suggested new indices are conservative, conform with the basic concepts of
modern quantitative risk management, and are able to distinguish between
distinct risky positions in situations when the existing indices fail to do so.

an alternative approach where users only disclose an aggregate model -- the

extract an aggregate model of the underlying data. We evaluate our framework on

field on the spin of an electron confined to a quantum dot (QD). The
fluctuations arise from nuclear angular momentum being exchanged between
different nuclei via the nuclear magnetic dipole coupling. We focus on the role
of the nuclear electric quadrupole moments (QPMs), which generally cause a
reduction in internuclear spin transfer efficiency in the presence of electric
field gradients. The effects on the electron spin coherence time are studied by
modeling an electron spin echo experiment. We find that the QPMs cause an
increase in the electron spin coherence time and that an inhomogeneous
distribution of the quadrupolar shift, where different nuclei have different
shifts in energy, causes an even larger increase in the electron coherence time
than a homogeneous distribution. Furthermore, a partial polarization of the
nuclear spin ensemble amplifies the effect of the inhomogeneous quadrupolar
shifts, causing an additional increase in electron coherence time, and provides
an alternative to the experimentally challenging suggestion of full dynamic
nuclear spin polarization.

However, the functional form of the MDA relation does not follow from theory in
a straightforward manner; in general, empirical MDA relations are inserted ad
