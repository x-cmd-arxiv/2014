on a dense subalgebra, and then shown to be bounded using harmonic analysis. En

a concrete realization of the ""dual convolution"" for this group as a kind of
twisted, operator-valued convolution. We also give some partial results for
solvable groups which give further evidence to support the general conjecture.

along the AGB through the circumstellar 12CO/13CO ratio. This is the first time
a sample including a significant number of M- and S-type stars is analysed
together with a carbon-star sample of equal size, making it possible to
investigate trends among the different types and establish evolutionary
effects. The circumstellar 12CO/13CO abundance ratios are estimated through a
detailed radiative transfer analysis of single-dish radio line emission
observations. First, the 12CO radiative transfer is solved, assuming an
abundance (dependent on the chemical type of the star), to give the physical
parameters of the gas, i.e. mass-loss rate, gas expansion velocity, and gas
temperature distribution. Then, the 13CO radiative transfer is solved using the
results of the 12CO model giving the 13CO abundance. Finally, the 12CO/13CO
abundance ratio is calculated. The circumstellar 12CO/13CO abundance ratio
differs between the three spectral types. This is consistent with what is
expected from stellar evolutionary models assuming that the spectral types
constitute an evolutionary sequence; however, this is the first time this has
been shown observationally for a relatively large sample covering all three
spectral types. The median value of the 13CO abundance in the inner
circumstellar envelope is 1.6x10^-5, 2.3x10^-5, and 3.0x10^-5 for the M-type,
S-type, and carbon stars of the sample, respectively, corresponding to
12CO/13CO abundance ratios of 13, 26, and 34, respectively. Interestingly, the
abundance ratio spread of the carbon stars is much larger than for the M- and
S-type stars, even when excluding J-type carbon stars, in line with what could
be expected from evolution on the AGB. We find no correlation between the
isotopologue ratio and the mass-loss rate, as would be expected if both
increase as the star evolves.

develop a numerical blob method for the aggregation equation. This provides a
counterpoint to existing literature on particle methods. By regularizing the
velocity field with a mollifier or ""blob function"", the blob method has a
faster rate of convergence and allows a wider range of admissible kernels. In
fact, we prove arbitrarily high polynomial rates of convergence to classical
solutions, depending on the choice of mollifier. The blob method conserves mass
and the corresponding particle system is both energy decreasing for a
regularized free energy functional and preserves the Wasserstein gradient flow
structure. We consider numerical examples that validate our predicted rate of
convergence and illustrate qualitative properties of the method.

galaxies, there is an emerging view that outliers exist. Henize 2-10, NGC 4889,
and NGC1277 are examples of SMBHs at least an order of magnitude more massive
than their host galaxy suggests. The dynamical effects of such ultramassive
central black holes is unclear. Here, we perform direct N-body simulations of
mergers of galactic nuclei where one black hole is ultramassive to study the
evolution of the remnant and the black hole dynamics in this extreme regime. We
find that the merger remnant is axisymmetric near the center, while near the
large SMBH influence radius, the galaxy is triaxial. The SMBH separation
shrinks rapidly due to dynamical friction, and quickly forms a binary black
hole; if we scale our model to the most massive estimate for the NGC1277 black
hole, for example, the timescale for the SMBH separation to shrink from nearly
a kiloparsec to less than a parsec is roughly 10 Myr. By the time the SMBHs
form a hard binary, gravitational wave emission dominates, and the black holes
coalesce in a mere few Myr. Curiously, these extremely massive binaries appear
to nearly bypass the 3-body scattering evolutionary phase. Our study suggests
that in this extreme case, SMBH coalescence is governed by dynamical friction
followed nearly directly by gravitational wave emission, resulting in an rapid
and efficient SMBH coalescence timescale. We discuss the implications for
gravitational wave event rates and hypervelocity star production.

estimated by the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and can quantify the

estimated by the multi-type branching process via the Lagrange-Good inversion.
The proposed model is tested with data generated by the AC OPA cascading

offspring mean matrix indicate that the system is closer to criticality when
considering the interdependence of different types of outages. Compared with
empirically estimating the joint distribution of the total outages, good
estimate is obtained by using the multitype branching process with a much

that the multitype branching process can effectively predict the distribution

  If we call Berenstein and Kazhdan's realization of geometric crystals the

with highest weight, in the geometric crystal path model. This allows to prove
a geometric version of Littelmann's independence theorem. The geometric

label information, and then learns a classifier (a filter approach). Best
performance would be obtained by optimizing the classification error jointly
over DR mapping and classifier (a wrapper approach), but this is a difficult
nonconvex problem, particularly with nonlinear DR. Using the method of
auxiliary coordinates, we give a simple, efficient algorithm to train a
combination of nonlinear DR and a classifier, and apply it to a RBF mapping
with a linear SVM. This alternates steps where we train the RBF mapping and a
linear SVM as usual regression and classification, respectively, with a
closed-form step that coordinates both. The resulting nonlinear low-dimensional
classifier achieves classification errors competitive with the state-of-the-art
but is fast at training and testing, and allows the user to trade off runtime
for classification accuracy easily. We then study the role of nonlinear DR in
linear classification, and the interplay between the DR mapping, the number of
latent dimensions and the number of classes. When trained jointly, the DR
mapping takes an extreme role in eliminating variation: it tends to collapse
classes in latent space, erasing all manifold structure, and lay out class
centroids so they are linearly separable with maximum margin.

proportional fairness policy, where the fairness among users is in utility
percentage of the application running on the mobile station. Our objective is
to allocate the resources to the users optimally from multiple carriers. In
addition, every user subscribing for the mobile service is guaranteed to have a
minimum quality-of-service (QoS) with a priority criterion. Our rate allocation
algorithm selects the carrier or multiple carriers that provide the minimum
price for the needed resources. We prove that the novel resource allocation
optimization problem with joint carrier aggregation is convex and therefore the
optimal solution is tractable. We present a distributed algorithm to allocate
the resources optimally from multiple evolved NodeBs (eNodeB)s. Finally, we

is an important topic in various applications, such as petroleum engineering,
low Reynolds number suspension flows, dusty gas dynamics, and fluidized beds.
To simulate such flows, volume averaging spatial operators are considered to
incorporate pressure drag and skin friction experienced by a porous medium. In
this work, a streamline-based Lagrangian methodology is extended for an
efficient numerical approach to handle dispersion and diffusion of solvent
saturation during a miscible flow. Overall pressure drag on the diffusion and
dispersion of solvent saturation is investigated. Numerical results show
excellent agreement with the results obtained from asymptotic analysis. The
present numerical simulations indicate that the nonlinear effects due to skin
friction and pressure drag cannot be accurately captured by Darcy's method if
the contribution of the skin friction dominates over that of the pressure drag.
Moreover, mass conservation law is investigated, which is an important feature
for enhanced oil recovery, and the results help to guide a good agreement with
theory. This investigation examines how the flow regime may be optimized for
enhanced oil recovery methods.

stationary data sequence is considered over a strictly band-limited
frequency-selective channel. It is assumed that the transmitter employs linear
modulation and that the channel output is corrupted by additive proper-complex
cyclostationary noise. Under the average transmit power constraint, the problem
of minimizing the mean-squared error at the output of a widely linear receiver
is formulated in the time domain to find the optimal transmit and receive
waveforms. The optimization problem is converted into a frequency-domain
problem by using the vectorized Fourier transform technique and put into the
form of a double minimization. First, the widely linear receiver is optimized
that requires, unlike the linear receiver design with only one waveform, the
design of two receive waveforms. Then, the optimal transmit waveform for the
linear modulator is derived by introducing the notion of the impropriety
frequency function of a discrete-time random process and by performing a line
search combined with an iterative algorithm. The optimal solution shows that
both the periodic spectral correlation due to the cyclostationarity and the
symmetric spectral correlation about the origin due to the impropriety are well
exploited.

least to the second-order slow-roll parameters for single-field inflationary
models. The large value of $r$ and the Lyth bound indicate that it is
impossible to obtain the sub-Planckian excursion for the inflaton. However, we
derive an absolutely minimal bound $\Delta\phi/M_{\rm Pl}>\sqrt{r/2}$ on the
inflaton excursion for single-field inflationary models, which can be applied
to non-slow-roll inflationary models as well. This bound excludes the
possibility of the small-field inflation with $\Delta\phi<0.1 M_{\rm Pl}$ if
the BICEP2 result on $r$ stands and it opens the window of sub-Planckian
excursion with $\Delta\phi<M_{\rm Pl}$ even if $r$ is as large as $0.1$. To get
the sub-Planckian excursion with $\Delta\phi<0.1 M_{\rm Pl}$, our modified

Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) field red giant stars to date, involving 3037
objects spread across approximately 37.5 sq. deg., centred on this galaxy. We
find a median metallicity of [Fe/H]=-0.99+/-0.01, with clear evidence for an
abundance gradient of -0.075+/-0.011 dex / deg. over the inner 5 deg. We
interpret the abundance gradient to be the result of an increasing fraction of
young stars with decreasing galacto-centric radius, coupled with a uniform
global age-metallicity relation. We also demonstrate that the age-metallicity
relation for an intermediate age population located 10kpc in front of the NE of
the Cloud is indistinguishable from that of the main body of the galaxy,
supporting a prior conjecture that this is a stellar analogue of the Magellanic
Bridge. The metal poor and metal rich quartiles of our RGB star sample (with
complementary optical photometry from the Magellanic Clouds Photometric Survey)
are predominantly older and younger than approximately 6Gyr, respectively.
Consequently, we draw a link between a kinematical signature, tentatively
associated by us with a disk-like structure, and the upsurges in stellar
genesis imprinted on the star formation history of the central regions of the
SMC. We conclude that the increase in the star formation rate around 5-6Gyr ago
was most likely triggered by an interaction between the SMC and LMC.

in dependent and general case with the inclusion of CP-violation in the
coupling. Arguably the best process to study this coupling is the associa ted
production of Higgs boson along with a $t\bar t$ pair in a machine like the
International Linear Collider (ILC). While detailed analyses of the sensitivity
of the measurement assuming a Standard Model (SM) - like coupling are available
in the context of ILC, conclude that th e coupling could be pinned down at
about 10\% level with modest luminosity, our investigations show that the
scenario could be different in case of a more general coupling. The modified
Lorentz structure resulting in a changed functional dependence of the cross
section on the couplin g, along with the difference in the cross section itself
leads to considerable deviation in the sensitivity. Our studies with an ILC of
center of mass energies of 500 GeV, 800 GeV and 1000 GeV show that moderate
CP-mixing in the Higgs sector could change the sensitivity to about 20\ %,
while it could be worsened to 75\% in cases which could accommodate more
dramatic changes in the coupling. While detailed considerations of the decay
distributions point to a need for a relook at the analysis strategy followed
for the case of SM such as for a model independent analysis of the top quark
Yukawa coupling measurement. This study strongly suggests that, a joint
analysis of the CP properties and the Yukawa coupling measurement would be the
way forward at the ILC and that caution must be excercised in the measurem ent
of the Yukawa couplings and the conclusions drawn from it.

is of increasing interest in neuroimaging. Brain states departing from normal
waking consciousness are expected to be accompanied by alterations in the
aforementioned dynamics. In particular, the psychedelic experience produced by
psilocybin (a substance found in `magic mushrooms`) is characterized by
unconstrained cognition and profound alterations in the perception of time,
space and selfhood. Considering the spontaneous and subjective manifestation of
these effects, we hypothesize that neural correlates of the psychedelic
experience can be found in the dynamics and variability of spontaneous brain
activity fluctuations and connectivity, measurable with functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Fifteen healthy subjects were scanned before, during
and after intravenous infusion of psilocybin and an inert placebo. Blood-Oxygen
Level Dependent (BOLD) temporal variability was assessed computing the variance
and total spectral power, resulting in increased signal variability bilaterally
in the hippocampi and anterior cingulate cortex. Changes in BOLD signal
spectral behavior (including spectral scaling exponents) affected exclusively
higher brain systems such as the default mode, executive control and dorsal
attention networks. A novel framework enabled us to track different
connectivity states explored by the brain during rest. This approach revealed a
wider repertoire of connectivity states post-psilocybin than during control
conditions. Together, the present results provide a comprehensive account of
the effects of psilocybin on dynamical behaviour in the human brain at a
macroscopic level and may have implications for our understanding of the
unconstrained, hyper-associative quality of consciousness in the psychedelic
state.

solutions, which either estimate and compensate the frequency difference (skew)

possibly even backward jumps, our solution achieves synchronization without
these problems. We first analyze the convergence property of the algorithm and
provide explicit necessary and sufficient conditions on the parameters to
guarantee synchronization. We then study the effect of noisy measurements
(jitter) and frequency drift (wander) on the offsets and synchronization
frequency, and further optimize the parameter values to minimize their
variance. Our study reveals a few insights, for example, we show that our
algorithm can converge even in the presence of timing loops and noise, provided
that there is a well defined leader. This marks a clear contrast with current
standards such as NTP and PTP, where timing loops are specifically avoided.
Furthermore, timing loops can even be beneficial in our scheme as it is
demonstrated that highly connected subnetworks can collectively outperform
individual clients when the time source has large jitter. The results are
supported by experiments running on a cluster of IBM BladeCenter servers with
Linux.

implementation of long-distance quantum communication protocols using quantum
memories. Photon pairs with wavelengths 883 nm and 1338 nm are produced by
coherently pumping two periodically poled nonlinear waveguides embedded in the
arms of a polarization interferometer. Subsequent spectral filtering reduces
the bandwidth of the photons to 240 MHz. The bandwidth is well-matched to a
quantum memory based on an Nd:YSO crystal, to which, in addition, the center
frequency of the 883 nm photons is actively stabilized. A theoretical model
that includes the effect of the filtering is presented and accurately fits the
measured correlation functions of the generated photons. The model can also be
used as a way to properly assess the properties of the source. The quality of
the entanglement is revealed by a visibility of V = 96.1(9)% in a Bell-type
experiment and through the violation of a Bell inequality.

correct swimming direction during the various phases of the sexual reproduction
process. Whilst chemotaxis is assumed to dominate in the immediate vicinity of
the ovum, it is unclear which biochemical or physical cues guide spermatozoa on
their long journey towards the egg cell. Currently debated mechanisms range
from peristaltic pumping to temperature sensing (thermotaxis) and direct
response to fluid flow variations (rheotaxis), but little is known
quantitatively about their relative importance. Here, we report the first
quantitative experimental study of mammalian sperm rheotaxis. Using
microfluidic devices, we investigate systematically the swimming behavior of
human and bull sperm over the whole range of physiologically relevant shear
rates and viscosities. Our measurements show that the interplay of fluid shear,
steric surface-interactions and chirality of the flagellar beat leads to a
stable upstream spiraling motion of sperm cells, thus providing a generic and
robust rectification mechanism to support mammalian fertilisation. To
rationalise these findings, we identify a minimal mathematical model that is
capable of describing quantitatively the experimental observations. The
combined experimental and theoretical evidence supports the hypothesis that the
shape and beat patterns of mammalian sperm cells have evolved to optimally
exploit rheotaxis for long-distance navigation.

the Jupiter core is in the ""rigid liquid"" state and is highly conducting. We
finally analyse the evolution of iron conductivity in the core of smaller

supercritical core undergoes the transition to the rigid-liquid conducting

antiquarks from moving $Z(3)$ domain walls. CP violation here is spontaneous in
nature and arises from the nontrivial profile of the background gauge field

spontaneous CP violation on the baryon transport across the collapsing large
$Z(3)$ domain walls (which can arise in the context of certain low energy scale
inflationary models). Our results show that this CP violation can lead to large
concentrations of baryons and anti-baryons in the early universe. The quark and

dark matter candidate within standard model without violating any observational

sufficient and necessary conditions for satisfying collective rationality, we
study whether restricting the domain of argument-wise plurality voting to

laws. The key tool is a space-time splitting of adjoint error representations
for target functionals due to S\""uli and Hartmann. It provides an efficient
choice of timesteps for implicit computations of weakly instationary flows. The
timestep will be very large in regions of stationary flow, and become small
when a perturbation enters the flow field. Besides using adjoint techniques
which are already well-established, we also add a new ingredient which
simplifies the computation of the dual problem. Due to Galerkin orthogonality,
the dual solution {\phi} does not enter the error representation as such.
Instead, the relevant term is the difference of the dual solution and its
projection to the finite element space, {\phi}-{\phi}h . We can show that it is
therefore sufficient to compute the spatial gradient of the dual solution, $w =
{\nabla} {\phi}$. This gradient satisfies a conservation law instead of a
transport equation, and it can therefore be computed with the same algorithm as
the forward problem, and in the same finite element space. We demonstrate the
capabilities of the approach for a weakly instationary test problem for scalar
conservation laws.

tool of increasing importance in ecology, conservation monitoring and vocal
communication studies. To make classification useful in practice, it is crucial
to improve its accuracy while ensuring that it can run at big data scales. Many
approaches use acoustic measures based on spectrogram-type data, such as the
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features which represent a
manually-designed summary of spectral information. However, recent work in
machine learning has demonstrated that features learnt automatically from data
can often outperform manually-designed feature transforms. Feature learning can
be performed at large scale and ""unsupervised"", meaning it requires no manual
data labelling, yet it can improve performance on ""supervised"" tasks such as
classification. In this work we introduce a technique for feature learning from
large volumes of bird sound recordings, inspired by techniques that have proven
useful in other domains. We experimentally compare twelve different feature
representations derived from the Mel spectrum (of which six use this
technique), using four large and diverse databases of bird vocalisations, with
a random forest classifier. We demonstrate that MFCCs are of limited power in
this context, leading to worse performance than the raw Mel spectral data.
Conversely, we demonstrate that unsupervised feature learning provides a
substantial boost over MFCCs and Mel spectra without adding computational
complexity after the model has been trained. The boost is particularly notable
for single-label classification tasks at large scale. The spectro-temporal
activations learned through our procedure resemble spectro-temporal receptive
fields calculated from avian primary auditory forebrain.

R{\aa}dstr\""{o}m-type embedding theorem established in [50]: in this way we
reduce the norm-integral to that of a single-valued function taking values in
an $M$-space and we easily obtain new proofs for some decomposition results
recently stated in [33,36], based on the existence of integrable selections.
  Also the order-type integral has been studied: for the single-valued case
some basic results from [21] have been recalled, enlightning the differences
with the norm-type integral, specially in the case of $L$-space-valued
functions; as to multivalued mappings, a previous definition ([6]) is restated
in an equivalent way, some selection theorems are obtained, a comparison with
the Aumann integral is given, and decompositions of the previous type are
deduced also in this setting. Finally, some existence results are also
obtained, for functions defined in the real interval $[0,1]$.

  Time Spatial Time Series Data","A significantly rewritten version of the previous draft. The thorough
  discussion on identifiability issue of the GRFDSTM and the section on the
  application of GRFDSTM to moderate sized spatio-temporal data is added to the
  current version. The Article length is 50 pages excluding the reference.
  Total 43 figures",,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Discrete time spatial time series data arise routinely in meteorological and
environmental studies. Inference and prediction associated with them are mostly
carried out using any of the several variants of the linear state space model
that are collectively called linear dynamic spatio-temporal models (LDSTMs).
However, real world environmental processes are highly complex and are seldom
representable by models with such simple linear structure. Hence, nonlinear
dynamic spatio-temporal models (NLDSTMs) based on the idea of nonlinear
observational and evolutionary equation have been proposed as an alternative.
However, in that case, the caveat lies in selecting the specific form of
nonlinearity from a large class of potentially appropriate nonlinear functions.
Moreover, modeling by NLDSTMs requires precise knowledge about the dynamics
underlying the data. In this article, we address this problem by introducing
the Gaussian random functional dynamic spatio-temporal model (GRFDSTM). Unlike
the LDSTMs or NLDSTMs, in GRFDSTM both the functions governing the
observational and evolutionary equations are composed of Gaussian random
functions. We exhibit many interesting theoretical properties of the GRFDSTM
and demonstrate how model fitting and prediction can be carried out coherently
in a Bayesian framework. We also conduct an extensive simulation study and
apply our model to a real, SO2 pollution data over Europe. The results are
highly encouraging.

profile, content and network attributes. OSNs allow users to change their
online attributes with time, to reflect changes in their real-life. Temporal
changes in users' content and network attributes have been well studied in
literature, however little research has explored temporal changes in profile
attributes of online users. This work makes the first attempt to study changes
to a unique profile attribute of a user - username and on a popular OSN which
allows users to change usernames multiple times - Twitter. We collect, monitor
and analyze 8.7 million Twitter users at macroscopic level and 10,000 users at
microscopic level to understand username changing behavior. We find that around
10% of monitored Twitter users opt to change usernames for possible reasons
such as space gain, followers gain, and username promotion. Few users switch
back to any of their past usernames, however prefer recently dropped usernames
to switch back to. Users who change usernames are more active and popular than
users who don't. In-degree, activity and account creation year of users are
weakly correlated with their frequency of username change. We believe that past
usernames of a user and their associated benefits inferred from the past, can
help Twitter to suggest its users a set of suitable usernames to change to.
Past usernames may also help in other applications such as searching and
linking multiple OSN accounts of a user and correlating multiple Twitter
profiles to a single user.

resolve the gas and dust structure at (sub)mm wavelengths. The CO emission (at

on the dust evolution is investigated. The companion at 10 AU facilitates the
accumulation of mm-sized grains within a compact ring, ~ 20 - 30 AU, by ~ 10
Myr. The injection of a protoplanet at 1 Myr hastens the ring formation (~ 1.2
Myr) and also triggers the development of an outer ring (~ 100 - 200 AU). These
observations provide additional evidence for the presence of a close-in

stellar populations in NGC 6752 along the evolutionary sequence from the base
of the red giant branch down to the turnoff point. We find weak systematic
abundance trends with evolutionary phase for Ca, Ti, and Fe which are best
explained by stellar-structure models including atomic diffusion with efficient
additional mixing. We derive a new value for the initial lithium abundance of
NGC 6752 after correcting for the effect of atomic diffusion and additional
mixing which falls slightly below the predicted standard BBN value. We find
three stellar populations by combining photometric and spectroscopic data of
194 stars in the globular cluster NGC 6752. Abundance trends for groups of
elements, differently affected by atomic diffusion and additional mixing, are

that non-radiative processes do not play a major role for separations down to
$\sim 10 nm$. A polarized laser beam focused on one end of the plasmonic

create electron-hole pairs in the GaAs substrate during propagation. These free
carriers are subsequently captured by the quantum dots $\sim 25 nm$ below the

integrated quantum dot luminescence is used to image the propagating plasmon

observe different plasmonic modes at the remote waveguide end, enabling their
direct imaging in real space. This imaging technique is applied to a plasmonic
beamsplitter facilitating the determination of the splitting ratio between the
two beamsplitter output ports as the interaction length $L_i$ is varied. A

suitable model or structure to the temporal series of observed data, in order
to describe motion patterns in a compact way, and to discriminate between them.
In an unsupervised context, i.e., no prior model of the moving object(s) is
available, such a structure has to be learned from the data in a bottom-up
fashion. In recent times, volumetric approaches in which the motion is captured
from a number of cameras and a voxel-set representation of the body is built
from the camera views, have gained ground due to attractive features such as
inherent view-invariance and robustness to occlusions. Automatic, unsupervised
segmentation of moving bodies along entire sequences, in a temporally-coherent
and robust way, has the potential to provide a means of constructing a
bottom-up model of the moving body, and track motion cues that may be later
exploited for motion classification. Spectral methods such as locally linear
embedding (LLE) can be useful in this context, as they preserve ""protrusions"",
i.e., high-curvature regions of the 3D volume, of articulated shapes, while
improving their separation in a lower dimensional space, making them in this
way easier to cluster. In this paper we therefore propose a spectral approach
to unsupervised and temporally-coherent body-protrusion segmentation along time
sequences. Volumetric shapes are clustered in an embedding space, clusters are
propagated in time to ensure coherence, and merged or split to accommodate
changes in the body's topology. Experiments on both synthetic and real
sequences of dense voxel-set data are shown. This supports the ability of the
proposed method to cluster body-parts consistently over time in a totally
unsupervised fashion, its robustness to sampling density and shape quality, and
its potential for bottom-up model construction

insight into the processes responsible for generating biological diversity, and
genomic datasets are now permitting the estimation of histories and demographic
parameters with unprecedented accuracy. We used a genomic single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) dataset generated using a RAD-Seq method to investigate the
historical demography and phylogeography of a widespread lowland Neotropical
bird (Xenops minutus). As expected, we found that prominent landscape features
that act as dispersal barriers, such as Amazonian rivers and the Andes
Mountains, are associated with the deepest phylogeographic breaks, and also
that isolation by distance is limited in areas between these barriers. In
addition, we inferred positive population growth for most populations and
detected evidence of historical gene flow between populations that are now
physically isolated. Even with genomic estimates of historical demographic
parameters, we found the prominent diversification hypotheses to be untestable.
We conclude that investigations into the multifarious processes shaping species
histories, aided by genomic datasets, will provide greater resolution of
diversification in the Neotropics, but that future efforts should focus on
understanding the processes shaping the histories of lineages rather than
trying to reconcile these histories with landscape and climatic events in Earth
history.

sinusoidal signals is a classic yet important problem in statistical signal
processing. Its research has recently been advanced by atomic norm techniques
which exploit signal sparsity, work directly on continuous frequencies, and
completely resolve the grid mismatch problem of previous compressed sensing
methods. In this work we investigate the frequency recovery problem in the
presence of multiple measurement vectors (MMVs) which share the same frequency
components, termed as joint sparse frequency recovery and arising naturally
from array processing applications. To study the advantage of MMVs, we first
propose an $\ell_{2,0}$ norm like approach by exploiting joint sparsity and
show that the number of recoverable frequencies can be increased except in a
trivial case. While the resulting optimization problem is shown to be rank
minimization that cannot be practically solved, we then propose an MMV atomic
norm approach that is a convex relaxation and can be viewed as a continuous
counterpart of the $\ell_{2,1}$ norm method. We show that this MMV atomic norm
approach can be solved by semidefinite programming. We also provide theoretical
results showing that the frequencies can be exactly recovered under appropriate
conditions. The above results either extend the MMV compressed sensing results
from the discrete to the continuous setting or extend the recent
super-resolution and continuous compressed sensing framework from the single to
the multiple measurement vectors case. Extensive simulation results are
provided to validate our theoretical findings and they also imply that the
proposed MMV atomic norm approach can improve the performance in terms of
reduced number of required measurements and/or relaxed frequency separation
condition.

formation and chemical enrichment by nearby supernova explosions to the ability
to form planetary systems.In spite of this, detailed abundance studies are
currently available for relatively few regions. In this context, we present the
analysis of the metallicity of the Gamma Velorum cluster, based on the products
distributed in the first internal release of the Gaia-ESO Survey. The Gamma
Velorum candidate members have been observed with FLAMES, using both UVES and
Giraffe, depending on the target brightness and spectral type. In order to
derive a solid metallicity determination for the cluster, membership of the
observed stars must be first assessed. To this aim, we use several membership
criteria including radial velocities, surface gravity estimates, and the
detection of the photospheric lithium line. Out of the 80 targets observed with
UVES, we identify 14 high-probability members. We find that the metallicity of
the cluster is slightly subsolar, with a mean [Fe/H]=-0.057+/-0.018 dex.
Although J08095427-4721419 is one of the high-probability members, its
metallicity is significantly larger than the cluster average. We speculate
about its origin as the result of recent accretion episodes of rocky bodies of
~60 M_Sun hydrogen-depleted material from the circumstellar disk.

the Cassini spacecraft to cover the polar regions of Titan. A significant
fraction of these lakes or seas could possibly be interconnected with
subsurface liquid reservoirs of alkanes. In this paper, we investigate the
interplay that would happen between a reservoir of liquid hydrocarbons located
in Titan's subsurface and a hypothetical clathrate reservoir that progressively
forms if the liquid mixture diffuses throughout a preexisting porous icy layer.
To do so, we use a statistical-thermodynamic model in order to compute the
composition of the clathrate reservoir that forms as a result of the
progressive entrapping of the liquid mixture. This study shows that clathrate
formation strongly fractionates the molecules between the liquid and the solid
phases. Depending on whether the structure I or structure II clathrate forms,
the present model predicts that the liquid reservoirs would be mainly composed
of either propane or ethane, respectively. The other molecules present in the
liquid are trapped in clathrates. Any river or lake emanating from subsurface
liquid reservoirs that significantly interacted with clathrate reservoirs
should present such composition. On the other hand, lakes and rivers sourced by
precipitation should contain higher fractions of methane and nitrogen, as well
as minor traces of argon and carbon monoxide.

SINS/zC-SINF and KMOS3D surveys. This sample provides a unique analysis of the
mass-metallicity relation (MZR) over an extended redshift range using
consistent data analysis techniques and strong-line metallicity indicator. We
find a constant slope at the low-mass end of the relation and can fully
describe its redshift evolution through the evolution of the characteristic
turnover mass where the relation begins to flatten at the asymptotic
metallicity. At fixed mass and redshift, our data do not show a correlation
between the [NII]/Ha ratio and SFR, which disagrees with the 0.2-0.3dex offset
in [NII]/Ha predicted by the ""fundamental relation"" between stellar mass, SFR
and metallicity discussed in recent literature. However, the overall evolution
towards lower [NII]/Ha at earlier times does broadly agree with these
predictions.

coherent-state protocols, and measure the correlations necessary for 1sDI key
distribution up to an applied loss equivalent to 7.5 km and 3.5 km of optical

of computation noise, e.g. due to faulty logic in the processing units, which
represents a new source of errors that may occur during the decoding process.
To this end, we first introduce probabilistic models for the arithmetic and
logic units of the the finite-precision Min-Sum decoder, and then carry out the
density evolution analysis of the noisy Min-Sum decoder. We show that in some
particular cases, the noise introduced by the device can help the Min-Sum
decoder to escape from fixed points attractors, and may actually result in an
increased correction capacity with respect to the noiseless decoder. We also
reveal the existence of a specific threshold phenomenon, referred to as
functional threshold. The behavior of the noisy decoder is demonstrated in the
asymptotic limit of the code-length -- by using ""noisy"" density evolution
equations -- and it is also verified in the finite-length case by Monte-Carlo

continuous mass spectrum from a many-body perspective, which shows massive
conformal particles as compounds of two correlated massless particles. The
statistics of the compound (boson/fermion) depends on the helicity $h$ of the
massless components (integer/half-integer). Coherent states (CS) of
particle-hole pairs (""excitons"") are also explicitly constructed as the
exponential action of exciton (non-canonical) creation operators on the ground
state of unpaired particles. These CS are labeled by points $Z$ ($2\times 2$
complex matrices) on the Cartan-Bergman domain $\mathbb D_4=U(2,2)/U(2)^2$, and
constitute a generalized (matrix) version of Perelomov $U(1,1)$ coherent states
labeled by points $z$ on the unit disk $\mathbb D_1=U(1,1)/U(1)^2$. Firstly we
follow a geometric approach to the construction of CS, orthonormal basis,
$U(2,2)$ generators and their matrix elements and symbols in the reproducing
kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal H_\lambda(\mathbb D_4)$ of analytic
square-integrable holomorphic functions on $\mathbb D_4$, which carries a
unitary irreducible representation of $U(2,2)$ with index $\lambda\in\mathbb N$
(the conformal or scale dimension). Then we introduce a many-body
representation of the previous construction through an oscillator realization
of the $U(2,2)$ Lie algebra generators in terms of eight boson operators with
constraints. This particle picture allows us for a physical interpretation of
our abstract mathematical construction in the many-body jargon. In particular,
the index $\lambda$ is related to the number $2(\lambda-2)$ of unpaired quanta
and to the helicity $h=(\lambda-2)/2$ of each massless particle forming the
massive compound.

state shares several common features with amorphous ferromagnetic alloys. This

$\mu^{+}$SR detects a significant static magnetic disorder at the microscopic
scale. At the same time, the critical divergence of the third-harmonic
component of the ac magnetic susceptibility around $\sim 78$ K leads to
additional evidence towards the glassy nature of this magnetic phase. Finally,

and short-lived intermediates. Any study of such processes requires the
discovery and accurate modeling of their underlying reaction network. However,
this task is challenging due to the complexity in exploring all the possible
pathways and the high computational cost in accurately modeling a large number
of reactions. Fortunately, very often these processes are dominated by only a
limited subset of the network's reaction pathways. In this work we propose a
novel computationally inexpensive method to identify and select the key
pathways of complex reaction networks, so that high-level ab-initio
calculations can be more efficiently targeted at these critical reactions. The
method estimates the relative importance of the reaction pathways for given
reactants by analyzing the accelerated evolution of hundreds of replicas of the
system and detecting products formation. This acceleration-detection method is
able to tremendously speed up the reactivity of uni- and bimolecular reactions,
without requiring any previous knowledge of products or transition states.
Importantly, the method is efficiently iterative, as it can be
straightforwardly applied for the most frequently observed products, therefore
providing an efficient algorithm to identify the key reactions of extended
chemical networks. We verified the validity of our approach on three different
systems, including the reactivity of t-decalin with a methyl radical, and in
all cases the expected behavior was recovered within statistical error.

the present paper is to develop a novel methodology that extends a
well-established marginal procedure designed for hazard mixture models, in
order to draw approximate inference on survival functions that is not limited
to the posterior mean but includes, as remarkable examples, credible intervals
and median survival time. Our approach relies on a characterization of the
posterior moments that, in turn, is used to approximate the posterior
distribution by means of a technique based on Jacobi polynomials. The
inferential performance of our methodology is analyzed by means of an extensive
study of simulated data and real data consisting of leukemia remission times.
Although tailored to the survival analysis context, the procedure we introduce
can be adapted to a range of other models for which moments of the posterior

pipelines in the presence of excessive loading and corrosion effects to ensure
a leak-free transport of hazardous materials. The main idea behind this
reliability analysis is to model the given pipeline system as a Reliability
Block Diagram (RBD) of segments such that the reliability of an individual
pipeline segment can be represented by a random variable. Traditionally,
computer simulation is used to perform this reliability analysis but it
provides approximate results and requires an enormous amount of CPU time for
attaining reasonable estimates. Due to its approximate nature, simulation is
not very suitable for analyzing safety-critical systems like oil and gas
pipelines, where even minor analysis flaws may result in catastrophic
consequences. As an accurate alternative, we propose to use a
higher-order-logic theorem prover (HOL) for the reliability analysis of
pipelines. As a first step towards this idea, this paper provides a
higher-order-logic formalization of reliability and the series RBD using the
HOL theorem prover. For illustration, we present the formal analysis of a
simple pipeline that can be modeled as a series RBD of segments with
exponentially distributed failure times.
