exoplanets are being detected. Characterising their atmospheres using transit
observations will become a key datum in the quest for detecting an Earth-like
exoplanet. The atmospheric transmission spectrum of our Earth will be an ideal
template for comparison with future exo-Earth candidates. By observing a lunar
eclipse, which offers a similar configuration to that of an exoplanet transit,
we have obtained a high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio transmission
spectrum of the Earth's atmosphere. This observation was performed with the
High Resolution Spectrograph at Xinglong Station, China during the total lunar
eclipse in December 2011. We compare the observed transmission spectrum with
our atmospheric model, and determine the characteristics of the various
atmospheric species in detail. In the transmission spectrum, O2, O3, O2-O2, NO2
and H2O are detected, and their column densities are measured and compared with
the satellites data. The visible Chappuis band of ozone produces the most
prominent absorption feature, which suggests that ozone is a promising molecule
for the future exo-Earth characterization. The individual O2 lines are resolved
and O2 isotopes are clearly detected. Our new observations do not confirm the
absorption features of Ca II or Na I which have been reported in previous lunar
eclipse observations. However, features in these and some other strong
Fraunhofer line positions do occur in the observed spectrum. We propose that
these are due to a Raman-scattered component in the forward-scattered sunlight
appearing in the lunar umbral spectrum. Water vapour absorption is found to be
rather weak in our spectrum because the atmosphere we probed is relatively dry,
which prompts us to discuss the detectability of water vapour in Earth-like
exoplanet atmospheres.

both the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and the Fermi liquid. Similar to the
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, no finite-momentum quasiparticles are supported by
the quasi-Fermi liquid; on the other hand, its fermion occupation number
demonstrates finite discontinuity at the Fermi energy, which is a hallmark
feature of the Fermi liquid. Possible realization of the quasi-Fermi liquid

universe should find the redshift distribution to be isotropic. However, a
peculiar motion of the observer would introduce a dipole anisotropy in the
observed redshift distribution. Conversely, a dipole anisotropy in observed
redshift distribution could be exploited to infer our peculiar motion, or
rather of our solar system. We determine here our peculiar velocity by studying
the dipole anisotropy in the redshift distribution of a large sample of
quasars. The magnitude of the peculiar velocity thus determined turns out to be
$2350\pm280$ km s$^{-1}$, not only much larger than 370 km s$^{-1}$ determined
from the dipole anisotropy in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR),
but also nearly in an opposite direction. Such large values for peculiar
velocity have been found in a couple of radio surveys too, but with a direction
along the CMBR dipole. Large genuine differences in the inferred motion,
whether in magnitude or direction, are rather disconcerting since a solar
peculiar velocity should not depend upon the method of its determination. Such
discordant dipoles imply perhaps an anisotropic universe, violating the
cosmological principle, a cornerstone of the modern cosmology.

fundamental task spanning a wide spectrum of real-world applications, which is
known to be NP-hard for general graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel
semidefinite relaxation formulation (referred to as SDR) to estimate the MAP
assignment. Algorithmically, we develop an accelerated variant of the
alternating direction method of multipliers (referred to as SDPAD-LR) that can
effectively exploit the special structure of the new relaxation. Encouragingly,
the proposed procedure allows solving SDR for large-scale problems, e.g.,
problems on a grid graph comprising hundreds of thousands of variables with
multiple states per node. Compared with prior SDP solvers, SDPAD-LR is capable
of attaining comparable accuracy while exhibiting remarkably improved
scalability, in contrast to the commonly held belief that semidefinite
relaxation can only been applied on small-scale MRF problems. We have evaluated
the performance of SDR on various benchmark datasets including OPENGM2 and PIC
in terms of both the quality of the solutions and computation time.
Experimental results demonstrate that for a broad class of problems, SDPAD-LR
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in producing better MAP assignment in
an efficient manner.

compact object in a very short orbital period of 4.8h. The only confirmed
microquasar with high energy gamma-ray emission, Cyg X-3 provides a unique
opportunity to study the relationship between the accretion power and the power
in high energy emission. Because of a compact orbit and a slow Wolf-Rayet wind,
the flow structure around the compact object is thought to be strongly affected
by the orbital motion, details of which can be obtained only by numerical
simulations. In this paper, we report on the results from 3D hydrodynamic
simulations of the wind accretion in Cyg X-3. For simplicity we adopt an
anti-gravity-like force that emulates the radiative acceleration consistent
with the beta-velocity wind. Due to the rapid orbital motion, the flow around
the compact object has large density gradients. As a result, the accretion rate
onto the compact object is significantly lower than that of the
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton rate. We also calculate the model X-ray light curve.
Although it roughly agrees with the observed light curve, more detailed
modeling is needed for detailed comparison.

optimally (so that the total cost of transportation is minimal) to the mass
distribution $\nu$ on $Y$. Then, roughly speaking, the Kantorovich duality
theorem asserts that there is a price $f(x)$ for a unit of mass sold (say by
the producer to the distributor) at $x$ and a price $g(y)$ for a unit of mass
sold (say by the distributor to the end consumer) at $y$ such that for any

$g(y)-f(x)=c(x,y)$ if indeed a nonzero mass was transported (via the optimal
transportation plan) from $x$ to $y$. We consider the following optimal pricing
problem: suppose that a new pricing policy is to be determined while keeping a
part of the optimal transportation plan fixed and, in addition, some prices at
the sources of this part are also kept fixed. From the producers' side, what
would then be the highest compatible pricing policy possible? From the
consumers' side, what would then be the lowest compatible pricing policy
possible? In the framework of $c$-convexity theory, we have recently introduced
and studied optimal $c$-convex $c$-antiderivatives and explicit constructions
of these optimizers were presented. In the present paper we employ optimal
$c$-convex $c$-antiderivatives and conclude that these are natural solutions to
the optimal pricing problems mentioned above. This type of problems drew
attention in the past and existence results were previously established in the

for general spaces $X,Y$ and real-valued, lower semicontinuous cost functions

be the smoking gun of not only the primordial tensor mode but also of the
primordial vector mode. If there exist nonzero vector-mode metric perturbations
in the early Universe, they are known to be supported by anisotropic stress
fluctuations of free-streaming particles such as neutrinos, and to create
characteristic signatures on both the CMB temperature, E-mode, and B-mode
polarization anisotropies. We place constraints on the properties of the
primordial vector mode characterized by the vector-to-scalar ratio $r_{v}$ and
the spectral index $n_{v}$ of the vector-shear power spectrum, from the {\it
Planck} and BICEP2 B-mode data. We find that, for scale-invariant initial
spectra, the $\Lambda$CDM model including the vector mode fits the data better
than the model including the tensor mode. The difference in $\chi^{2}$ between
the vector and tensor models is $\Delta\chi^{2} = 3.294$, because, on large
scales the vector mode generates smaller temperature fluctuations than the
tensor mode, which is preferred for the data. In contrast, the tensor mode can
fit the data set equally well if we allow a significantly blue-tilted spectrum.
We find that the best-fitting tensor mode has a large blue tilt and leads to an
indistinct reionization bump on larger angular scales. The slightly red-tilted
vector mode supported by the current data set can also create ${\cal
O}(10^{-22})$-Gauss magnetic fields at cosmological recombination. Our
constraints should motivate research that considers models of the early
Universe that involve the vector mode.

One notable exception is the small tidal arc 3.5 kpc south of the nucleus where
excess soft X-ray continuum emission and Si XIII 1.8 keV line emission are
detected, consistent with star formation and its associated alpha-element
enhancement, respectively. An X-ray shadow is also detected at the location of
the 15-kpc northern tidal tail. The hard X-ray continuum emission within 6 kpc
of the center is consistent with being due entirely to the bright central AGN.
The soft X-ray spectrum of the outer (>6 kpc) portion of the nebula is best
described as the sum of two thermal components with T~3 and ~8 million K and
spatially uniform super-solar alpha element abundances, relative to iron. This
result implies enhanced star formation activity over ~10^8 yrs accompanied with
redistribution of the metals on large scale. The low-temperature thermal
component is not present within 6 kpc of the nucleus, suggesting extra heating
in this region from the circumnuclear starburst, the central quasar, or the
wide-angle quasar-driven outflow identified from optical IFU spectroscopy on a
scale of >3 kpc. Significant azimuthal variations in the soft X-ray intensity
are detected in the inner region where the outflow is present. The soft X-ray
emission is weaker in the western quadrant, coincident with a deficit of Halpha

suggest that they contain constant density DM cores, while N-body simulations
instead predict a cuspy profile. We present a data set of high resolution
integral field spectroscopy on seven galaxies and measure the stellar and gas
kinematics simultaneously. Using Jeans modeling on our full sample, we examine
whether gas kinematics in general produce shallower density profiles than are
derived from the stars. Although 2/7 galaxies show some localized differences
in their rotation curves between the two tracers, estimates of the central
logarithmic slope of the DM density profile, gamma, are generally robust. The
mean and standard deviation of the logarithmic slope for the population are
gamma=0.67+/-0.10 when measured in the stars and gamma=0.58+/-0.24 when
measured in the gas. We also find that the halos are not under concentrated at
the radii of half their maximum velocities. Finally, we search for correlations
of the DM density profile with stellar velocity anisotropy and other baryonic
properties. Two popular mechanisms to explain cored DM halos are an exotic DM
component or feedback models that strongly couple the energy of supernovae into
repeatedly driving out gas and dynamically heating the DM halos. We investigate
correlations that may eventually be used to test models. We do not find a
secondary parameter that strongly correlates with the central DM density slope,
but we do find some weak correlations. Determining the importance of these
correlations will require further model developments and larger observational

the presence of multiple fluctuating components of the energy density. In the
presence of massive neutrinos we find a small but pronounced feature in the
halo bias near the neutrino free-streaming scale. The neutrino feature is a
small step with amplitude that increases with halo mass and neutrino mass
density. The scale-dependent halo bias lessens the suppression of the
small-scale halo power spectrum and should therefore weaken constraints on
neutrino mass from the galaxy auto-power spectrum and correlation function. On
the other hand, the feature in the bias is itself a novel signature of massive
neutrinos that can be studied independently.

galaxies around central galaxies at 0.2<z<1.2. Using statistical background
subtraction of contaminating sources we derive satellite stellar mass
distributions in four bins of central galaxy mass in three redshift ranges. Our
results show that the stellar mass function of satellite galaxies increases
with central galaxy mass, and that the distribution of satellite masses at
fixed central mass is at most weakly dependent on redshift. We conclude that
the average mass distribution of galaxies in groups is remarkably universal
even out to z=1.2 and that it can be uniquely characterized by the group
central galaxy mass. This further suggests that as central galaxies grow in
stellar mass, they do so in tandem with the mass growth of their satellites.
Finally, we classify all galaxies as either star forming or quiescent, and
derive the mass functions of each subpopulation separately. We find that the
mass distribution of both star forming and quiescent satellites show minimal
redshift dependence at fixed central mass. However, while the fraction of
quiescent satellite galaxies increases rapidly with increasing central galaxy
mass, that of star forming satellites decreases.

an important test of the masses of relic neutrino species. The dominant effect
of neutrino mass is to lower the typical amplitude of density perturbations
that eventually form halos, but for neutrino masses $> 0.4eV$ the threshold for
halo formation can be changed significantly as well. We study the spherical
collapse model for halo formation in cosmologies with neutrino masses in the
range $m_{\nu i} =0.05eV$- $1eV$ and find that halo formation is differently
sensitive to $\Omega_\nu$ and $m_\nu$. That is, different neutrino hierarchies
with common $\Omega_\nu$ are in principle distinguishable. The added
sensitivity to $m_{\nu}$ is small but potentially important for scenarios with
heavier sterile neutrinos. Massive neutrinos cause the evolution of density
perturbations to be scale-dependent at high redshift which complicates the
usual mapping between the collapse threshold and halo abundance. We propose one
way of handling this and compute the correction to the halo mass function
within this framework. For $\sum m_{\nu i} < 0.3eV$, our prescription for the
halo abundance is only $\sim< 15\%$ different than the standard calculation.
However for larger neutrino masses the differences approach $50-10\%$ which, if
verified by simulations, could alter neutrino mass constraints from cluster
abundance.

supernova feedback in ejecting gas from low-mass halos, and tracks the
resulting impact on the subsequent growth of more massive systems via halo
mergers and gas accretion. Our model shows that: (i) the smallest halos (halo

nuclear de-excitation of an excited element into the ground state in two viable
concrete reactions: the decay of the $0^+$ excited state of $^{16}$O populated
via a $(p,\alpha)$ reaction on fluorine and from radioactive $^{144}$Ce decay
where the scalar is produced in the de-excitation of $^{144}$Nd$^*$, which
occurs along the decay chain. Subsequent scattering on electrons,
$e(\phi,\gamma)e$, yields a mono-energetic signal that is observable in
neutrino detectors. We show that this proposed experimental set-up can cover
new territory for masses $250\, {\rm keV}\leq m_\phi \leq 2 m_e$ and couplings
to protons and electrons, $10^{-11} < g_e g_p < 10^{-7}$. This parameter space
is motivated by explanations of the ""proton charge radius puzzle"", thus this
strategy adds a viable new physics component to the neutrino and nuclear
astrophysics programs at underground facilities.

of the transition between radiatively efficient and inefficient accretion discs

by stacking two dimensional topological phases. The interesting aspect of such
a construction is that even though the topological building blocks in the low
dimension may be gapped, the higher dimensional semimetallic phase emerges as a
gapless critical point of a topological phase transition between two distinct
insulating phases. In this work, we extend this idea by constructing
three-dimensional topological semimetallic phases akin to Weyl systems by
stacking one-dimensional Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) lattice tight binding models
with non-trivial topology. The generalized AAH model is a family of one
dimensional tight binding models with cosine modulations in both hopping and
onsite energy terms. In this paper, we present a two-parameter generalization
of the AAH model that can access topological phases in three dimensions within
a unified framework. We show that the $\pi$-flux state of this two-parameter
AAH model manifests three dimensional topological semimetallic phases where the
topological features are embedded in one dimension. The topological nature of
the band touching points of the semimetallic phase in 3D is explicitly
established both analytically and numerically from the 1D perspective. This
dimensional reduction provides a simple protocol to experimentally construct
the three dimensional Brillouin zone of the topological semimetallic phases
using `legos' of simple 1D double well optical lattices. We also propose Zak
phase imaging of optical lattices as a tool to capture the topological nature
of the band touching points. Our work provides a theoretical connection between
the commensurate AAH model in 1D and Weyl semimetals in 3D, and points toward
practical methods for the laboratory realization of such three dimensional
topological systems in atomic optical lattices.

equivalent width (WLy{\alpha}) distribution at z~6. We explored two simple
evolutionary scenarios: smooth evolution where Lyman-alpha is attenuated in all
galaxies by a constant factor (perhaps owing to processes from galaxy evolution
or a slowly increasing IGM opacity), and patchy evolution where Lyman-alpha is
blocked in some fraction of galaxies (perhaps due to the IGM being opaque along
only some fraction of sightlines). The Bayesian formalism places stronger
constraints compared with the direct method. Combining our data with that in
the literature we find that at z~8 the Lyman-alpha fraction has dropped by a
factor >3(84% confidence interval) using both the smooth and patchy scenarios

data favor the patchy scenario over smooth (with ""positive"" Bayesian evidence),
extending trends observed at z~7 to higher redshift. If this decrease is a
result of reionization as predicted by theory, then our data imply the volume
averaged neutral hydrogen fraction in the IGM to be >0.3 suggesting that the

50-70% of their total stellar mass between 12.5 and 5 Gyr ago (z$\sim$5-0.5)
and both were abruptly quenched $\sim$ 5 Gyr ago (z$\sim$0.5). The predominance
of intermediate age populations in And XVI makes it qualitatively different
from faint companions of the MW and clearly not a pre-reionization fossil.
Neither And II nor And XVI appears to have a clear analog among MW companions,
and the degree of similarity in the SFHs of And II and And XVI is not seen
among comparably faint-luminous pairs of MW satellites. These findings provide
hints that satellite galaxy evolution may vary substantially among hosts of
similar stellar mass. Although comparably deep observations of more M31

the need for caution when interpreting satellite galaxies of an individual

fit T(cold). We compare T(cold) and beta with star formation rates (calculated
from L(Halpha) and L(24)), the luminosity of the old stellar population (traced
through L(3.6), and the dust mass surface density (traced by 500 micron
luminosity, L(500)). We find a significant trend between SFR/L(500) and
T(cold), implying that the flux of hard UV photons relative to the amount of
dust is significantly contributing to the heating of the cold, or diffuse, dust

the old stellar population contributes to the heating at far-IR/submillimeter

show that such a screen behaves like a viscous bubble with a surface tension
and an internal energy, and that the Einstein equations take the same forms as
non-equilibrium thermodynamic equations for a viscous bubble. We provide a
consistent dictionary between gravitational and thermodynamical variables. In
the non-viscous cases there are three thermodynamic equations which
characterize a bubble dynamics: These are the first law, the Marangoni flow
equation and the Young-Laplace equation. In all three equations the surface
tension plays a central role: In the first law it appears as a work term per
unit area, in the Marangoni flow its gradient drives a force, and in the
Young-Laplace equation it contributes to a pressure proportional to the surface
curvature. The gravity equations appear as a natural generalization of these
bubble equations when the bubble itself is viscous and dynamical. In
particular, it shows that the mechanism of entropy production for the viscous
bubble is mapped onto the production of gravitational waves. We also review the
relationship between surface tension and temperature, and discuss black-hole
thermodynamics.

nonthermal emission, and the nature of TeV emission has been continuously
debated for nearly a decade.
  Aims: We carry out the detailed modeling of the radio to gamma-ray spectrum
of HESS J1731-347 to constrain the magnetic field and energetic particles
sources, which we compare with those of the other TeV-bright shell-type SNRs
explored before.
  Methods: Four years of data from Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)
observations for regions around this remnant are analyzed, leading to no
detection correlated with the source discovered in the TeV band. The Markov
Chain Monte Carlo method is used to constrain parameters of one-zone models for
the overall emission spectrum.
  Results: Based on the 99.9% upper limits of fluxes in the GeV range, one-zone
hadronic models with an energetic proton spectral slope greater than 1.8 can be
ruled out, which favors a leptonic origin for the gamma-ray emission, making
this remnant a sibling of the brightest TeV SNR RX J1713.7-3946, the Vela
Junior SNR RX J0852.0-4622, and RCW 86. The best-fit leptonic model has an
electron spectral slope of 1.8 and a magnetic field of about 30 muG, which is
at least a factor of 2 higher than those of RX J1713.7-3946 and RX
J0852.0-4622, posing a challenge to the distance estimate and/or the energy
equipartition between energetic electrons and the magnetic field of this
source. A measurement of the shock speed will address this challenge and has
implications on the magnetic field evolution and electron acceleration driven
by shocks of SNRs.

changes of the environment conditions. For the revised algorithm, the
incremental voltage change step size is adaptively adjusted based on the slope
of the power-voltage (P-V) curve. An accelerating factor and a decelerating
factor are further applied to adjust the voltage step change considering
whether the sign of the P-V curve slope remains the same or not in a subsequent
tracking step. In addition, the upper bound of the maximum voltage step change
is also updated considering the information of sign changes. The revised MPPT
algorithm can quickly track the maximum power points (MPPs) and remove the
oscillation of the actual operation points around the real MPPs. The
effectiveness of the revised algorithm is demonstrated using a simulation.

algorithm designed to sample from a given target distribution \pi with Lebesgue
density on R^N. RWM constructs a Markov chain by randomly proposing a new
position (the ""proposal move""), which is then accepted or rejected according to
a rule which makes the chain reversible with respect to \pi. When the dimension
N is large a key question is to determine the optimal scaling with N of the
proposal variance: if the proposal variance is too large, the algorithm will
reject the proposed moves too often; if it is too small, the algorithm will
explore the state space too slowly. Determining the optimal scaling of the
proposal variance gives a measure of the cost of the algorithm as well. One
approach to tackle this issue, which we adopt here, is to derive diffusion
limits for the algorithm. Such an approach has been proposed in the seminal
papers [RGG97, RR98]; in particular in [RGG97] the authors derive a diffusion
limit for the RWM algorithm under the two following assumptions: i) the
algorithm is started in stationarity; ii) the target measure $\pi$ is in
product form. The present paper considers the situation of practical interest
in which both assumptions i) and ii) are removed. That is a) we study the case
(which occurs in practice) in which the algorithm is started out of
stationarity and b) we consider target measures which are in non-product form.
The target measures that we consider arise in Bayesian nonparametric statistics
and in the study of conditioned diffusions. We prove that, out of stationarity,
the optimal scaling for the proposal variance is O(N), as it is in
stationarity. Notice that the optimal scaling in and out of stationatity need
not be the same in general, and indeed they differ e.g. in the case of the MALA
algorithm [KOS16].

columns that will receive zero weight in a solution of the corresponding lasso
problem. These columns can be removed from the dictionary prior to solving the
lasso problem without impacting the optimality of the solution obtained. This
has two potential advantages: it reduces the size of the dictionary, allowing
the lasso problem to be solved with less resources, and it may speed up
obtaining a solution. Using a geometrically intuitive framework, we provide
basic insights for understanding useful lasso screening tests and their

that (c) is false and the infalling observer burns up at the horizon (the
horizon acts as a ""firewall""). However, the firewall violates the equivalence
principle and breaks the CPT invariance of quantum gravity. This led Hawking to
propose recently that gravitational collapse may not end up producing event
horizons, although he did not give a mechanism for how this may happen. Here we
will support Hawking's conclusion in a quantum gravitational model of dust
collapse. We will show that continued collapse to a singularity can only be
achieved by combining two independent and entire solutions of the

combination, which leads naturally to a picture in which matter condenses on

fundamental requirement to reach the standard quantum limit (SQL) for force
measurement, in optomechanical systems. However, thermal fluctuating force
generally dominates a disturbance on the oscillator. In the macroscopic scale,
an optical linear cavity including a suspended mirror has been used for the
weak force measurement, such as gravitational-wave detectors. This
configuration has the advantages of reducing the dissipation of the pendulum
(i.e., suspension thermal noise) due to a gravitational dilution by using a
thin wire, and of increasing the circulating laser power. However, the use of
the thin wire is weak for an optical torsional anti-spring effect in the
cavity, due to the low mechanical restoring force of the wire. Thus, there is
the trade-off between the stability of the system and the sensitivity. Here, we
describe using a triangular optical cavity to overcome this limitation for
reaching the SQL. The triangular cavity can provide a sensitive and stable
system, because it can optically trap the mirror's motion of the yaw, through
an optical positive torsional spring effect. To show this, we demonstrate a
measurement of the torsional spring effect caused by radiation pressure forces.

for the origin of our Universe, is strongly supported by the recent results of
the Planck satellite and the BICEP2 experiment. The results from Planck,
however, also confirm the presence of a number of anomalies in the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB), whose origin becomes problematic in single-field
inflation. Among the most prominent and well-tested of these anomalies is the
Cold Spot, which constitutes the only significant deviation from gaussianity in
the CMB. Planck's non-detection of primordial non-gaussianity on smaller scales
thus suggests the existence of a physical mechanism whereby significant
non-gaussianity is generated on large angular scales only. In this letter, we
address this question by developing a localized version of the inhomogeneous
reheating scenario, which postulates the existence of a scalar field able to
modify the decay of the inflaton on localized spatial regions only. We
demonstrate that if the Cold Spot is due to an overdensity in the last
scattering surface, the localization mechanism offers a feasible explanation
for it, thus providing a physical mechanism for the generation of localized
non-gaussianity in the CMB. If, on the contrary, the Cold Spot is caused by a
newly discovered supervoid (as recently claimed), we argue that the
localization mechanism, while managing to enhance underdensities, may well shed
light on the rarity of the discovered supervoid.

that, due partly to their specialized/topical nature, sets of reviews authored

In practice, this means that individuals who author more than a few reviews

be linked, which represents a significant loss of privacy.
  In this paper, we start by showing that the problem is actually worse than
previously believed. We then explore ways to mitigate authorship linkability in
community-based reviewing. We first attempt to harness the global power of
crowdsourcing by engaging random strangers into the process of re-writing
reviews. As our empirical results (obtained from Amazon Mechanical Turk)
clearly demonstrate, crowdsourcing yields impressively sensible reviews that
reflect sufficiently different stylometric characteristics such that prior
stylometric linkability techniques become largely ineffective. We also consider
using machine translation to automatically re-write reviews. Contrary to what
was previously believed, our results show that translation decreases authorship
linkability as the number of intermediate languages grows. Finally, we explore
the combination of crowdsourcing and machine translation and report on the
results.

on the temporal decay results in \cite{cs}, we find that one can obtain
weighted estimates of the magnetic field $B$ by direct weighted energy
estimate, and then by regarding the magnetic convection term as a forcing term
in the velocity equations, we can obtain the weighted estimates for the
vorticity, which yields the corresponding estimates for the velocity field. The
higher order derivative estimates will be obtained by using a parabolic
interpolation inequality proved in \cite{k01}. It should be emphasized that the
the magnetic field has stronger decay properties than the velocity field in the
sense that there is no restriction on the exponent of the weight. The same
arguments also yield the sharp space-time decay rates for strong solutions to
the usual MHD equations.

erupted on 2012 July 12 and caused a strong geomagnetic storm event on July 15.
Through analyzing the long-term evolution of the associated active region
observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, it is found that the twisted
field of an MFR, indicated by a continuous S-shaped sigmoid, is built up from
two groups of sheared arcades near the main polarity inversion line half day
before the eruption. The temperature within the twisted field and sheared
arcades is higher than that of the ambient volume, suggesting that magnetic
reconnection most likely works there. The driver behind the reconnection is
attributed to shearing and converging motions at magnetic footpoints with
velocities in the range of 0.1--0.6 km s$^{-1}$. The rotation of the preceding
sunspot also contributes to the MFR buildup. Extrapolated three-dimensional
non-linear force-free field structures further reveal the locations of the
reconnection to be in a bald-patch region and in a hyperbolic flux tube. About
two hours before the eruption, indications for a second MFR in the form of an
S-shaped hot channel are seen. It lies above the original MFR that continuously
exists and includes a filament. The whole structure thus makes up a stable
double-decker MFR system for hours prior to the eruption. Eventually, after
entering the domain of instability, the high-lying MFR impulsively erupts to
generate a fast coronal mass ejection and X-class flare; while the low-lying
MFR remains behind and continuously maintains the sigmoidicity of the active
region.

action that reduces to the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian with a cosmological
constant $\Lambda$ and a scalar field whose dynamics is governed by its usual
kinetic term together with a nonminimal kinetic coupling. Requiring the radial
component of the conserved current to vanish, the solution turns out to be the
BTZ black hole geometry with a radial scalar field well-defined at the horizon.
This means in particular that the stress tensor associated to the matter source
behaves on-shell as an effective cosmological constant term. We construct an
Euclidean action whose field equations are consistent with the original ones
and such that the constraint on the radial component of the conserved current
also appears as a field equation. With the help of this Euclidean action, we
derive the mass and the entropy of the solution, and found that they are
proportional to the thermodynamical quantities of the BTZ solution by an
overall factor that depends on the cosmological constant. The reality condition
and the positivity of the mass impose the cosmological constant to be bounded
from above as $\Lambda\leq-\frac{1}{l^2}$ where the limiting case
$\Lambda=-\frac{1}{l^2}$ reduces to the BTZ solution with a vanishing scalar
field. Exploiting a scaling symmetry of the reduced action, we also obtain the
usual three-dimensional Smarr formula. In the last section, we extend all these
results in higher dimensions where the metric turns out to be the

conductivity is calculated using a phonon ensemble Monte Carlo simulation, with
a real-space rough surface described by a Gaussian autocorrelation function.
Throughout the temperature range, the Seebeck coefficient increases while the
lattice thermal conductivity decreases with decreasing wire cross section, both
boding well for TE applications of thin GaN NWs. However, at room temperature
these benefits are eventually overcome by the detrimental effect of surface
roughness scattering on the electron mobility in very thin NWs. The highest
room-temperature $ZT$ of 0.2 is achieved for 4-nm-thick NWs, while further
downscaling degrades it. In contrast, at 1000 K, the electron mobility varies
weakly with the NW thickness owing to the dominance of polar optical phonon
scattering and multiple subbands contributing to transport, so $ZT$ increases
with increasing confinement, reaching 0.8 for optimally doped 3-nm-thick NWs.
The $ZT$ of GaN NWs increases with increasing temperature beyond 1000 K, which

point. Early in 2014, several results were published demonstrating that several
experimental technologies are now accurate enough to satisfy the requirements
of fault-tolerant, error corrected quantum computation. While there are many
technological and experimental issues that still need to be solved, the ability
of experimental systems to now have error rates low enough to satisfy the
fault-tolerant threshold for several error correction models is a tremendous
milestone. Consequently, it is now a good time for the computer science and
classical engineering community to examine the {\em classical} problems
associated with compiling quantum algorithms and implementing them on future
quantum hardware. In this paper, we will review the basic operational rules of
a topological quantum computing architecture and outline one of the most
important classical problems that need to be solved; the decoding of error
correction data for a large-scale quantum computer. We will endeavour to
present these problems independently from the underlying physics as much of
this work can be effectively solved by non-experts in quantum information or
quantum mechanics.

by $\lambda_k(M,g)$ the $k$-th eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on
$(M,g)$. In this paper, we consider the mapping $(M, g)\mapsto \lambda_k(M,g)$.
We propose a computational method for finding the conformal spectrum
$\Lambda^c_k(M,[g_0])$, which is defined by the eigenvalue optimization problem
of maximizing $\lambda_k(M,g)$ for $k$ fixed as $g$ varies within a conformal
class $[g_0]$ of fixed volume $textrm{vol}(M,g) = 1$. We also propose a
computational method for the problem where $M$ is additionally allowed to vary
over surfaces with fixed genus, $\gamma$. This is known as the topological
spectrum for genus $\gamma$ and denoted by $\Lambda^t_k(\gamma)$. Our
computations support a conjecture of N. Nadirashvili (2002) that
$\Lambda^t_k(0) = 8 \pi k$, attained by a sequence of surfaces degenerating to
a union of $k$ identical round spheres. Furthermore, based on our computations,
we conjecture that $\Lambda^t_k(1) = \frac{8\pi^2}{\sqrt{3}} + 8\pi (k-1)$,
attained by a sequence of surfaces degenerating into a union of an equilateral
flat torus and $k-1$ identical round spheres. The values are compared to
several surfaces where the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalues are well-known,
including spheres, flat tori, and embedded tori. In particular, we show that
among flat tori of volume one, the $k$-th Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalue has a
local maximum with value $\lambda_k = 4\pi^2 \left\lceil \frac{k}{2}
\right\rceil^2 \left( \left\lceil \frac{k}{2} \right\rceil^2 -
\frac{1}{4}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}$. Several properties are also studied
computationally, including uniqueness, symmetry, and eigenvalue multiplicity.

In particular, we show that the problem of maximizing network throughput while

generalized shift invariant systems to a continuous frame theory. To do so, we
let $\Gamma_j$, $j \in J$, be a countable family of closed, co-compact
subgroups of a second countable locally compact abelian group $G$ and study
systems of the form $\cup_{j \in J}\{g_{j,p}(\cdot - \gamma)\}_{\gamma \in
\Gamma_j, p \in P_j}$ with generators $g_{j,p}$ in $L^2(G)$ and with each $P_j$
being a countable or an uncountable index set. We refer to systems of this form
as generalized translation invariant (GTI) systems. Many of the familiar
transforms, e.g., the wavelet, shearlet and Gabor transform, both their
discrete and continuous variants, are GTI systems. Under a technical $\alpha$
local integrability condition ($\alpha$-LIC) we characterize when GTI systems
constitute tight and dual frames that yield reproducing formulas for $L^2(G)$.
This generalizes results on generalized shift invariant systems, where each
$P_j$ is assumed to be countable and each $\Gamma_j$ is a uniform lattice in
$G$, to the case of uncountably many generators and (not necessarily discrete)
closed, co-compact subgroups. Furthermore, even in the case of uniform lattices
$\Gamma_j$, our characterizations improve known results since the class of GTI
systems satisfying the $\alpha$-LIC is strictly larger than the class of GTI
systems satisfying the previously used local integrability condition. As an
application of our characterization results, we obtain new characterizations of
translation invariant continuous frames and Gabor frames for $L^2(G)$. In
addition, we will see that the admissibility conditions for the continuous and

a new synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurement, over a wide momentum transfer
(Q-)range, has been performed. These x-ray data have been interpreted together
with a neutron diffraction dataset, measured earlier, using the reverse Monte
Carlo method. The structure is analysed on the basis of partial radial
distribution functions and distance dependent orientational correlation
functions. Orientational correlations behave similarly to other carbon
tetrahalides. Moreover, the information content of the new x-ray diffraction
data set, and in particular, of the varying Q-range, is also discussed.
  Only very small differences have been found between results of calculations
that apply one single experimental structure factor and the ones that use both
x-ray and neutron diffraction data: the latter showed slightly more ordered
carbon-carbon radial distribution function, which resulted in seemingly more
ordered orientational correlations between pairs of molecules. Neither the
extended Q-range, nor the application of local invariance constraints yielded
significant new information. For providing a simple reference system, a hard
sphere model has also been created that can describe most of the partial radial
distribution functions and orientational correlations of the real system at a
semi-quantitative level.

have the same status as, say, the equations describing an emergent phenomenon

thermodynamic variational principle in which a set of normalized vector fields
are varied rather than the metric. We show that this variational principle can
arise as a low energy ($L_P = (G\hbar/c^3)^{1/2} \to 0$) relic of a plausible
nonperturbative effect of quantum gravity, viz. the existence of a
zero-point-length in the spacetime. Our result is nonperturbative in the
following sense: If we modify the geodesic distance in a spacetime by
introducing a zero-point-length, to incorporate some effects of quantum
gravity, and take the limit $L_P \to 0$ of the Ricci scalar of the modified
metric, we end up getting a nontrivial, leading order ($L_P$ - independent)
term. \textit{This term is identical to the expression for entropy density of
spacetime used previously in the emergent gravity approach.} This reconfirms
the idea that the microscopic degrees of freedom of the spacetime, when
properly described in the full theory, could lead to an effective description
of geometry in terms of a thermodynamic variational principle. This is
conceptually similar to the emergence of thermodynamics from mechanics of, say,
molecules. The approach also has important implications for cosmological
constant which are briefly discussed.

a temperature close to the Gd$_{3}$Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$ magnetic compensation point
at around 280 K. There the spin Seebeck signal changes sign abruptly with
unaltered amplitude, indicating that the spin current is mainly caused by the
magnetic Fe sub-lattices, which reorient their directions at this temperature.
A second, more gradual sign change takes place around the ordering temperature
of the Gd sub-lattice in the range of 65-85 K, showing that the Gd magnetic
sub-lattice dominates the thermally driven spin current at lower temperatures.
These sign changes together with the non-monotonous dependence of the spin
Seebeck signal on the temperature demonstrate that the magnonic spin current is
not simply replicating the effective magnetization of Gd$_{3}$Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$.
Rather, the thermally generated net spin current results from a complex
interplay of the three magnetic sub-lattices involved.

the readout of detector signals, since the sampling frequency of typically
several gigasamples per second allows excellent pile-up rejection and time
measurements. They suffer however from the fact that their sampling bins are
not equidistant in time, given by limitations of the chip process. In the past,
this limited time measurements of optimal signals to standard deviations
({\sigma}) of about 4-25 ps in accuracy for the split pulse test, depending on
the specific chip. This paper introduces a novel time calibration, which
determines the true sampling speed of an SCA. Additionally, for two
independently running SCA chips, the achieved time resolution improved to less
than 3 ps ({\sigma}) independently from the delay for the split pulse test,
when simply applying a linear interpolation. When using a more advanced
analyzing technique for the split pulse test with a single SCA, this limit is
pushed below 1 ps ({\sigma}) for delays up to 8 ns. Various test measurements
with different boards based on the DRS4 ASIC indicate that the new calibration
is stable over time but not over larger temperature variations.

Repositories are typically distributed and geographically remote, but data are
interconnected (e.g., the Semantic Web) and queried globally by a language such
as SPARQL. Due to the network cost and the nature of the queries, the execution
time can be prohibitively high. Current solutions attempt to minimize the
network cost by redistributing all data in a preprocessing phase, but here are
two drawbacks: (i) redistribution is based on heuristics that may not benefit
many of the future queries; and (ii) the preprocessing phase is very expensive
even for moderate size datasets. In this paper we propose PHD-Store, a SPARQL
engine for distributed RDF repositories. Our system does not assume any
particular initial data placement and does not require prepartitioning; hence,
it minimizes the startup cost. Initially, PHD-Store answers queries using a
potentially slow distributed semi-join algorithm, but adapts dynamically to the
query load by incrementally redistributing frequently accessed data.
Redistribution is done in a way that future queries can benefit from fast
hash-based parallel execution. Our experiments with synthetic and real data
verify that PHD-Store scales to very large datasets; many repositories;
converges to comparable or better quality of partitioning than existing
methods; and executes large query loads 1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster than
our competitors.

redshift quasars, PG 0844 + 349 (z=0.064), PG 1226 + 023 (z=0.158), and PG
1426+015 (z=0.086). The observations were done by using the Infrared Camera and
Spectrograph (IRCS) at the Subaru 8.2 m telescope. The full width at half
maximum of the point spread function was about 0.3 arcsec by operations of an
adaptive optics system, which can effectively resolve the quasar spectra from
the host galaxy spectra. We spent up to several hours per target and developed
data reduction methods to reduce the systematic noises of the telluric
emissions and absorptions. From the obtained spectra, we identified absorption
features of Mg I (1.503 um), Si I (1.589 um) and CO (6-3) (1.619 um), and
measured the velocity dispersions of PG 0844 + 349 to be 132+/-110 km s-1 and
PG 1426 + 015 to be 264+/-215 km s-1. By using an M_BH-sigma relation of
elliptical galaxies, we derived the black hole (BH) mass of PG 0844+349,
log(M_BH/M_SUN) = 7.7+/-5.5 and PG 1426+015, log(M_BH/M_SUN) = 9.0+/-7.5. These
values are consistent with the BH mass values from broad emission lines with an
assumption of a virial factor of 5.5.

tetrablock, a polynomially convex and non-convex domain in $\mathbb C^3$,
defined as $$ \mathbb E = \{ (x_1,x_2,x_3)\in\mathbb C^3\,:\,
1-zx_1-wx_2+zwx_3\neq 0 \textup{ whenever } |z|\leq 1, |w|\leq 1 \}. $$ A
commuting triple of operators $(T_1,T_2,T_3)$ for which the closed tetrablock
$\overline{\mathbb E}$ is a spectral set, is called an $\mathbb E$-contraction.
For an $\mathbb E$-contraction $(T_1,T_2,T_3)$, the two operator equations $$
T_1-T_2^*T_3=D_{T_3}X_1D_{T_3} \textup{ and } T_2-T_1^*T_3= D_{T_3}X_2D_{T_3},
\quad D_{T_3}=(I-T_3^*T_3)^{\frac{1}{2}},$$ have unique solutions $A_1,A_2$ on
$\mathcal D_{T_3}=\overline{Ran} D_{T_3}$ and they are called the fundamental
operators of $(T_1,T_2,T_3)$. For a particular class of $\mathbb
E$-contractions, we prove it necessary for the existence of rational dilation
that the corresponding fundamental operators $A_1,A_2$ satisfy the conditions
\begin{equation}\label{abstract} A_1A_2=A_2A_1 \textup{ and }
A_1^*A_1-A_1A_1^*=A_2^*A_2-A_2A_2^*. \end{equation} Then we construct an
$\mathbb E$-contraction from that particular class which fails to satisfy
(\ref{abstract}). We produce a concrete functional model for pure $\mathbb
E$-isometries, a class of $E$-contractions analogous to the pure isometries in
one variable. The fundamental operators play the main role in this model.

strongly Mg-enhanced stars based on the low-resolution $(R\simeq2000)$ spectra
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is carried out by finding the best
matched synthetic spectrum to the observed one in the region of Mg I b lines
around $\lambda$5170\AA$~$via a profile matching method. The advantage of our
method is that fitting parameters are refined by reproducing the [Mg/Fe] ratios
of 47 stars from very precise high-resolution spectroscopic (HRS) analysis by
Nissen and Schuster (2010); and these parameters are crucial to the precision
and validity of the derived Mg abundances. As a further check of our method, Mg
abundances are estimated with our method for member stars in four Galactic
globular clusters (M92, M13, M3, M71) which cover the same metallicity range as
our sample, and the results are in good agreement with those of HRS analysis in
the literature. The validation of our method is also proved by the agreement of
[Mg/Fe] between our values and those of HRS analysis by Aoki et al.(2013).
Finally, 33 candidates of strongly Mg-enhanced stars with [Mg/Fe]$>$1.0 are
selected from 14850 F and G stars. Follow-up observations will be carried out
on these candidates with high-resolution spectroscopy by large telescopes in
the near future, so as to check our selection procedure and to perform a
precise and detailed abundance analysis and to explore the origins of these

decay function to reproduce the recovery phase, instead of the exponential
function. A superposed epoch analysis of recovery phases of intense storms from

subsets. The hyperbolic decay function reproduces experimental data better than
what the exponential function does for any subset of storms, which indicates a
non-linear coupling between dDst/dt and Dst. Moreover, this kind of
mathematical function, where the degree of reduction of the Dst index depends

largely unexplored question in collective social phenomena. Whether
individuals' decisions are taken in a pure strategic basis or due to social
pressure without a rational background crucially influences the model outcome.
Here we study a networked Prisoner's Dilemma in which decisions are made either
based on the replication of the most successful neighbor's strategy
(unconditional imitation) or by pure social imitation following an update rule
inspired by the voter model. The main effects of the voter dynamics are an
enhancement of the final consensus, i.e., asymptotic states are generally
uniform, and a promotion of cooperation in certain regions of the parameter
space as compared to the outcome of purely strategic updates. Thus, voter
dynamics acts as an interface noise and has a similar effect to a pure random
noise; furthermore, its influence is mostly independent of the network
heterogeneity. When strategic decisions are made following other update rules
such as the replicator or Moran processes, the dynamic mixed state found under
unconditional imitation for some parameters disappears, but an increase of
cooperation in certain parameter regions is still observed. Comparing our
results with recent experiments on the Prisoner's Dilemma, we conclude that
such a mixed dynamics may explain moody conditional cooperation among the
agents.

relatively low correlations. Principal component analysis shows that most

eigenvectors contain rich economic information. Specifically, the largest
eigenvalue reflects a collective effect of the global market, other four
largest eigenvalues possess a partitioning function to distinguish the six
clusters, and the smallest eigenvalues highlight the pairs of time series with
the largest correlation coefficients. We construct an index of the global oil

to incorporate such effects. There still exists but a controversy on how to do
it in a proper and computationally efficient way. Here we introduce an improved
Langevin description of stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics with natural
boundary conditions for gating variables. It consistently describes the channel
noise variance in a good agreement with discrete state model. Moreover, we show
by comparison with our improved Langevin model that two earlier Langevin models

  Substructure Without Jets","11 figures",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wavelet decomposition is a method that has been applied to signal processing
in a wide range of subjects. The decomposition isolates small scale features of
a signal from large scale features, while also maintaining information about
where in the signal those features occur. Wavelets obey particular scaling
relations and are especially suited to the analysis of systems that are
self-similar and scale invariant. They are therefore a natural tool for the
study of hadron collisions.
  This paper introduces the use of wavelets for de-noising (removal of soft
activity), studying the scaling behaviour of a shower, and recognising jets
according to this behaviour. This is demonstrated by processing a sample of
boosted W boson Monte Carlo events together with their QCD background. The
method is quite general and can be used as a pre-processing step in conjunction
with any jet-finder or other event-shape algorithm. The result in this simple
example is a significant enhancement in both the size and shape of the W boson
mass peak, together with an improved separation of the background distribution.

Microkelvin Imager (AMI), a ground-based radio interferometer. AMI provides an
independent measurement with higher angular resolution, 3 arcmin compared to
the Planck beams of 5-10 arcmin. The AMI observations thus provide validation
of the cluster detections, improved positional estimates, and a consistency
check on the fitted 'size' ($\theta_{s}$) and 'flux' ($Y_{\rm tot}$) parameters
in the Generalised Navarro, Frenk and White (GNFW) model. We detect 99 of the

and error-bars produced by the Planck algorithms PowellSnakes and MMF3. We find
that $Y_{\rm tot}$ values as measured by AMI are biased downwards with respect
to the Planck constraints, especially for high Planck-SNR clusters. We perform
simulations to show that this can be explained by deviation from the
'universal' pressure profile shape used to model the clusters. We show that AMI
data can constrain the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters describing the shape of
the profile in the GNFW model for individual clusters provided careful
attention is paid to the degeneracies between parameters, but one requires
information on a wider range of angular scales than are present in AMI data

$T^2$-test has been modified to work for a high-dimensional mean, and the

computational security for single user systems. Leveraging recent results from
its analysis, we extend the remit and utility of the framework to the
quantification of the computational security for multi-user systems. In
particular, assume that $V$ users independently select strings stochastically
from a finite, but potentially large, list. An inquisitor who does not know
which strings have been selected wishes to identify $U$ of them. The inquisitor
knows the selection probabilities of each user and is equipped with a method
that enables the testing of each (user, string) pair, one at a time, for
whether that string had been selected by that user.
  Here we establish that, unless $U=V$, there is no general strategy that
minimizes the distribution of the number of guesses, but in the asymptote as
the strings become long we prove the following: by construction, there is an
asymptotically optimal class of strategies; the number of guesses required in
an asymptotically optimal strategy satisfies a large deviation principle with a
rate function, which is not necessarily convex, that can be determined from the
rate functions of optimally guessing individual users' strings; if all user's
selection statistics are identical, the exponential growth rate of the average
guesswork as the string-length increases is determined by the specific R\'enyi
entropy of the string-source with parameter $(V-U+1)/(V-U+2)$, generalizing the
known $V=U=1$ case; and that the Shannon entropy of the source is a lower bound
on the average guesswork growth rate for all $U$ and $V$, thus providing a
bound on computational security for multi-user systems. Examples are presented
to illustrate these results and their ramifications for systems design.

we studied dispersal in the context of bacterial range expansions and
identified the major determinants of species coexistence for a bacterial model
system of three Escherichia coli strains (toxin producing, sensitive, and
resistant). Genetic engineering allowed us to tune strain growth rates and to
design different ecological scenarios (cyclic and hierarchical). We found that
coexistence of all strains depended on three strongly interdependent factors:
composition of inoculum, relative strain growth rates, and effective toxin
range. Robust agreement between our experiments and a thoroughly calibrated
computational model enabled us to extrapolate these intricate interdependencies
in terms of phenomenological biodiversity laws. Our mathematical analysis also
suggested that cyclic dominance between strains is not a prerequisite for
coexistence in competitive range expansions. Instead, robust three-strain
coexistence required a balance between growth rates and either a reduced
initial ratio of the toxin-producing strain, or a sufficiently short toxin
range.

system can evolve into. For systems in contact with a heat bath, it can be
combined with the law of energy conservation, and it says that a system can
only evolve into another if the free energy goes down. Recently, it's been
shown that there are actually many second laws, and that it is only for large
macroscopic systems that they all become equivalent to the ordinary one. These
additional second laws also hold for quantum systems, and are, in fact, often
more relevant in this regime. They place a restriction on how the probabilities
of energy levels can evolve. Here, we consider additional restrictions on how
the coherences between energy levels can evolve. Coherences can only go down,
and we provide a set of restrictions which limit the extent to which they can
be maintained. We find that coherences over energy levels must decay at rates
that are suitably adapted to the transition rates between energy levels. We
show that the limitations are matched in the case of a single qubit, in which
case we obtain the full characterization of state-to-state transformations. For
higher dimensions, we conjecture that more severe constraints exist. We also
introduce a new class of thermodynamical operations which allow for greater
manipulation of coherences and study its power with respect to a class of
operations known as thermal operations.

procedure can be controlled by three parameters: A static potential tilt, a
voltage offset at the critical point, and the total duration of the process. We
show how to optimize the control parameters by measurements of ion distances,
trap frequencies and the final motional excitation. At a separation duration of
$80 \mu$s, we achieve a minimum mean excitation of $\bar{n} = 4.16(0.16)$

rely on complex body models and a large variety of geometric constraints. We
argue that this is not ideal and somewhat inelegant as it results in large
processing burdens, and instead attempt to incorporate these constraints
through priors obtained directly from training data. A prior distribution
covering the probability of a human pose occurring is used to incorporate
likely human poses. This distribution is obtained offline, by fitting a
Gaussian mixture model to a large dataset of recorded human body poses, tracked
using a Kinect sensor. We combine this prior information with a random walk
transition model to obtain an upper body model, suitable for use within a
recursive Bayesian filtering framework. Our model can be viewed as a mixture of
discrete Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, in that states behave as random walks,
but drift towards a set of typically observed poses. This model is combined
with measurements of the human head and hand positions, using recursive
Bayesian estimation to incorporate temporal information. Measurements are
obtained using face detection and a simple skin colour hand detector, trained
using the detected face. The suggested model is designed with analytical
tractability in mind and we show that the pose tracking can be
Rao-Blackwellised using the mixture Kalman filter, allowing for computational
efficiency while still incorporating bio-mechanical properties of the upper
body. In addition, the use of the proposed upper body model allows reliable
three-dimensional pose estimates to be obtained indirectly for a number of
joints that are often difficult to detect using traditional object recognition
strategies. Comparisons with Kinect sensor results and the state of the art in
2D pose estimation highlight the efficacy of the proposed approach.

harbour two stars, some of which have binary semi-major axes as small as 20 au.
It is well known that the formation of planets in such systems is strongly
influenced by the stellar components, since the protoplanetary disc and the
particles within are exposed to the gravitational influence of the binary.
However, the question on how self-gravitating protoplanetary bodies affect the
evolution of a radiative, circumprimary disc is still open. Aims. We present
our 2D hydrodynamical GPU-CPU code and study the interaction of several
thousands of self-gravitating particles with a viscous and radiative
circumprimary disc within a binary star system. To our knowledge this program
is the only one at the moment that is capable to handle this many particles and
to calculate their influence on each other and on the disc. Methods. We
performed hydrodynamical simulations of a circumstellar disc assuming the
binary system to be coplanar. Our gridbased staggered mesh code relies on ideas
from ZEUS-2D, where we implemented the FARGO algorithm and an additional energy
equation for the radiative cooling according to opacity tables. To treat
particle motion we used a parallelised version of the precise Bulirsch - Stoer
algorithm. Four models in total where computed taking into account (i) only
N-body interaction, (ii) N-body and disc interaction, (iii) the influence of
computational parameters (especially smoothing) on N-body interaction, and (iv)
the influence of a quiet low-eccentricity disc while running model (ii). The
impact velocities where measured at two different time intervals and were
compared. Results. We show that the combination of disc- and N-body
self-gravity can have a significant influence on the orbit evolution of roughly
Moon sized protoplanets.

for variety and the demand for uniformity in music. In this work we quantify
these two notions in terms of musical instrumentation and production
technologies that are typically involved in crafting popular music. We assign a
""complexity value"" to each music style. A style is complex if it shows the
property of having both high variety and low uniformity in instrumentation. We
find a strong inverse relation between variety and uniformity of music styles
that is remarkably stable over the last half century. Individual styles,
however, show dramatic changes in their ""complexity"" during that period. Styles
like ""new wave"" or ""disco"" quickly climbed towards higher complexity in the 70s
and fell back to low complexity levels shortly afterwards, whereas styles like
""folk rock"" remained at constant high complexity levels. We show that changes
in the complexity of a style are related to its number of sales and to the
number of artists contributing to that style. As a style attracts a growing
number of artists, its instrumentational variety usually increases. At the same
time the instrumentational uniformity of a style decreases, i.e. a unique
stylistic and increasingly complex expression pattern emerges. In contrast,
album sales of a given style typically increase with decreasing complexity.
This can be interpreted as music becoming increasingly formulaic once
commercial or mainstream success sets in.

solution depends on its capacity to find a good rate between exploitation of
found so far elements and exploration of the search space. Inspired by natural
phenomena, researchers have developed many successful evolutionary algorithms
which, at original versions, define operators that mimic the way nature solves
complex problems, with no actual consideration of the exploration/exploitation
balance. In this paper, a novel nature-inspired algorithm called the States of
Matter Search (SMS) is introduced. The SMS algorithm is based on the simulation
of the states of matter phenomenon. In SMS, individuals emulate molecules which
interact to each other by using evolutionary operations which are based on the
physical principles of the thermal-energy motion mechanism. The algorithm is
devised by considering each state of matter at one different
exploration/exploitation ratio. The evolutionary process is divided into three
phases which emulate the three states of matter: gas, liquid and solid. In each
state, molecules (individuals) exhibit different movement capacities. Beginning
from the gas state (pure exploration), the algorithm modifies the intensities

transverse momentum, $p_T^{D^*}$, and pseudorapidity, $\eta^{D^*}$, in the
ranges $1.9 < p_T^{D^*} < 20$ GeV and $|\eta^{D^*}|<1.6$. The events were
required to have a virtuality of the incoming photon, $Q^2$, of less than 1

high-statistics measurement at $\sqrt{s} =318$ GeV. This led to the
cancellation of a number of systematic effects both in data and theory.

gives an impression of the module theory with the added adjective ""graded"" to
all its statements. Once the grading is considered to be trivial, the graded
theory reduces to the usual module theory. So from this perspective, the graded
module theory can be considered as an extension of the module theory. However,
one aspect that could be easily missed from such a panoramic view is that, the
graded module theory comes equipped with a shifting, thanks to being able to
partition the structures and rearranging these partitions. This adds an extra
layer of structure (and complexity) to the theory. An sparkling example of this
is the theory of graded Grothendieck groups, K^{gr}_0, which is the main focus
of this monograph. Whereas the usual K_0 is an abelian group, thanks to the
shiftings, K^{gr}_0 has a natural Z[\Gamma]-module structure, where \Gamma is
the graded group. As we will see throughout this note, this extra structure
carries a substantial information about the graded ring.

electronic structure within a uniform magnetic field in three dimensions is
presented. The one-electron system is used to demonstrate the utility of this
new methodology and is a first step in laying the foundation for further
development of many-electron atomic and molecular methodology. It is shown in
this manuscript how to effectively calculate all basis set integrals, which
includes the mixed Gaussian-Sinc integrals, with a fast and accurate method.
The Sinc basis is invariant to the choice of the position of the Coulomb
potential, as opposed to traditional grid based methods. This invariance
guarantees that the choice of the grids origin has no effect on the electronic
structure calculation. This is because the Coulomb potential is treated
properly in this methodology, as opposed to DVR methodologies. The off-diagonal
terms are sparse but very important around the Coulomb singularity. In general,
five to six significant digits of accuracy on all converged results without the
linear dependency problems of the Gaussian methodologies are achievable. This
methodology is applied to calculate the ground state energy of H atom,
$H_2^{+}$ ion and $H_3^{2+}$ ion in magnetic fields up to a magnetic field
strength of 2.35x$10^13$ G (10,000 au). From these calculations it is shown
that $H_3^{2+}$ ion is unstable without relativistic considerations.

classical field theories. The primary focus is on self-interaction: How does an
object's own field affect its motion? General laws governing the self-force and
self-torque are derived using simple, non-perturbative arguments. The relevant
concepts are developed gradually by considering motion in a series of
increasingly complicated theories. Newtonian gravity is discussed first, then
Klein-Gordon theory, electromagnetism, and finally general relativity. Linear
and angular momenta as well as centers of mass are defined in each of these
cases. Multipole expansions for the force and torque are then derived to all
orders for arbitrarily self-interacting extended objects. These expansions are
found to be structurally identical to the laws of motion satisfied by extended
test bodies, except that all relevant fields are replaced by effective versions
which exclude the self-fields in a particular sense. Regularization methods
traditionally associated with self-interacting point particles arise as
straightforward perturbative limits of these (more fundamental) results.
Additionally, generic mechanisms are discussed which dynamically shift ---
i.e., renormalize --- the apparent multipole moments associated with
self-interacting extended bodies. Although this is primarily a synthesis of
earlier work, several new results and interpretations are included as well.

degraded, state-dependent broadcast channels (BCs) with cooperating decoders.
Two different setups are considered and their capacity regions are
characterized. First, we study a setting in which one decoder can use a finite
capacity link to send the other decoder information regarding the messages or
the channel states. In this scenario we analyze two cases: one where noncausal
state information is available to the encoder and the strong decoder and the
other where state information is available only to the encoder in a causal
manner. Second, we examine a setting in which the cooperation between the
decoders is limited to taking place before the outputs of the channel are
given. In this case, one decoder, which is informed of the state sequence
noncausally, can cooperate only to send the other decoder rate-limited
information about the state sequence. The proofs of the capacity regions
introduce a new method of coding for channels with cooperation between
different users, where we exploit the link between the decoders for
multiple-binning. Finally, we discuss the optimality of using rate splitting
techniques when coding for cooperative BCs. In particular, we show that rate
splitting is not necessarily optimal when coding for cooperative BCs by solving
an example in which our method of coding outperforms rate splitting.

that the prominent doping dependence as well as the large values of the

scattering without assuming anisotropic impurity states. Due to the
forward-scattering corrections, the hot spots contribute to the resistive
anisotropy even in the case of strong spin fluctuations, which makes large

deviation theory can be used to determine the equilibrium distribution of a
basic droplet model that underlies a number of important models in material
science and statistical mechanics. The model is simply defined. $K$
distinguishable particles are placed at random onto the $N$ sites of a lattice,
where the ratio $K/N$, the average number of particles per site, equals a
constant $c \in (1,\infty)$. We focus on configurations for which each site is
occupied by at least one particle. The main result is the large deviation
principle (LDP), in the limit where $K \rightarrow \infty$ and $N \rightarrow
\infty$ with $K/N = c$, for a sequence of random, number-density measures,
which are the empirical measures of dependent random variables that count the
droplet sizes. The rate function in the LDP is the relative entropy $R(\theta |
\rho^*)$, where $\theta$ is a possible asymptotic configuration of the
number-density measures and $\rho^*$ is a Poisson distribution restricted to
the set of positive integers. This LDP reveals that $\rho^*$ is the equilibrium
distribution of the number-density measures, which in turn implies that
$\rho^*$ is the equilibrium distribution of the random variables that count the
droplet sizes. We derive the LDP via a local large deviation estimate of the
probability that the number-density measures equal $\theta$ for any probability
measure $\theta$ in the range of these random measures.

has been recently investigated in (Cope 2009, Yu 2011). The set of arms is
either discrete, in which case arms correspond to the vertices of a finite
graph whose structure represents similarity in rewards, or continuous, in which
case arms belong to a bounded interval. For discrete unimodal bandits, we
derive asymptotic lower bounds for the regret achieved under any algorithm, and
propose OSUB, an algorithm whose regret matches this lower bound. Our algorithm
optimally exploits the unimodal structure of the problem, and surprisingly, its
asymptotic regret does not depend on the number of arms. We also provide a
regret upper bound for OSUB in non-stationary environments where the expected
rewards smoothly evolve over time. The analytical results are supported by
numerical experiments showing that OSUB performs significantly better than the
state-of-the-art algorithms. For continuous sets of arms, we provide a brief
discussion. We show that combining an appropriate discretization of the set of
arms with the UCB algorithm yields an order-optimal regret, and in practice,
outperforms recently proposed algorithms designed to exploit the unimodal

  In this work, we observe that the graph under study, or called target graph,

related to an auxiliary graph and an affiliation graph, and the target graph
becomes well connected when we view it from the perspective of these three

When directly sampling the target graph is difficult or inefficient, we can
indirectly sample it efficiently with the assistances of the other two graphs.

probably the size of its key. A famous trend to overcome this issue is to focus
on subclasses of alternant/Goppa codes with a non trivial automorphism group.
Such codes display then symmetries allowing compact parity-check or generator
matrices. For instance, a key-reduction is obtained by taking quasi-cyclic (QC)
or quasi-dyadic (QD) alternant/Goppa codes. We show that the use of such
symmetric alternant/Goppa codes in cryptography introduces a fundamental
weakness. It is indeed possible to reduce the key-recovery on the original
symmetric public-code to the key-recovery on a (much) smaller code that has not
anymore symmetries. This result is obtained thanks to a new operation on codes
called folding that exploits the knowledge of the automorphism group. This
operation consists in adding the coordinates of codewords which belong to the
same orbit under the action of the automorphism group. The advantage is
twofold: the reduction factor can be as large as the size of the orbits, and it
preserves a fundamental property: folding the dual of an alternant (resp.
Goppa) code provides the dual of an alternant (resp. Goppa) code. A key point
is to show that all the existing constructions of alternant/Goppa codes with
symmetries follow a common principal of taking codes whose support is globally
invariant under the action of affine transformations (by building upon prior
works of T. Berger and A. D{\""{u}}r). This enables not only to present a
unified view but also to generalize the construction of QC, QD and even
quasi-monoidic (QM) Goppa codes. All in all, our results can be harnessed to
boost up any key-recovery attack on McEliece systems based on symmetric
alternant or Goppa codes, and in particular algebraic attacks.

and hard to interpret. Ballistic and diffusive heat flow coexist, adding
confusion. This paper looks at a very simple case: a nanoscale crystal repeated
periodically. This is a popular model for simulation of bulk heat transport
using classical molecular dynamics (MD), and is related to transient thermal
grating experiments. Nanoscale effects are seen in perhaps their simplest form.
The model is solved by an extension of standard quasiparticle gas theory of
bulk solids. Both structure and heat flow are constrained by periodic boundary
conditions. Diffusive transport is fully included, while ballistic transport by
phonons of long mean free path is diminished in a specific way. Heat current
J(x) and temperature gradient dT(x')/dx' have a non-local relationship, via
k(x-x'), over a distance |x-x'| determined by phonon mean free paths. In MD
modeling of bulk conductivity, finite computer resources limit system size.
Long mean free paths, comparable to the scale of heating and cooling, cause
undesired finite-size effects that have to be removed by extrapolation. The
present model allows this extrapolation to be quantified. Calculations based on
the Peierls-Boltzmann equation, using a generalized Debye model, show that
extrapolation involves fractional powers of 1/L. It is also argued that heating
and cooling should be distributed sinusoidally (de/dt~cos(2pi x/L)) to improve
convergence of numerics.

ground to first 2+ state excitation energy E2 of a given even-even nucleus,
according to which the energy E2 is expressed in terms of its derivatives with
respect to the neutron and proton numbers. This is based on a similar
derivative equation satisfied by its complementary physical quantity namely the
Reduced Electric Quadrupole Transition Probability B(E2) in a recently
developed model. Although the proposed differential equation for E2 has been
perceived on the basis of its close similarity to B(E2), its theoretical
foundation otherwise has been clearly demonstrated. We further exploit the very
definitions of the derivatives occurring in the differential equation in the
model to obtain two different recursion relations for E2, connecting in each
case three neighboring even-even nuclei from lower to higher mass numbers and
vice-verse. We demonstrate their numerical validity using the available data
throughout the nuclear chart and also explore their possible utility in
predicting the unknown E2 values.

  X-Ray Emission",,,"10.1093/mnras/stu625",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The X-ray emission from a simulated massive stellar cluster is investigated.
The emission is calculated from a 3D hydrodynamical model which incorporates
the mechanical feedback from the stellar winds of 3 O-stars embedded in a giant
molecular cloud clump containing 3240 M$_{\odot}$ of molecular material within
a 4 pc radius. A simple prescription for the evolution of the stars is used,
with the first supernova explosion at t=4.4 Myrs. We find that the presence of
the GMC clump causes short-lived attenuation effects on the X-ray emission of
the cluster. However, once most of the material has been ablated away by the
winds the remaining dense clumps do not have a noticable effect on the
attenuation compared with the assumed interstellar medium column. We determine
the evolution of the cluster X-ray luminosity, L$_X$, and spectra, and generate
synthetic images. The intrinsic X-ray luminosity drops from nearly 10$^{34}$
ergs s$^{-1}$ while the winds are `bottled up', to a near constant value of
1.7$\times 10^{32}\rm ergs s^{-1}$ between t=1-4 Myrs. L$_X$ reduces slightly
during each star's red supergiant stage due to the depressurization of the hot
gas. However, L$_X$ increases to $\approx 10^{34}\rm\,ergs s^{-1}$ during each
star's Wolf-Rayet stage. The X-ray luminosity is enhanced by 2-3 orders of
magnitude to $\sim 10^{37}\rm ergs s^{-1}$ for at least 4600 yrs after each
supernova, at which time the blast wave leaves the grid and the X-ray
luminosity drops. The X-ray luminosity of our simulation is generally
considerably fainter than predicted from spherically-symmetric bubble models,
due to the leakage of hot gas material through gaps in the outer shell. This
process reduces the pressure within our simulation and thus the X-ray emission.
However, the X-ray luminosities and temperatures which we obtain are comparable
to similarly powerful massive young clusters.

other elements of $U_{PMNS}$, may just reflect the fact that, in the limit of
exact mass degeneracy, the leptonic mixing matrix necessarily has a vanishing
element. We show that the lifting of the mass degeneracy can lead to the

solar and atmospheric mixing angles. In the scenario we consider for the
breaking of the mass degeneracy there is only one CP violating phase, already
present in the limit of exact degeneracy, which upon the lifting of the
degeneracy generates both Majorana and Dirac-type CP violation in the leptonic
sector. We analyse some of the correlations among physical observables and
point out that in most of the cases considered, the implied strength of
leptonic Dirac-type CP violation is large enough to be detected in the next

which with a redshift measure. The redshift completeness increases up to about
70% (with an average redshift value of z = 0.85) by restricting to those events
that are bright in the 15-150 keV Swift Burst Alert Telescope energy band. Such
flux-limited sample minimizes any redshift-related selection effects, and can
provide a robust base for the study of the energetics, redshift distribution
and environment of the Swift bright population of SGRBs. For all the events of
the sample we derived the prompt and afterglow emission in both the observer
and (when possible) rest frame and tested the consistency with the correlations
valid for long GRBs. The redshift and intrinsic X-ray absorbing column density
distributions we obtain are consistent with the scenario of SGRBs originated by
the coalescence of compact objects in primordial binaries, with a possible
minor contribution (~10%-25%) of binaries formed by dynamical capture (or
experiencing large natal kicks). This sample is expected to significantly
increase with further years of Swift activity.

homologous jets that occurred at the western edge of NOAA active region 11259
on 2011 July 22. The jets were observed in the seven extreme-ultraviolet (EUV)
filters of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument aboard the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Using the base-difference images of the six filters
(94, 131, 171, 211, 193, and 335 {\AA}), we carried out the differential
emission measure (DEM) analyses to explore the thermodynamic evolutions of the
jets. The jets were accompanied by cool surges observed in the H$\alpha$ line
center of the ground-based telescope in the Big Bear Solar Observatory. The
jets that had lifetimes of 20$-$30 min recurred at the same place for three
times with interval of 40$-$45 min. Interestingly, each of the jets
intermittently experienced several upward eruptions at the speed of 120$-$450
km s$^{-1}$. After reaching the maximum heights, they returned back to the
solar surface, showing near-parabolic trajectories. The falling phases were
more evident in the low-$T$ filters than in the high-$T$ filters, indicating
that the jets experienced cooling after the onset of eruptions. We identified
bright and compact blobs in the jets during their rising phases. The
simultaneous presences of blobs in all the EUV filters were consistent with the
broad ranges of the DEM profiles of the blobs ($5.5\le \log T\le7.5$),
indicating their multi-thermal nature. The median temperatures of the blobs
were $\sim$2.3 MK. The blobs that were $\sim$3 Mm in diameter had lifetimes of
24$-$60 s. To our knowledge, this is the first report of blobs in coronal jets.
We propose that these blobs are plasmoids created by the magnetic reconnection
as a result of tearing-mode instability and ejected out along the jets.

  at CSR 2014 in Moscow, June 7 - 11, 2014",,,,"cs.LO cs.DM math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The aim of this paper is to present a PSPACE algorithm which yields a finite
graph of exponential size and which describes the set of all solutions of
equations in free groups as well as the set of all solutions of equations in
free monoids with involution in the presence of rational constraints. This
became possible due to the recently invented emph{recompression} technique of
the second author.
  He successfully applied the recompression technique for pure word equations
without involution or rational constraints. In particular, his method could not
be used as a black box for free groups (even without rational constraints).
Actually, the presence of an involution (inverse elements) and rational
constraints complicates the situation and some additional analysis is
necessary. Still, the recompression technique is general enough to accommodate
both extensions. In the end, it simplifies proofs that solving word equations
is in PSPACE (Plandowski 1999) and the corresponding result for equations in
free groups with rational constraints (Diekert, Hagenah and Gutierrez 2001). As
a byproduct we obtain a direct proof that it is decidable in PSPACE whether or
not the solution set is finite.

Information Retrieval(CLIR)is the quality of translations being employed in
CLIR. In order to improve the quality of translations, it is important to
exploit available resources efficiently. Employing different translation
resources with different characteristics has many challenges. In this paper, we
propose a method for exploiting available translation resources simultaneously.
This method employs Learning to Rank(LTR) for exploiting different translation
resources. To apply LTR methods for query translation, we define different
translation relation based features in addition to context based features. We
use the contextual information contained in translation resources for
extracting context based features.The proposed method uses LTR to construct a
translation ranking model based on defined features. The constructed model is
used for ranking translation candidates of query words. To evaluate the
proposed method we do English-Persian CLIR, in which we employ the translation
ranking model to find translations of English queries and employ the
translations to retrieve Persian documents. Experimental results show that our
approach significantly outperforms single resource based CLIR methods.

topological, differential and conformal structure of the spacetime in the
optimal chronological diamond type set containing the world line. In the case
when the unknown part of the spacetime is vacuum, we can also determine the
metric itself. We exploit the non-linearity of the equation to obtain a rich
set of propagating singularities, produced by a non-linear interaction of
singularities that propagate initially as for linear wave equations. This
non-linear effect is then used as a tool to solve the inverse problem for the
non-linear system. The method works even in cases where the corresponding
inverse problems for linear equations remain open, and it can potentially be
applied to a large class of inverse problems for non-linear hyperbolic
equations encountered in practical imaging problems.
