of Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature on M. A long-standing
question is: when is this space non-empty (i.e. when does M admit a metric of
positive scalar curvature)? More generally: what is the topology of this space?
For example, what are its homotopy groups?
  Higher index theory of the Dirac operator is the basic tool to address these
questions. This has seen tremendous development in recent years, and in this
survey we will discuss some of the most pertinent examples.
  In particular, we will show how advancements of large scale index theory
(also called coarse index theory) give rise to new types of obstructions, and
provide the tools for a systematic study of the existence and classification
problem via the K-theory of C*-algebras. This is part of a program ""mapping the
topology of positive scalar curvature to analysis"".
  In addition, we will show how advanced surgery theory and smoothing theory
can be used to construct the first elements of infinite order in the k-th
homotopy groups of the space of metrics of positive scalar curvature for
arbitrarily large k. Moreover, these examples are the first ones which remain
non-trivial in the moduli space of such metrics.

order to probe the bulk response of vortex matter, particularly at
high-temperatures where surface barriers for vortex entrance dominate. From the
$T_{\rm FOT}$-evolution of the enthalpy and latent-heat at the transition we
find that, contrary to previous reports, the nature of the dominant interlayer
coupling is electromagnetic in the whole temperature range. By studying the
dynamic properties of the phase located at $T \gtrsim T_{\rm FOT}$, we reveal
the spanning in a considerable fraction of the phase diagram of a non-linear

the measurement of translational motion by taking the difference of the

the difference between the diagonal quadrants. The latter measurement
eliminates the translational component entirely, and leads to a detection

temperature, the residual resistance and various superconductor parameters,
e.g. the energy gap, and the electron mean free path. These parameters can be
determined by measuring the quality factor Q0 of a SRF cavity in helium-baths
of different temperatures. The surface resistance can be computed from Q0 for
any cavity geometry, but it is not trivial to determine the temperature of the
surface when only the temperature of the helium bath is known.
  Traditionally, it was approximated that the surface temperature on the inner
surface of the cavity was the same as the temperature of the helium bath. This
is a good approximation at small RF-fields on the surface, but to determine the
field dependence of Rs, one cannot be restricted to small field losses.
  Here we show the following: (1) How computer simulations can be used to
determine the inside temperature Tin so that Rs(Tin) can then be used to
extract the superconducting parameters. The computer code combines the
well-known programs, the HEAT code and the SRIMP code. (2) How large an error
is created when assuming the surface temperature is same as the temperature of
the helium bath? It turns out that this error is at least 10% at high RF-fields
in typical cases.

ratio of the GUP corrected energy of the particle to the GUP corrected Hawking

This result is then exploited to compute the Hawking temperature for more

Choosing the coefficients of the terms in the series in a specific way enables
one to sum the infinite series exactly. This leads to a Hawking temperature for
the Schwarzschild black hole that agrees with the result which accounts for the

critical binary mixture near the consolute point, exhibit attraction. The
numerical method for computation of the interaction potential between two
spherical particles using Monte Carlo simulations for the Ising model is
proposed. This method is based on the integration of the local magnetization
over the applied local magnetic field. For the stronger interaction the
concentration of the component of the mixture that does not wet colloidal
particles, should be larger, than the critical concentration. The strongest
amplitude of the interactions is observed below the critical point.

Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are particularly
attractive because of high detection efficiency, sub-50-ps timing jitter,
nanosecond-scale reset time, and sensitivity from the visible to the
mid-infrared spectrum. However, while single SNSPDs have been incorporated into
individual waveguides, the system efficiency of multiple SNSPDs in one photonic

a micrometer-scale flip-chip process that enables scalable integration of

current deep in the Mott-insulator state as one may expect. Other observable
quantities used to characterize the quasi-steady state in the bulk of the

latter in particular provides a striking signature of the superfluid-Mott

the hard-wall confining potentials. We provide results for the height and the
speed of the shock front that propagates from the boundary toward the center of

allow relating the sizes of terms and subterms occurring at different argument

can infer both lower and upper bounds on the resources used by all the

equations for inferring both size and resource usage functions. We show that
the analysis is an improvement over the previous resource analysis present in

ArgoNeuT detector in the Main Injector neutrino beam at Fermilab has recorded a
sample of 30 fully reconstructed charged current events where the leading muon
is accompanied by a pair of protons at the interaction vertex, 19 of which have
both protons above the Fermi momentum of the Ar nucleus. Out of these 19
events, four are found with the two protons in a strictly back-to-back high
momenta configuration directly observed in the final state and can be
associated to nucleon Resonance pionless mechanisms involving a pre-existing
short range correlated np pair in the nucleus. Another fraction (four events)
of the remaining 15 events have a reconstructed back-to-back configuration of a
np pair in the initial state, a signature compatible with one-body Quasi
Elastic interaction on a neutron in a SRC pair. The detection of these two
subsamples of the collected (mu- + 2p) events suggests that mechanisms directly
involving nucleon-nucleon SRC pairs in the nucleus are active and can be
efficiently explored in neutrino-argon interactions with the LAr TPC

estimation. Heaped data may be collected cross-sectionally or longitudinally

well-known issue in many survey settings, and inference for heaped data is an
important statistical problem. We propose a novel reporting distribution whose
underlying parameters are readily interpretable as rates of misremembering and
rounding. The process accommodates a variety of heaping grids and allows for
quasi-heaping to values nearly but not equal to heaping multiples. We present a
Bayesian hierarchical model for longitudinal samples with covariates to infer
both the unobserved true distribution of counts and the parameters that control

energy consumption of access networks. This paper focuses on reducing energy
consumption of Ethernet passive optical network (EPON) as one of the most
efficient transmission technologies for broadband access. In EPON, the
downstream traffic is sent from the optical line terminal (OLT) located at the
central office to all optical network units (ONUs). Each ONU checks all arrival
downstream packets and selects the downstream packets destined to itself.
Therefore, receivers at ONUs have to always stay awake, thus consuming a large
amount of energy. Contrariwise, an ONU transmitter can be triggered by the
arrival of the upstream traffic and so it can go to the low power mode when no
traffic is observed. Putting ONUs into the low power mode during light traffic
is a known strategy for energy saving. In this article, we address the
downstream challenge and also improve the ONU transmitter sleep time by
proposing a simple sleep control scheme. We also propose an upstream and a
downstream sleep-aware traffic scheduling scheme to avoid missing the packets
during the sleep states. The proposed sleep control scheme does not need the
handshake process and is based on the mutual inference at OLT and ONU.
Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can save energy as much as 60%
when the network traffic is light.

generation, high extraction efficiency, directional and coherent emission, as
well as position control at the nanoscale is required for implementing
ambitious schemes in quantum information processing, such as that of a quantum
repeater. Still, all of these properties have not yet been achieved in a single
device. Semiconductor quantum dots embedded in nanowire waveguides potentially
satisfy all of these requirements; however, although theoretically predicted,
entanglement has not yet been demonstrated for a nanowire quantum dot. Here, we
demonstrate a bright and coherent source of strongly entangled photon pairs
from a position controlled nanowire quantum dot with a fidelity as high as
0.859 +/- 0.006 and concurrence of 0.80 +/- 0.02. The two-photon quantum state
is modified via the nanowire shape. Our new nanoscale entangled photon source
can be integrated at desired positions in a quantum photonic circuit, single
electron devices and light emitting diodes.

for the task of measuring weak-lensing shapes, and 2) utilize DECam's large
field of view to map out the clusters and their environments over 90 arcmin. We
conduct a series of rigorous tests on astrometry, photometry, image quality,
PSF modeling, and shear measurement accuracy to single out flaws in the data
and also to identify the optimal data processing steps and parameters. We find
Science Verification data from DECam to be suitable for the lensing analysis
described in this paper. The PSF is generally well-behaved, but the modeling is
rendered difficult by a flux-dependent PSF width and ellipticity. We employ
photometric redshifts to distinguish between foreground and background
galaxies, and a red-sequence cluster finder to provide cluster richness
estimates and cluster-galaxy distributions. By fitting NFW profiles to the
clusters in this study, we determine weak-lensing masses that are in agreement
with previous work. For Abell 3261, we provide the first estimates of redshift,
weak-lensing mass, and richness. In addition, the cluster-galaxy distributions
indicate the presence of filamentary structures attached to 1E 0657-56 and RXC
J2248.7-4431, stretching out as far as 1 degree (approximately 20 Mpc),

posterior distribution now tends to favor smaller values of Msusy than in the
previous analyses. As a consequence, the statistical weight of the A-resonance
region increases to about 30% of the total probability, with interesting new
prospects for the 14 TeV run at the LHC. The most favored region, on the other
hand, still features multi-TeV squarks and gluinos, and ~1TeV higgsino dark
matter whose detection prospects by current and one-tonne detectors look very
promising. The same region is predominant in the NUHM, although the A-resonance

  We investigate the rate of confusion between objects classified as contact
binaries and type-c RR Lyrae (RRc's) based on periods, colours, amplitudes,
metalicities, radial velocities and surface gravities. We find that no more
than few percent of these variables in these classes are misidentified. By
deriving distances for this clean sample of ~5,500 RRc's, we trace the path of
the Sagittarius tidal streams within the Galactic halo. Selecting 146
outer-halo RRc's with SDSS radial velocities, we confirm the presence of a
coherent halo structure that is inconsistent with current N-body simulations of
the Sagittarius tidal stream. We also find numerous long-period variables that
are very likely associated within the Sagittarius tidal streams system.

evidence for two subgroups exhibiting irregular lightcurves. One subgroup

jet shapes in proton-proton collisions have served as precision tests of
perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). They have also recently become the
baseline for studying the in-medium modification of parton showers in
ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. The jet shape is a function of
two angular parameters $R$ and $r$, which can be at hierarchical scales. Its
calculation suffers from large logarithms of the ratio between the two scales,
and these phase space logarithms can conveniently be resummed in the framework
of soft-collinear effective theory (SCET). We find that, up to power
corrections, the integral jet shape can be expressed in a factorized form which
involves only the ratio between two jet energy functions. Resummation is
performed at next-to-leading logarithmic order using renormalization-group
evolution techniques. Comparisons to jet shape measurements at the LHC are

be in agreement with the Standard Model (SM). We show that even if the
inclusive Higgs production rate is very SM-like, a precise determination of the
boosted Higgs transverse momentum shape offers the opportunity to see effects
of natural new physics. These measurements are generically motivated by
effective field theory arguments and specifically in extensions of the SM with
a natural weak scale, like composite Higgs models and natural supersymmetry. We
show in detail how a measurement at high transverse momentum of $H\to
2\ell+\mathbf{p}\!\!/_T$ via $H\to \tau\tau$ and $H\to WW^*$ could be performed
and demonstrate that it offers a compelling alternative to the $t\bar t H$

scenario of an exactly SM-like inclusive Higgs cross-section.

we propose that this state can be realized in doped Weyl semimetals or Weyl

required ingredient for such a topological superconductor. By applying the
fluctuation-exchange approach to a generic model of time-reversal invariant

function between Fermi surfaces with opposite Chern numbers. We find that if
the normal state is inversion symmetric, onsite repulsive and exchange
interactions induce various nodal phases as well as a small region of
topological superconductivity on the phase diagram. Unlike the He$^{3}$B
topological superconductor, the phase here does not rely on any special
momentum dependence of the pairing amplitude. Breaking inversion symmetry
precludes some of the nodal phases and the topological superconductor becomes
much more prominent, especially at large ferromagnetic interaction. Our
approach can be extended to generic Dirac or Weyl metals.

Running efficient urban policies requires meaningful urban metrics, which could
quantify important urban characteristics including various aspects of an actual
human behavior. Since a city size is known to have a major, yet often
nonlinear, impact on the human activity, it also becomes important to develop
scale-free metrics that capture qualitative city properties, beyond the effects
of scale. Recent availability of extensive datasets created by human activity
involving digital technologies creates new opportunities in this area. In this
paper we propose a novel approach of city scoring and classification based on
quantitative scale-free metrics related to economic activity of city residents,
as well as domestic and foreign visitors. It is demonstrated on the example of
Spain, but the proposed methodology is of a general character. We employ a new
source of large-scale ubiquitous data, which consists of anonymized countrywide
records of bank card transactions collected by one of the largest Spanish
banks. Different aspects of the classification reveal important properties of
Spanish cities, which significantly complement the pattern that might be
discovered with the official socioeconomic statistics.

plasma-electron periods and few plasma-ion periods, much less than a
recombination time. The evolution and relaxation of such a wakefield-perturbed
plasma over these timescales has important implications for the upper limits of
repetition-rates in plasma colliders. Intense fields in relativistic lasers (or
intense beams) create plasma wakefields (modes around {\omega}pe) by
transferring energy to the plasma electrons. Charged-particle beams in the
right phase may be accelerated with acceleration/focusing gradients of tens of
GeV/m. However, wakefields leave behind a plasma not in equilibrium, with a
relaxation time of multiple plasma-electron periods. Ion motion over ion
timescales, caused by energy transfer from the driven plasma-electrons to the
plasma-ions can create interesting plasma states. Eventually during LTE, the
dynamics of plasma de-coheres (multiple modes through instability driven
mixing), thermalizing into random motion (second law of thermodynamics),
dissipating energy away from the wakefields. Wakefield-drivers interacting with
such a relativistically hot-plasma lead to plasma wakefields that differ from
the wakefields in a cold-plasma.

typically result from survey work, requires automation. However, except for the
classical cases of slowly rotating late-type spectra, existing methods of
measuring Doppler shifts require fine-tuning to avoid a loss of accuracy due to
the idiosyncrasies of individual spectra. The radial velocity spectrometer
(RVS) on the Gaia mission, which will start operating very soon, prompted a new
attempt at creating a measurement pipeline to handle a wide variety of spectral
types.
  The present paper describes the theoretical background on which this software
is based. However, apart from the assumption that only synthetic templates are
used, we do not rely on any of the characteristics of this instrument, so our
results should be relevant for most telescope-detector combinations.
  We propose an approach based on the simultaneous use of several alternative
measurement methods, each having its own merits and drawbacks, and conveying
the spectral information in a different way, leading to different values for
the measurement. A comparison or a combination of the various results either
leads to a ""best estimate"" or indicates to the user that the observed spectrum
is problematic and should be analysed manually.
  We selected three methods and analysed the relationships and differences
between them from a unified point of view; with each method an appropriate
estimator for the individual random error is chosen. We also develop a
procedure for tackling the problem of template mismatch in a systematic way.
Furthermore, we propose several tests for studying and comparing the
performance of the various methods as a function of the atmospheric parameters
of the observed objects. Finally, we describe a procedure for obtaining a
knowledge-based combination of the various Doppler-shift measurements.

broad Ly\alpha\ and O VI absorptions. A reanalysis of a few of this new class
of absorbers using slightly relaxed fitting criteria finds as many as 20 warm

redshift survey has been conducted around these sight lines to investigate the

cluster outskirts with radial velocity dispersions of \sigma\ = 250-750 km/s.
While 2\sigma\ evidence is presented favoring the hypothesis that these

nearest galaxies, this evidence has considerable systematic uncertainties and
is based on a small sample size so it is not entirely conclusive. If the
associations are with galaxy groups, the observed frequency of warm absorbers

cause observation uncertainties, this remains a very challenging task. In this
paper, we propose a novel, two-tiered coarse-to-fine (CTF) classification
cascade framework to tackle this problem. We first obtain
classification-critical data samples (e.g., samples on the decision boundary)
extracted from the holistic data distributions using a robust parametric model
(e.g., \cite{Raykar08}); then we build a graph-embedding based nonparametric
classifier on sampled data, which can more accurately preserve or formulate the
complex classification boundary. These two steps can also be considered as
effective ""sample pruning"" and ""feature pursuing + $k$NN/template matching"",
respectively. Our approach is validated comprehensively in colorectal polyp

using hospital scale, multi-site clinical datasets. The results show that our

(e.g., the LV equation studied) is the infinite population limit. Invariant
density for the stochastic dynamics plays a central role in the deterministic
LV dynamics. We show how the conservation law along a single trajectory extends
to incorporate both variations in a model parameter $\alpha$ and in initial
conditions: Helmholtz's theorem establishes a broadly valid conservation law in
a class of ecological dynamics. We analyze the relationships among mean
ecological activeness $\theta$, quantities characterizing dynamic ranges of
populations $\mathcal{A}$ and $\alpha$, and the ecological force $F_{\alpha}$.
The analyses identify an entire orbit as a stationary ecology, and establish
the notion of ""equation of ecological states"". Studies of the stochastic
dynamics with finite populations show the LV equation as the robust, fast
cyclic underlying behavior. The mathematical narrative provides a novel way of
capturing long-term dynamical behaviors with an emergent {\em conservative
ecology}.

the SUSY breaking scale in the hidden sector (\sqrt f) to few TeV, which we

of {\it extended mode projection} to control the impact of spatially-varying
systematics in a robust fashion, making use of blind analysis techniques. This
allows the accurate measurement of quasar halo bias at the largest scales,
while discarding as little as possible of the data. The standard local-type PNG
parameters $f_\mathrm{NL}$ and $g_\mathrm{NL}$ both imprint a $k^{-2}$
scale-dependent effect in the bias. Constraining these individually, we obtain
$-49<f_\mathrm{NL}<31$ and $-2.7\times10^5<g_\mathrm{NL}<1.9\times10^5$, while
their joint constraints lead to $-105<f_\mathrm{NL}<72$ and

obtained to date on PNG using a single population of large-scale structure

phase created from the interface between the initial and nucleated final

competition between the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions, leads
to suppression of the dynamic aspect of the transition, generating a static

size of the extended domain to the physical domain) and the oversampling ratio

problem, in part because SASO principles are not yet well understood and few
platforms exist for exploring them. Cellular automata (CA) are a well-studied
approach to exploring the principles underlying self-organization. A CA
comprises a lattice of cells whose states change over time based on a discrete
update function. One challenge to developing CA is that the relationship of an
update function, which describes the local behavior of each cell, to the global
behavior of the entire CA is often unclear. As a result, many researchers have
used stochastic search techniques, such as evolutionary algorithms, to
automatically discover update functions that produce a desired global behavior.
However, these update functions are typically defined in a way that does not
provide for self-adaptation. Here we describe an approach to discovering CA
update functions that are both self-adaptive and self-organizing. Specifically,
we use a novel evolutionary algorithm-based approach to discover finite state
machines (FSMs) that implement update functions for CA. We show how this
approach is able to evolve FSM-based update functions that perform well on the
density classification task for 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional CA. Moreover, we show
that these FSMs are self-adaptive, self-organizing, and highly scalable, often
performing well on CA that are orders of magnitude larger than those used to
evaluate performance during the evolutionary search. These results demonstrate
that CA are a viable platform for studying the integration of self-adaptation
and self-organization, and strengthen the case for using evolutionary
algorithms as a component of SASO systems.

flexible framework for modeling asymmetry and heavy tails, which is useful when
modeling financial returns. An issue with this distributional assumption is the
lack of a closed form for the probability density function. To estimate the
volatility of financial returns in this setting, we develop a novel auxiliary
particle filter. The algorithm we develop can be easily applied to any hidden
Markov model for which the likelihood function is intractable or
computationally expensive. The approximate target distribution of our auxiliary
filter is based on the idea of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). ABC
methods allow for inference on posterior quantities in situations when the
likelihood of the underlying model is not available in closed form, but
simulating samples from it is possible. The ABC auxiliary particle filter
(ABC-APF) that we propose provides not only a good alternative to state
estimation in stochastic volatility models, but it also improves on the
existing ABC literature. It allows for more flexibility in state estimation
while improving on the accuracy through better proposal distributions in cases
when the optimal importance density of the filter is unavailable in closed
form. We assess the performance of the ABC-APF on a simulated dataset from the

for such signals can be defined using the spectrum of the graph Laplacian
matrix. The sampling theory for graph signals aims to extend the traditional
Nyquist-Shannon sampling theory by allowing us to identify the class of graph
signals that can be reconstructed from their values on a subset of vertices.
This approach allows us to define a criterion for active learning based on

provided the fastest detection to date among seven submillimeter afterglows at
230 GHz. The prompt spectral analysis, using Swift and Suzaku yielded a
spectral peak energy of $E^{\rm src}_{\rm peak}=107.8^{+15.3}_{-15.3}$ keV and
equivalent isotropic energy of $E_{\rm iso}$ as $3.18^{+0.40}_{-0.32}\times

were consistent with the standard forward shock synchrotron with jet
collimation ($6^{\circ}.69\pm0^{\circ}.16$). The forward shock modeling using a
2D relativistic hydrodynamic jet simulation also determined the reasonable
burst explosion and the synchrotron radiation parameters for the optical
afterglow. The X-ray light curve showed no apparent jet break and the temporal
decay index relation between the X-ray and optical ($\alpha{\rm

reverse shock is a possible solution, and the detection and the slow decay of
the afterglow in submillimeter supports that this is a plausible idea. The
observed temporal evolution and spectral properties as well as forward shock
modeling parameters, enabled to determine reasonable functions to describe the
afterglow properties. Because half of events share similar properties in the

  Flow","10 pages",,,,"cs.SI cs.CY cs.IT math.IT physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Real-world networks are often organized as modules or communities of similar
nodes that serve as functional units. These networks are also rich in content,
with nodes having distinguishing features or attributes. In order to discover a
network's modular structure, it is necessary to take into account not only its
links but also node attributes. We describe an information-theoretic method
that identifies modules by compressing descriptions of information flow on a
network. Our formulation introduces node content into the description of
information flow, which we then minimize to discover groups of nodes with
similar attributes that also tend to trap the flow of information. The method
has several advantages: it is conceptually simple and does not require ad-hoc
parameters to specify the number of modules or to control the relative
contribution of links and node attributes to network structure. We apply the
proposed method to partition real-world networks with known community
structure. We demonstrate that adding node attributes helps recover the
underlying community structure in content-rich networks more effectively than
using links alone. In addition, we show that our method is faster and more
accurate than alternative state-of-the-art algorithms.

through defect engineering and oxygen bonding. Micro- PL and Raman images
clearly reveal that the PL enhancement occurs at cracks/defects formed during
high temperature vacuum annealing. The PL enhancement at crack/defect sites
could be as high as thousands of times after considering the laser spot size.
The main reasons of such huge PL enhancement include: (1) the oxygen chemical
adsorption induced heavy p doping and the conversion from trion to exciton; (2)
the suppression of non-radiative recombination of excitons at defect sites as
verified by low temperature PL measurements. First principle calculations
reveal a strong binding energy of ~2.395 eV for oxygen molecule adsorbed on an
S vacancy of MoS2. The chemical adsorbed oxygen also provides a much more
effective charge transfer (0.997 electrons per O2) compared to physical
adsorbed oxygen on ideal MoS2 surface. We also demonstrate that the defect
engineering and oxygen bonding could be easily realized by oxygen plasma
irradiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy further confirms the formation of
Mo-O bonding. Our results provide a new route for modulating the optical
properties of two dimensional semiconductors. The strong and stable PL from

carrier-carrier scattering can be stronger than the Drude absorption due to the
carrier scattering on disorder. Since the intraband absorption of radiation
effectively competes with its interband amplification, this can substantially
affect the conditions of the negative dynamic conductivity in the pumped
graphene and, hence, the interband terahertz and infrared lasing. We find the
threshold values of the frequency and quasi-Fermi energy of nonequilibrium
carriers corresponding to the onset of negative dynamic conductivity. The
obtained results show that the effect of carrier-carrier scattering shifts the
threshold frequency of the radiation amplification in pumped graphene to higher
values. In particular, the negative dynamic conductivity is attainable at the
frequencies above 6 THz in graphene on SiO2 substrates at room temperature. The
threshold frequency can be decreased to markedly lower values in graphene
structures with high-k substrates due to screening of the carrier-carrier
scattering, particularly at lower temperatures.

constraints of any fabrication process, the resulting optimal gaps are only
slightly larger than previous hand designs, suggesting that current photonic
crystals are nearly optimal in this respect. However, optimization can discover
new structures, e.g. a new fcc structure with the same symmetry but slightly
larger gap than the well known inverse opal, which may offer new degrees of
freedom to future fabrication technologies. Furthermore, our band-gap
optimization is an illustration of a computational approach to 3D dispersion
engineering which is applicable to many other problems in optics, based on a
novel semidefinite-program formulation for nonconvex eigenvalue optimization
combined with other techniques such as a simple approach to impose symmetry
constraints. We also demonstrate a technique for \emph{robust} topology
optimization, in which some uncertainty is included in each voxel and we
optimize the worst-case gap, and we show that the resulting band gaps have
increased robustness to systematic fabrication errors.

$\ell^\infty(G)$ that arises as the image of a unital positive G-equivariant
projection. This algebra always exists and is unique up to isomorphism. It is
trivial if and only if G is amenable. We prove that, more generally, it can be
identified with the algebra $C(\partial_F G)$ of continuous functions on
Furstenberg's universal G-boundary $\partial_F G$.
  This operator-algebraic construction of the Furstenberg boundary has a number
of interesting consequences. We prove that G is exact precisely when the
G-action on $\partial_F G$ is amenable, and use this fact to prove Ozawa's
conjecture that if G is exact, then there is an embedding of the reduced
C*-algebra $\mathrm{C}_r^*(G)$ of G into a nuclear C*-algebra which is
contained in the injective envelope of $\mathrm{C}_r^*(G)$.
  It is a longstanding open problem to determine which groups are C*-simple, in
the sense that the algebra $\mathrm{C}_r^*(G)$ is simple. We prove that this
problem can be reformulated as a problem about the structure of the G-action on
the Furstenberg boundary. Specifically, we prove that a discrete group G is
C*-simple if and only if the G-action on the Furstenberg boundary is
topologically free. We apply this result to prove that Tarski monster groups
are C*-simple. This provides another solution to a problem of de la Harpe

and military applications. This paper determines the localization accuracy of
an agent, which is equipped with an antenna array and localizes itself using
wireless measurements with anchor nodes, in a far-field environment. In view of
the Cram\'er-Rao bound, we first derive the localization information for static
scenarios and demonstrate that such information is a weighed sum of Fisher
information matrices from each anchor-antenna measurement pair. Each matrix can
be further decomposed into two parts: a distance part with intensity
proportional to the squared baseband effective bandwidth of the transmitted
signal and a direction part with intensity associated with the normalized
anchor-antenna visual angle. Moreover, in dynamic scenarios, we show that the
Doppler shift contributes additional direction information, with intensity
determined by the agent velocity and the root mean squared time duration of the
transmitted signal. In addition, two measures are proposed to evaluate the
localization performance of wireless networks with different anchor-agent and
array-antenna geometries, and both formulae and simulations are provided for
typical anchor deployments and antenna arrays.

A thin layer of In2O3 offers a higher carrier concentration, thereby maximizing
the charge accumulation and yielding high carrier mobility. A thick layer of
InZnO controls the charge conductance resulting in low off-state current and
suitable threshold voltage. As a consequence, the BMO TFT showed higher
filed-effect mobility (37.9 cm2/V s) than single-layer InZnO TFT (7.6 cm2/V s).
More importantly, an on/off current ratio of 109, a subthreshold swing voltage
of 120 mV/decade, as well as a threshold voltage shift (less than 0.4 V) under
bias stress for 2.5 hours were obtained simultaneously. These promising
properties are obtained at a low operation voltage of 3 V. This work
demonstrates that the BMO TFT has great potential applications as switching

makes repair transmissions prone to physical layer errors. The first approach
to combat fading is to utilize the existing optimal space-time codes. However,
it was recently pointed out that such codes are in general too complex to
decode when the number of helper nodes is bigger than the number of antennas at
the newcomer or data collector. In this paper, a novel protocol for wireless
storage transmissions based on algebraic space-time codes is presented in order
to improve the system reliability while enabling feasible decoding. The
diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT) of the system together with
sphere-decodability even with low number of antennas are used as the main

function $\phi$ on $\mathbb{H}^d$, for a convex set $K$ in Minkowski space with
$C^2$ space-like boundary $S$, such that $\phi(\eta)^{-1}$ is the
Gauss--Kronecker curvature at the point with normal $\eta$. Analogously to the
Euclidean case, it is possible to formulate a weak version of this problem:
given a Radon measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{H}^d$ the generalized Minkowski problem
in Minkowski space asks for a convex subset $K$ such that the area measure of
$K$ is $\mu$.
  In the present paper we look at an equivariant version of the problem: given
a uniform lattice $\Gamma$ of isometries of $\mathbb{H}^d$, given a $\Gamma$
invariant Radon measure $\mu$, given a isometry group $\Gamma_{\tau}$ of
Minkowski space, with $\Gamma$ as linear part, there exists a unique convex set
with area measure $\mu$, invariant under the action of $\Gamma_{\tau}$.
  The proof uses a functional which is the covolume associated to every
invariant convex set.
  This result translates as a solution of the Minkowski problem in flat space
times with compact hyperbolic Cauchy surface. The uniqueness part, as well as
regularity results, follow from properties of the Monge--Amp\`ere equation. The
existence part can be translated as an existence result for Monge--Amp\`ere
equation.
  The regular version was proved by T.~Barbot, F.~B\'eguin and A.~Zeghib for
$d=2$ and by V.~Oliker and U.~Simon for $\Gamma_{\tau}=\Gamma$. Our method is
totally different. Moreover, we show that those cases are very specific: in
general, there is no smooth $\Gamma_\tau$-invariant surface of constant
Gauss-Kronecker curvature equal to $1$.

The first assumes Gaussian fluctuations around a distribution that is fixed by
the collision geometry but leads to non-Gaussian features after averaging over
the reaction plane orientation at non-zero impact parameter. In this context,
we derive a three-parameter extension of the commonly used Bessel-Gaussian
event-by-event distribution of harmonic flow coefficients. Secondly, we study a
model of N independent point sources for which connected n-point correlation
functions of initial perturbations scale like 1/N^(n-1). This scaling is
violated for non-central collisions in a way that can be characterized by its
impact parameter dependence. We discuss to what extent these are generic
properties that can be expected to hold for any model of initial conditions,
and how this can improve the fluid dynamical analysis of heavy ion collisions.

  methods",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CE q-bio.QM stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Enzyme sequences and structures are routinely used in the biological sciences
as queries to search for functionally related enzymes in online databases. To
this end, one usually departs from some notion of similarity, comparing two
enzymes by looking for correspondences in their sequences, structures or
surfaces. For a given query, the search operation results in a ranking of the
enzymes in the database, from very similar to dissimilar enzymes, while
information about the biological function of annotated database enzymes is
ignored.
  In this work we show that rankings of that kind can be substantially improved
by applying kernel-based learning algorithms. This approach enables the
detection of statistical dependencies between similarities of the active cleft
and the biological function of annotated enzymes. This is in contrast to
search-based approaches, which do not take annotated training data into
account. Similarity measures based on the active cleft are known to outperform
sequence-based or structure-based measures under certain conditions. We
consider the Enzyme Commission (EC) classification hierarchy for obtaining
annotated enzymes during the training phase. The results of a set of sizeable
experiments indicate a consistent and significant improvement for a set of
similarity measures that exploit information about small cavities in the
surface of enzymes.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Small cell networks are regarded as a promising candidate to meet the
exponential growth of mobile data traffic in cellular networks. With a dense
deployment of access points, spatial reuse will be improved, and uniform
coverage can be provided. However, such performance gains cannot be achieved
without effective intercell interference management. In this paper, a novel
interference coordination strategy, called user-centric intercell interference
nulling, is proposed for small cell networks. A main merit of the proposed
strategy is its ability to effectively identify and mitigate the dominant
interference for each user. Different from existing works, each user selects
the coordinating base stations (BSs) based on the relative distance between the
home BS and the interfering BSs, called the interference nulling (IN) range,
and thus interference nulling adapts to each user's own interference situation.
By adopting a random spatial network model, we derive an approximate expression
of the successful transmission probability to the typical user, which is then
used to determine the optimal IN range. Simulation results shall confirm the
tightness of the approximation, and demonstrate significant performance gains
(about 35%-40%) of the proposed coordination strategy, compared with the
non-coordination case. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed strategy
outperforms other interference nulling methods. Finally, the effect of
imperfect channel state information (CSI) is investigated, where CSI is assumed
to be obtained via limited feedback. It is shown that the proposed coordination
strategy still provides significant performance gains even with a moderate
number of feedback bits.

is a finite representation of an infinite execution of the form $(\vec{x} +
\sum_{i=0}^t \lambda^i \vec{y})_{t \geq 0}$. The existence of this
nontermination argument can be stated as a set of nonlinear algebraic
constraints. We show that every linear loop program that has a bounded infinite
execution also has a geometric nontermination argument. Furthermore, we discuss
nonterminating programs that do not have a geometric nontermination argument.

  (2013), pp. 488-498",,,"cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motion estimation is one of the major problems in developing video coding
applications. Among all motion estimation approaches, Block matching (BM)
algorithms are the most popular methods due to their effectiveness and
simplicity for both software and hardware implementations. A BM approach
assumes that the movement of pixels within a defined region of the current
frame (Macro-Block, MB) can be modeled as a translation of pixels contained in
the previous frame. In this procedure, the motion vector is obtained by
minimizing the sum of absolute differences (SAD) produced by the MB of the
current frame over a determined search window from the previous frame. The SAD
evaluation is computationally expensive and represents the most consuming
operation in the BM process. The most straightforward BM method is the full
search algorithm (FSA) which finds the most accurate motion vector, calculating
exhaustively the SAD values for all elements of the search window. Over this
decade, several fast BM algorithms have been proposed to reduce the number of
SAD operations by calculating only a fixed subset of search locations at the
price of a poor accuracy. In this paper, a new algorithm based on Differential
Evolution (DE) is proposed to reduce the number of search locations in the BM
process. In order to avoid computing several search locations, the algorithm
estimates the SAD values (fitness) for some locations using the SAD values of
previously calculated neighboring positions. Since the proposed algorithm does
not consider any fixed search pattern or other different assumption, a high
probability for finding the true minimum (accurate motion vector) is expected.
In comparison to other fast BM algorithms, the proposed method deploys more
accurate motion vectors yet delivering competitive time rates.

  Grapevine Trunk Diameter in Outdoor Conditions","10 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Trunk diameter is a variable of agricultural interest, used mainly in the
prediction of fruit trees production. It is correlated with leaf area and
biomass of trees, and consequently gives a good estimate of the potential
production of the plants. This work presents a low cost, high precision method
for the measurement of trunk diameter of grapevines based on Computer Vision
techniques. Several methods based on Computer Vision and other techniques are
introduced in the literature. These methods present different advantages for
crop management: they are amenable to be operated by unknowledgeable personnel,
with lower operational costs; they result in lower stress levels to
knowledgeable personnel, avoiding the deterioration of the measurement quality
over time; and they make the measurement process amenable to be embedded in
larger autonomous systems, allowing more measurements to be taken with
equivalent costs. To date, all existing autonomous methods are either of low
precision, or have a prohibitive cost for massive agricultural adoption,
leaving the manual Vernier caliper or tape measure as the only choice in most
situations. In this work we present a semi-autonomous measurement method that
is susceptible to be fully automated, cost effective for mass adoption, and its
precision is competitive (with slight improvements) over the caliper manual
method.
