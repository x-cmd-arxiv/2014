between two elements $f_1,f_2\in\mathbb{B}$, one constructs a double complex of
$\mathbb{B}$-modules, ${\cal G}_\mathbb{B},$ called the small Gobelin. We
describe an inductive procedure to construct the even and odd hyperhomologies
of this complex. For high degrees, the difference $\dim \mathbb{H}_{j+2}({\cal
G}_\mathbb{B}) - \dim\mathbb{H}_j({\cal G}_\mathbb{B})$ is constant, but
possibly with a different value for even and odd degrees. We describe two flags
of ideals in $\mathbb{B}$ which codify the above differences of dimension. The
motivation to study this double complex comes from understanding the tangency
condition between a vector field and a complete intersection, and invariants
constructed in the zero locus of the vector field $\hbox{Spec}(\mathbb{B})$.

a compatible non-local correlation functional. The functional is by
construction free of one-electron self-interaction, respects constraints
derived from uniform coordinate scaling, and has the correct asymptotic
behavior of the xc energy density. It contains one parameter that is not
determined ab initio. We investigate whether it is possible to construct a
functional that yields accurate binding energies and affords other advantages,
specifically Kohn-Sham eigenvalues that reliably reflect ionization potentials.
Tests for a set of atoms and small molecules show that within our local-hybrid
form accurate binding energies can be achieved by proper optimization of the
free parameter in our functional, along with an improvement in dissociation
energy curves and in Kohn-Sham eigenvalues. However, the correspondence of the
latter to experimental ionization potentials is not yet satisfactory, and if we
choose to optimize their prediction, a rather different value of the

discussing similar observations for other functionals and possible directions
for further functional development that our findings suggest.

reproduce the correct value of the $\tau$ lepton semihadronic strangeless decay

that the photonic system equilibrates to the temperature of the bath, with a
tunable chemical potential that is set by the frequency of the parametric

metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy to study the feasibility of a single X-ray
diffraction (XRD) measurement for full composition determination of quaternary
layer material. The method is based on the peak intensity of a quasi-forbidden
(002) reflection which is shown to vary with changing arsenic content for
GaAsPN. The method works for thin films with a wide range of arsenic contents
and shows a clear variation in the reflection intensity as a function of
changing layer composition. The obtained thicknesses and compositions of the
grown layers are compared with accurate reference values obtained by Rutherford
backscattering spectroscopy combined with nuclear reaction analysis
measurements. Based on the comparison, the error in the XRD defined material
composition becomes larger with increasing nitrogen content and layer
thickness. This suggests that the dominating error source is the deteriorated
crystal quality due to the nonsubstitutional incorporation of nitrogen into the
crystal lattice and strain relaxation. The results reveal that the method
overestimates the arsenic and nitrogen content within error margins of about
0.12 and about 0.025, respectively.

the network graph may be erroneous, or derived from probabilistic techniques.
In such cases, the node classification problem can be challenging, since the
unreliability of the links may affect the final results of the classification
process. If the information about link reliability is not used explicitly, the
classification accuracy in the underlying network may be affected adversely. In
this paper, we focus on situations that require the analysis of the uncertainty
that is present in the graph structure. We study the novel problem of node
classification in uncertain graphs, by treating uncertainty as a first-class
citizen. We propose two techniques based on a Bayes model and automatic
parameter selection, and show that the incorporation of uncertainty in the
classification process as a first-class citizen is beneficial. We
experimentally evaluate the proposed approach using different real data sets,
and study the behavior of the algorithms under different conditions. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

introduce $Z_2$-odd right-handed neutrino superfields in addition to the

some of which are $Z_2$-odd. When the confinement scale is of the order of ten
TeV, electroweak phase transition can be sufficiently of first order, which is
required for successful electroweak baryogenesis. The lightest $Z_2$-odd
particle can be a new candidate for dark matter, in addition to the lightest
$R$-parity odd particle. Neutrino masses and mixings can be explained by the
quantum effects of $Z_2$-odd fields via the one-loop and three-loop diagrams.

galaxy formation is a complex process that combines these processes and others
in a non-linear way so that the origin of galaxy morphology remains to be fully

galaxies with a variety of morphology, but quite recent merger histories, to
identify which mechanisms are playing a major role. We analyse when minor
mergers can be considered relevant to determine galaxy morphology. We also
study the specific angular momentum content of the disc and central spheroidal
components separately. We used cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that
include an effective, physically motivated supernova feedback that is able to
regulate the star formation in haloes of different masses. We analysed the
morphology and formation history of a sample of 15 galaxies of a cosmological
simulation. We performed a spheroid-disc decomposition of the selected galaxies

systems as well as their relative masses were estimated to analyse the role
played by orientation and by minor mergers in the determination of the

momentum in accordance with the classical disc formation model. The specific
angular momentum of the stellar central spheroid correlates with the dark
matter halo angular momentum and determines a power law. Abridged

mobility, we introduce a path-dependent random walk model with long range
memory for which not only the mean square displacement (MSD) can be obtained
exactly in the asymptotic limit, but also the propagator. The model consists of
a random walker on a lattice, which, at a constant rate, stochastically
relocates at a site occupied at some earlier time. This time in the past is
chosen randomly according to a memory kernel, whose temporal decay can be
varied via an exponent parameter. In the weakly non-Markovian regime, memory
reduces the diffusion coefficient from the bare value. When the mean backward
jump in time diverges, the diffusion coefficient vanishes and a transition to
an anomalous subdiffusive regime occurs. Paradoxically, at the transition, the
process is an anti-correlated L\'evy flight. Although in the subdiffusive
regime the model exhibits some features of the continuous time random walk with
infinite mean waiting time, it belongs to another universality class. If memory
is very long-ranged, a second transition takes place to a regime characterized
by a logarithmic growth of the MSD with time. In this case the process is
asymptotically Gaussian and effectively described as a scaled Brownian motion
with a diffusion coefficient decaying as 1/t.

moderate to large over-abundances of carbon, but have no enhancements in their
neutron-capture elements. The most metal-poor star in the sample,
HE~0233$-$0343 ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]} = -4.68$), is a subgiant with a carbon
enhancement of $\mathrm{[C/Fe]}= +3.5$, slightly above the carbon-enhancement
plateau suggested by Spite et al. No carbon is detected in the spectrum of the
fourth star, but the quality of its spectrum only allows for the determination
of an upper limit on the carbon abundance ratio of $\mathrm{[C/Fe]} < +1.7$. We
detect lithium in the spectra of two of the carbon-enhanced stars, including
HE~0233$-$0343. Both stars with Li detections are Li-depleted, with respect to
the Li plateau for metal-poor dwarfs found by Spite \& Spite. This suggests
that whatever site(s) produced C either do not completely destroy lithium, or
that Li has been astrated by early-generation stars and mixed with primordial
Li in the gas that formed the stars observed at present. The derived abundances
for the $\alpha$-elements and iron-peak elements of the four stars are similar
to those found in previous large samples of extremely and ultra metal-poor
stars. Finally, a large spread is found in the abundances of Sr and Ba for
these stars, possibly influenced by enrichment from fast rotating stars in the
early universe.

stability and dynamics of cytoskeletal filaments. Molecular motors of the
kinesin-8 protein family depolymerise microtubules in a length-dependent
manner, and experimental and theoretical evidence suggest a role for kinesin-8
in the dynamic regulation of microtubules. However, so far the detailed
molecular mechanisms how these molecular motors interact with the growing
microtubule tip remain elusive. Here we investigate two interaction scenarios
for kinesin-8 and the microtubule tip. We give a comprehensive analysis of
regimes where length-regulation is possible and characterise how the stationary
length depends on the biochemical rates and the bulk concentrations of the
various proteins. For a neutral scenario, where microtubules grow irrespective
of whether the microtubule tip is occupied by a molecular motor, length
regulation is possible only for a narrow range of biochemical rates and limited
to small polymerisation rates. In contrast, for an inhibition scenario, where
the presence of a motor at the microtubule tip inhibits microtubule growth, the
regime of length regulation is extremely broad and includes high growth rates.
These results also apply to situations where polymerising enzymes, like
XMAP215, and kinesin-8 mutually exclude each other from the microtubule tip. We
also investigate the stochastic dynamics of the two scenarios. While for the
neutral scenario length is tightly controlled, length dynamics is intermittent
for the inhibition scenario and exhibits extended periods of microtubule growth
and shrinkage, reminiscent of microtubule dynamic instability. On a broader
perspective, the set of models established in this work quite generally
suggests that mutual exclusion of molecules at the ends of cytoskeletal
filaments is an important factor for filament dynamics and regulation.

Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT).
  BIT* uses a heuristic to efficiently search a series of increasingly dense

  We demonstrate the utility of BIT* on simulated random worlds in

gravity waves, and polarized dust. Planck dust polarization maps have
highlighted the difficulty of estimating the dust polarization in low intensity
regions, suggesting that the polarization fractions have considerable
uncertainties and may be significantly higher than previous predictions. In
this paper, we start by assuming nothing about the dust polarization except for
the power spectrum shape, which we take to be $C_{l}^{BB} \propto l^{-2.42}$.
The resulting joint BICEP2+Planck analysis favors solutions without gravity
waves, and the upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r<0.11$, a slight
improvement relative to the Planck analysis alone which gives $r<0.13$ (95%
c.l.). The estimated amplitude of the dust polarization power spectrum agrees
with expectations for this field based on both HI column density and Planck
polarization measurements at 353 GHz in the BICEP2 field. Including the latter
constraint in our analysis improves the limit further to $r < 0.09$, placing
strong constraints on inflation (e.g., models with $r>0.14$ are excluded with
99.5% confidence). We address the cross-correlation analysis of BICEP2 at 150
GHz with BICEP1 at 100 GHz as a test of foreground contamination. We find that
the null hypothesis of dust and lensing with $r=0$ gives $\Delta \chi^2<2$
relative to the hypothesis of no dust, so the frequency analysis does not
strongly favor either model over the other. We also discuss how more accurate
dust polarization maps may improve our constraints. If the dust polarization is
measured perfectly, the limit can reach $r<0.05$, but this degrades quickly to
almost no improvement if the dust calibration error is 20% or larger or if the
dust maps are not processed through the BICEP2 pipeline, inducing sampling
variance noise. (Abridged.)

A subset of BF categories -- closed BF categories -- classify topological

based on tensor network to realize those topological orders. (3) Bosonic
topological orders have an important topological invariant: the vector bundles
of the degenerate ground states over the moduli spaces of closed spaces with
different metrics. They may fully characterize topological orders. (4) We
conjecture that a topological order has a gappable boundary iff the above
mentioned vector bundles are flat. (5) We find a holographic phenomenon that
every topological order with a gappable boundary can be uniquely determined by
the knowledge of the boundary. As a consequence, BF categories in different
dimensions form a (monoid) cochain complex, that reveals the structure and
relation of topological orders and gravitational anomalies in different

that have no non-trivial topological excitations. We find that this kind of

capacity. The main driver for this development is wireless video. Traditional
methods for capacity increase (like using more spectrum and increasing base
station density) are very costly, and do not exploit the unique features of
video, in particular a high degree of {\em asynchronous content reuse}. In this
paper we give an overview of our work that proposed and detailed a new
transmission paradigm exploiting content reuse, and the fact that storage is
the fastest-increasing quantity in modern hardware. Our network structure uses
caching in helper stations (femto-caching) and/or devices, combined with highly
spectrally efficient short-range communications to deliver video files. For
femto-caching, we develop optimum storage schemes and dynamic streaming
policies that optimize video quality. For caching on devices, combined with
device-to-device communications, we show that communications within {\em
clusters} of mobile stations should be used; the cluster size can be adjusted
to optimize the tradeoff between frequency reuse and the probability that a
device finds a desired file cached by another device in the same cluster. We
show that in many situations the network throughput increases linearly with the
number of users, and that D2D communications also is superior in providing a
better tradeoff between throughput and outage than traditional base-station
centric systems. Simulation results with realistic numbers of users and channel
conditions show that network throughput (possibly with outage constraints) can
be increased by two orders of magnitude compared to conventional schemes.

potential to form galactic spiral shocks. While numerical simulations typically
show that spiral shocks are unstable to wiggle instability (WI) even in the
absence of magnetic fields and self-gravity, its physical nature has remained
uncertain. To clarify the mechanism behind the WI, we conduct a normal-mode
linear stability analysis as well as nonlinear simulations assuming that the
disk is isothermal and infinitesimally thin. We find that the WI is physical,
originating from the generation of potential vorticity at a deformed shock
front, rather than Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities as previously thought. Since
gas in galaxy rotation periodically passes through the shocks multiple times,
the potential vorticity can accumulate successively, setting up a normal mode
that grows exponentially with time. Eigenfunctions of the WI decay
exponentially downstream from the shock front. Both shock compression of
acoustic waves and a discontinuity of shear across the shock stabilize the WI.
The wavelength and growth time of the WI depend on the arm strength quite
sensitively. When the stellar-arm forcing is moderate at 5%, the wavelength of
the most unstable mode is about 0.07 times the arm-to-arm spacing, with the
growth rate comparable to the orbital angular frequency, which is found to be
in good agreement with the results of numerical simulations.

At the low-mass end, inconsistencies exist in previous works that still need to
be resolved, but our work is more in line with expectations based on modeling
of SMBH evolution. This low-mass end of the spectrum is critical to our
understanding of the mass function and evolution of SMBHs since the epoch of
maximum quasar activity. A luminosity distance $\leq$ 25.4 $Mpc$ and an
absolute B-band magnitude $\leq$ -19.12 define the sample. These limits define
a sample of 140 spiral galaxies, with 128 measurable pitch angles to establish
the pitch angle distribution for this sample. This pitch angle distribution
function may be useful in the study of the morphology of late-type galaxies. We
then use an established relationship between the pitch angle and the mass of
the central SMBH in a host galaxy in order to estimate the mass of the 128
respective SMBHs in this sample. This result effectively gives us the
distribution of mass for SMBHs residing in spiral galaxies over a lookback time

Nuclei (AGNs) at $z\sim1.5-3.5$, powered by some of the most massive black
holes (BHs), are constrained. The analysis is based on accretion disk (AD)
models, which link the continuum luminosity at rest-frame optical wavelengths
and the black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) to the accretion rate through the AD,
$\dot{M}_{\rm AD}$. The data are gathered from several literature samples with
detailed measurements of the ${\rm H}\beta$ emission line complex, observed at
near-IR bands. When coupled with standard estimates of bolometric luminosities
($L_{\rm bol}$), the analysis suggests high radiative efficiencies, with most
of the sources showing $\eta>0.2$ - that is, higher than the commonly assumed
value of 0.1, and the expected value for non-spinning BHs ($\eta=0.057$). Even
under more conservative assumptions regarding $L_{\rm bol}$ (i.e., $L_{\rm
bol}=3\times \lambda L_{\lambda}$[5100$\AA$]), most of the extremely massive
BHs in the sample (i.e., $M_{\rm BH} > 3\times10^9\,M_{\rm \odot}$) show
radiative efficiencies which correspond to very high BH spins ($a_{\rm *}$),
with typical values well above $a_{\rm *}\simeq0.7$. These results stand in
contrast to the predictions of a ""spin-down""scenario, in which a series of
randomly-oriented accretion episodes lead to $a_{\rm *}\simeq0$. Instead, the
analysis presented here strongly supports a ""spin-up"" scenario, which is driven
by either prolonged accretion or a series of anisotropically-oriented accretion
episodes. Considering the fact that these extreme BHs require long-duration
continuous accretion to account for their high masses, it is argued that the
most probable scenario for the SMBHs under study is that of an almost
continuous sequence of randomly- yet not isotropically-oriented accretion
episodes.

Swift bursts which are most likely non-Collapsars. We find that these sGRBs are
delayed relative to the global star formation rate (SFR) with a typical delay
time of a 3-4 Gyr (depending on the SFR model). However, if two or three sGRB
at high redshifts have been missed because of selection effects, a distribution
of delay times of ~1/t would be also compatible. The current event rate of
these non-Collapsar sGRBs with L_iso > 5*10^49 erg/s is 4.1(-1.9,+2.3)Gpc^-3
yr^-1. The rate was significantly larger around z ~ 1 and it declines since
that time. The luminosity function we find is a broken power law with a break
at 2.0(-0.4,+1.4) * 10^52~erg/s and power-law indices 0.95(-0.12,+0.12) and
2.0(-0.8,+1.0). When considering the whole Swift sGRB sample we find that it is
composed of two populations: One group (~ 60%-80% of Swift sGRBs) with the
above rate and time delay and a second group (~ 20%-40% of Swift sGRBs) of
potential ""impostors"" that follow the SFR with no delay. These two populations
are in very good agreement with the division of sGRBs to non-Collapsars and
Collapsars suggested recently by Bromberg2013. If non-Collapsar sGRBs arise
from neutron star merger this rate suggest a detection rate of 3-100 yr^-1 by a
future gravitational wave detectors (e.g. Advanced Ligo/Virgo with detection
horizon on 300 Mpc), and a co-detection with Fermi (Swift) rate of 0.1-1 yr^-1
(0.02-0.14 yr^-1). We estimate that about 4 * 10^5 (f_b^-1 / 30) mergers took
place in the Milky Way. If $0.025 m_\odot$ were ejected in each event this
would have been sufficient to produce all the heavy r-process material in the

inspection. The cluster luminosity functions in all four filters can be
approximated by power-laws with indices of $-1.7$ to $-2.3$. Some deviations
from pure power-law shape are observed, hinting at the presence of a high-mass
truncation in the cluster mass function. However, upon inspection of the

$-2.2\pm0.2$ despite a slight bend at $\sim$$2.5\times10^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$. No
statistically significant truncation is observed. From the cluster age
distributions, we find a low rate of disruption ($\zeta\sim-0.1$) in both the

0.8. The total molecular gas mass is estimated, using a N(H2)/Ico(1-0)=4e20
cm-2/(K km/s) conversion factor, to be 3.1e8 Msol. The CO spectra in the cube
were shifted to zero velocity by subtracting the velocity of the HI peak from
the CO spectra. Hence, the velocity dispersion between the atomic and molecular
components is extremely low, independently justifying the use of the HI line in
building our maps. Stacking the spectra in concentric rings shows that the CO
linewidth and possibly the CO-HI velocity dispersion decrease in the outer
disk. Using the CO(2-1) emission to trace the molecular gas, the probability
distribution function of the H2 column density shows an excess at high column
density above a log normal distribution.

new formulation predicts the constancy in time of any statistical halo velocity

this prediction by studying the evolution of a conserved halo population in
N-body simulations. We establish that the initial simulated halo density and

from the simple local Lagrangian bias. We demonstrate, for the first time, that
the time evolution of their velocity is in tension with the rapid decay

sparse vector, $S_t$, and a dense vector, $L_t$, which lies in a slowly
changing low-dimensional subspace, from $M_t:= S_t + L_t$ on-the-fly as new
data comes in. For initialization, it is assumed that an accurate knowledge of
the subspace in which $L_0$ lies is available. In recent works, Qiu et al
proposed and analyzed a novel solution to this problem called recursive
projected compressed sensing or ReProCS. In this work, we relax one limiting
assumption of Qiu et al's result. Their work required that the $L_t$'s be
mutually independent over time. However this is not a practical assumption,
e.g., in the video application, $L_t$ is the background image sequence and one
would expect it to be correlated over time. In this work we relax this and
allow the $L_t$'s to follow an autoregressive model. We are able to show that
under mild assumptions and under a denseness assumption on the unestimated part
of the changed subspace, with high probability (w.h.p.), ReProCS can exactly
recover the support set of $S_t$ at all times; the reconstruction errors of
both $S_t$ and $L_t$ are upper bounded by a time invariant and small value; and
the subspace recovery error decays to a small value within a finite delay of a
subspace change time. Because the last assumption depends on an algorithm
estimate, this result cannot be interpreted as a correctness result but only a
useful step towards it.

our approach for shear two-point correlations at $1$ to $300$ arcmin

medical diagnosis and estimation of sparse signals among other various
applications. Herein, active state tracking of a discrete-time, finite-state
Markov chain is considered. Noisy Gaussian observations are dynamically
collected by exerting appropriate control over their information content, while
incurring a related sensing cost. The objective is to devise sensing strategies
to optimize the trade-off between tracking performance and sensing cost. A
recently proposed Kalman-like estimator \cite{ZoisTSP14} is employed for state
tracking. The associated mean-squared error and a generic sensing cost metric
are then used in a partially observable Markov decision process formulation,
and the optimal sensing strategy is derived via a dynamic programming
recursion. The resulting recursion proves to be non-linear, challenging control
policy design. Properties of the related cost functions are derived and
sufficient conditions are provided regarding the structure of the optimal
control policy enabling characterization of when passive state tracking is
optimal. To overcome the associated computational burden of the optimal sensing
strategy, two lower complexity strategies are proposed, which exploit the
aforementioned properties. The performance of the proposed strategies is
illustrated in a wireless body sensing application, where cost savings as high
as $60\%$ are demonstrated for a $4\%$ detection error with respect to a static
equal allocation sensing strategy.

demonstrate a data post-processing approach which enables us to overcome this

obtained. This result enhances the resolution of possible comparisons between
remote optical clocks by a factor of 2. We confirm the theoretical prediction
with experimental data obtained on a 47 km metropolitan fiber link, and propose

from Class I to II. The 225 GHz continuum emission shows a weak (~23.6 mJy),
compact (<1000 AU) component associated with the central protostar. Our
simulated observations show that it can be explained by dust thermal emission
arising from an envelope which has a hole or a constant intensity region within
a few hundred AU of the protostar. This suggests the disappearance or a lower
concentration distribution of the envelope on a small scale. The 12CO and 13CO
emission exhibit molecular outflows to the south and north. The C18O emission
shows two molecular blobs, which correspond to the reflection nebulosity seen
in near-infrared images, while there is no C18O emission associated with the
protostar. The near-infrared features are likely due to the scattering at the
positions of the blobs. The visible scattering features should result from the
optical thinness of the envelope material, which is consistent with the
less-concentrated distribution in the continuum emission. From single-dish
observations, we found that the mass of the envelope (~1.5 Msun) + protostar
(~0.5 Msun) is comparable with the virial mass of M_vir=1.0 Msun within 40
arcsec. This suggests that the envelope is likely gravitationally bound. We
suggest that the protostellar envelope of L43 has been disappearing by
consumption through accretion, at least in the close vicinity of the protostar.

Shi","On discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of second-order derivatives","7 pages, submitted to Journal of Computational Physics",,,,"physics.comp-ph math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Some properties of a Local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) algorithm are
demonstrated for the problem of evaluting a second derivative $g = f_{xx}$ for
a given $f$. (This is a somewhat unusual problem, but it is useful for
understanding the initial transient response of an algorithm for diffusion
equations.) LDG uses an auxiliary variable to break this up into two first
order equations and then applies techniques by analogy to DG algorithms for
advection algorithms. This introduces an asymmetry into the solution that
depends on the choice of upwind directions for these two first order equations.
When using piecewise linear basis functions, this LDG solution $g_h$ is shown
not to converge in an $L_2$ norm because the slopes in each cell diverge.
However, when LDG is used in a time-dependent diffusion problem, this error in
the second derivative term is transient and rapidly decays away, so that the
overall error is bounded. I.e., the LDG approximation $f_h(x,t)$ for a
diffusion equation $\partial f / \partial t = f_{xx}$ converges to the proper
solution (as has been shown before), even though the initial rate of change
$\partial f_h / \partial t$ does not converge. We also show results from the
Recovery discontinuous Galerkin (RDG) approach, which gives symmetric solutions
that can have higher rates of convergence for a stencil that couples the same
number of cells.

discuss the basic properties of this norm when used as a regularization
functional and associated optimization problems, for which we derive equivalent
reformulations either more amenable to theory or to numerical computation.
Further focus of the analysis is put on the locally 1-sparse case, which is
well motivated by some biomedical imaging applications. Our computational
approaches are based on alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) and
appropriate splittings with augmented Lagrangians. Those are tested for a model
scenario related to dynamic positron emission tomography (PET), which is a
functional imaging technique in nuclear medicine. The results of this paper
provide insight into the potential impact of regularization with the
$\ell^{1,\infty}$-norm for local sparsity in appropriate settings. However, it
also indicates several shortcomings, possibly related to the non-tightness of
the functional as a relaxation of the $\ell^{0,\infty}$-norm.

calculated on the basis of the classical density functional theory combined
with the reference interaction site model for molecular liquids. The bridge
functions, which are neglected in the hypernetted-chain (HNC) approximation,
are taken into account through the density expansion for the Helmholtz free
energy functional up to the third order. A factorization approximation to the
ternary direct correlation functions in terms of the site-site pair correlation
functions is then employed in the expression of the bridge functions, thus
leading to a closed set of integral equations for the determination of the
RDFs. It is confirmed through numerical calculations that incorporation of the
oxygen-oxygen bridge function substantially improves the poor descriptions by
the HNC approximation at room temperature, e.g., for the second peak of the
oxygen-oxygen RDF.

likelihood method to measure a skill of forecast. The advantage of such an
approach is that earthquake rate prediction can in principle be adequately
combined with focal mechanism forecast, if both are based on the likelihood
scores, resulting in a general forecast optimization. To calculate the
likelihood score we need to compare actual forecasts or occurrences of
predicted events with the null hypothesis that the mechanism's 3-D orientation
is random. For double-couple source orientation the random probability
distribution function is not uniform, which complicates the calculation of the
likelihood value. To better understand the resulting complexities we calculate
the information (likelihood) score for two rotational distributions (Cauchy and
von Mises-Fisher), which are used to approximate earthquake source orientation
pattern. We then calculate the likelihood score for earthquake source forecasts
and for their validation by future seismicity data. Several issues need to be
explored when analyzing observational results: their dependence on forecast and
data resolution, internal dependence of scores on forecasted angle, and random
variability of likelihood scores. In this work we propose a preliminary
solution to these complex problems, as these issues need to be explored by a
more extensive statistical analysis.

all degrees of freedom (DOFs) commonly bound within the mechanical structure. A
typical problem for such robots is the instability produced by violent
transitions between walking phases in particular when a swinging leg impacts
the surface. Although extensive research on novel efficient walking algorithms
has been conducted, falls commonly appear as the walking speed increases or as
the terrain condition changes. This paper presents a polynomial trajectory
generation algorithm (PTA) to implement the walking on biped robots following
the cubic Hermitian polynomial interpolation between initial and final
conditions. The proposed algorithm allows smooth transitions between walking
phases, significantly reducing the possibility of falling. The algorithm has
been successfully tested by generating walking trajectories under different
terrain conditions on a biped robot of 10 DOFs. PTA has shown to be simple and
suitable to generate real time walking trajectories, despite reduced computing
resources of a commercial embedded microcontroller. Experimental evidence and
comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods demonstrates a better performance
of the proposed method in generating walking trajectories under different

extract the modular organization of transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs).
However, these approaches are not natural, as they try to cluster highly
connected genes into a module or locate known pleiotropic transcription factors
in lower hierarchical layers. Here, we unravel the TRN of Escherichia coli by
separating it into its key elements, thus revealing its natural organization.
We also present a mathematical criterion, based on the topological features of
the TRN, to classify the network elements into one of two possible classes:
hierarchical or modular genes.
  Results: We found that modular genes are clustered into physiologically
correlated groups validated by a statistical analysis of the enrichment of the
functional classes. Hierarchical genes encode transcription factors responsible
for coordinating module responses based on general interest signals.
Hierarchical elements correlate highly with the previously studied global
regulators, suggesting that this could be the first mathematical method to
identify global regulators. We identified a new element in TRNs never described
before: intermodular genes. These are structural genes that integrate, at the
promoter level, signals coming from different modules, and therefore from
different physiological responses. Using the concept of pleiotropy, we have
reconstructed the hierarchy of the network and discuss the role of feedforward
motifs in shaping the hierarchical backbone of the TRN.
  Conclusions: This study sheds new light on the design principles underpinning
the organization of TRNs, showing a novel nonpyramidal architecture composed of
independent modules globally governed by hierarchical transcription factors,
whose responses are integrated by intermodular genes.

radio pulses. Recent work by Thornton et al. (2013) has revealed a population
of FRBs in the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) survey at high Galactic
latitudes. A variety of progenitors have been proposed including cataclysmic
events at cosmological distances, Galactic flare stars, and terrestrial radio
frequency interference. Here we report on a search for FRBs at intermediate
Galactic latitudes ($-15^{\circ}$ $< b <$ 15$^{\circ}$) in data taken as part
of the HTRU survey. No FRBs were discovered in this region. Several effects
such as dispersion, scattering, sky temperature and scintillation decrease the
sensitivity by more than 3$\sigma$ in $\sim$20\% of survey pointings. Including
all of these effects, we exclude the hypothesis that FRBs are uniformly
distributed on the sky with 99\% confidence. This low probability implies that
additional factors -- not accounted for by standard Galactic models -- must be
included to ease the discrepancy between the detection rates at high and low
Galactic latitudes. A revised rate estimate or another strong and heretofore
unknown selection effect in Galactic latitude would provide closer agreement
between the surveys' detection rates. The dearth of detections at low Galactic
latitude disfavors a Galactic origin for these bursts.

What we observe in the gamma-ray band may be the tip-of-iceberg of more
extended underlying activities. The precursor emission, which is detected in
about 10% of {\em Swift} GRBs, is preferably detected in those GRBs that have a
massive star core-collapse origin. The soft extended emission (EE) tail, on the
other hand, is preferably detected in those GRBs that have a compact star
merger origin. Bright X-ray emission is detected during the BAT quiescent
phases prior to subsequent gamma-ray peaks, implying that X-ray emission may be
detectable prior the BAT trigger time. Future GRB alert instruments with soft

associated with regions of small overlap between landscape curvature and the
noise correlation function. Numerical simulations of this overlap in the

regimes that better support robust control solutions. This perspective shows
the dual importance of both noise statistics and the control form for

closed systems, we study coarse-grained decoherent histories. The system under
consideration is one-dimensional and consists of a particle coupled to a von
Neumann apparatus that measures its position. The particle moves in a quadratic
potential; in particular we consider a driven harmonic oscillator. The real
line is divided into intervals of the same length, and coarse-grained histories
are defined by the arithmetic average of the initial and final position of the
particle to be within one of these intervals. The position of the pointer
correlates with this arithmetic average. In addition a constant term is added
to this average, which is a result of the presence of a driving force on the
oscillator. We investigate decoherence for such histories via the decoherence
functional for the particle-apparatus. An exact expression for this functional
has been derived. If the particle or the pointer of the apparatus is in an
exact position state initially, then exact decoherence ensues, and the relative
probability for such histories is obtained. If the initial state of the
particle, which is centered at some arbitrary point in the $x$-axis, is narrow
compared to the width of the intervals on the $x$-axis, then we obtain
approximate decoherence. The same result follows if the initial state of the
pointer is narrow. In these two situations, we evaluate expressions for the
decoherence functional qualitatively and quantitatively. In the latter case we
obtain the first two terms in an expansion in powers of the width of the
initial state of the particle or the pointer respectively. Approximate relative
probabilities can be assigned in this case, and we have obtained an expansion
up to second order in powers of the width of the initial state for an
expression for an upper bound of these probabilities.

$\sum_{i=1}^{2l} s_i A_i$, where the $s_i$ are real information symbols and the

We show that the mutual orthogonality condition $A_iA_j^* + A_jA_i^*=0$ for
distinct basis matrices is not only sufficient but also necessary for fast
decodability. We build on this to show that for full-rate ($l = n^2$)
transmission, the decoding complexity can be no better than $|S|^{n^2+1}$,
where $|S|$ is the size of the effective real signal constellation. We also
show that for full-rate transmission, $g$-group decodability, as defined in
[1], is impossible for any $g \ge 2$. We then use the theory of Azumaya
algebras to derive bounds on the maximum number of groups into which the basis
matrices can be partitioned so that the matrices in different groups are
mutually orthogonal---a key measure of fast decodability. We show that in
general, this maximum number is of the order of only the $2$-adic value of $n$.
In the case where the matrices $A_i$ arise from a division algebra, which is
most desirable for diversity, we show that the maximum number of groups is only
$4$. As a result, the decoding complexity for this case is no better than
$|S|^{\lceil l/2 \rceil}$ for any rate $l$.

networks leveraging small cell network deployments, namely proactive caching.
Endowed with predictive capabilities and harnessing recent developments in
storage, context-awareness and social networks, peak traffic demands can be
substantially reduced by proactively serving predictable user demands, via
caching at base stations and users' devices. In order to show the effectiveness
of proactive caching, we examine two case studies which exploit the spatial and
social structure of the network, where proactive caching plays a crucial role.
Firstly, in order to alleviate backhaul congestion, we propose a mechanism
whereby files are proactively cached during off-peak demands based on file
popularity and correlations among users and files patterns. Secondly,
leveraging social networks and device-to-device (D2D) communications, we
propose a procedure that exploits the social structure of the network by
predicting the set of influential users to (proactively) cache strategic
contents and disseminate them to their social ties via D2D communications.
Exploiting this proactive caching paradigm, numerical results show that
important gains can be obtained for each case study, with backhaul savings and
a higher ratio of satisfied users of up to $22\%$ and $26\%$, respectively.
Higher gains can be further obtained by increasing the storage capability at
the network edge.

best secretary from $n$ candidates who come in a uniformly random order. In
this work we investigate a parallel generalizations of this problem introduced
by Feldman and Tennenholtz [14]. We call it shared $Q$-queue $J$-choice
$K$-best secretary problem. In this problem, $n$ candidates are evenly
distributed into $Q$ queues, and instead of hiring the best one, the employer
wants to hire $J$ candidates among the best $K$ persons. The $J$ quotas are
shared by all queues. This problem is a generalized version of $J$-choice
$K$-best problem which has been extensively studied and it has more practical
value as it characterizes the parallel situation.
  Although a few of works have been done about this generalization, to the best
of our knowledge, no optimal deterministic protocol was known with general $Q$
queues. In this paper, we provide an optimal deterministic protocol for this
problem. The protocol is in the same style of the $1\over e$-solution for the
classical secretary problem, but with multiple phases and adaptive criteria.
Our protocol is very simple and efficient, and we show that several
generalizations, such as the fractional $J$-choice $K$-best secretary problem
and exclusive $Q$-queue $J$-choice $K$-best secretary problem, can be solved
optimally by this protocol with slight modification and the latter one solves
an open problem of Feldman and Tennenholtz [14].
  In addition, we provide theoretical analysis for two typical cases, including
the 1-queue 1-choice $K$-best problem and the shared 2-queue 2-choice 2-best
problem. For the former, we prove a lower bound $1-O(\frac{\ln^2K}{K^2})$ of
the competitive ratio. For the latter, we show the optimal competitive ratio is
$\approx0.372$ while previously the best known result is 0.356 [14].

satisfactory, or at least widely agreed upon, solution. A number of theories,

differing acceptance among physicists. Most of the proposed theories try to
explain what happens during a QT measurement using a modification of the

observables or by making assumptions outside the scope of falsifiable physics.
This paper proposes a solution to the QT measurement problem in terms of a
model of the process for the evolution of two QT systems that interact in a way

the measured QT object and the measurement apparatus are ""normal"" interactions
which adhere to the laws of quantum field theory. This causes certain

speed can result in the formation of shocks. This phenomenon is observed not

(SNR) blast shells into the interstellar medium, but also in laboratory-based
laser-plasma experiments. These experiments and supporting simulations are thus
seen as an attractive platform for the small-scale reproduction and study of
astrophysical shocks in the laboratory. We model two plasma clouds, which
consist of electrons and ions, with a 2D PIC simulation. The ion temperatures
of both clouds differ by a factor of 10. Both clouds collide at a speed, which
is realistic for laboratory studies and for SNR shocks in their late evolution
phase like that of RCW86. A magnetic field, which is orthogonal to the
simulation plane, has a strength that is comparable to that at SNR shocks. A
forward shock forms between the overlap layer of both plasma clouds and the
cloud with the cooler ions. A large-amplitude ion acoustic wave is observed
between the overlap layer and the cloud with the hotter ions. It does not
steepen into a reverse shock, because its speed is below the ion acoustic
speed. A gradient of the magnetic field amplitude builds up close to the
forward shock as it compresses the magnetic field. This gradient gives rise to
an electron drift that is fast enough to trigger an instability. Electrostatic
ion acoustic wave turbulence develops ahead of the shock. It widens its
transition layer and thermalizes the ions, but the forward shock remains
intact.

activity and magnetism. As it permeates the interplanetary space, the stellar
wind interacts with any exoplanet encountered on its way, until it reaches the
interstellar medium (ISM). These interactions can result in complex physical
processes that depend on the characteristics of the wind. To better constrain
the wind characteristics, more realistic wind models that account for factors

paper, I present a three-dimensional model of the wind of cool stars, which
adopt as boundary condition observationally-derived magnetic maps. I also

counterexamples. We provide applications to real planar billiards:
classification of 4-reflective germs of real planar $C^4$-smooth
pseudo-billiards; solutions of Tabachnikov's Commuting Billiard Conjecture and
the 4-reflective case of Plakhov's Invisibility Conjecture (both in two

(and a reference implementation in R) we define a data structure 'hydra' that
partitions the infinite set of numbers into a finite set of partitions. On top
of this data structure we define an algorithm 'split' which sub-partitions each
partition using the modulus prime function. Hydra splitting along the natural
sequence of primes is a recursive version of wheel factorization. Hydra
recursion allows elementary proofs of some statements about primes. We consider
one new and two classical proof structures. Using these proof methods we find
that hydra recursion proves the infinity of twin primes. Then we show how to
use specific selections of primes to create hydras that contain pairs of
partitions with arbitrary even distance, which proves Maillet's conjecture and
the stricter 'consecutive existence conjecture'. Together with our proof

exist in the Universe. There is no established astrophysical explanation for
their origin and considerations have been made in the literature that those
massive black holes (MBHs) may be primordial black holes (PBHs), black holes
which are formed in the early universe (well before the matter-radiation
equality) due to the direct collapse of primordial overdensities. This paper
aims at discussing the possibility of excluding the PBH scenario as the origin
of the MBHs. We first revisit the constraints on PBHs obtained from the CMB
distortion that the seed density perturbation causes. By adopting a recent
computation of the CMB distortion sourced by the seed density perturbation and
the stronger constraint on the CMB distortion set by the COBE/FIRAS experiment
used in the literature, we find that PBHs in the mass range $6\times
10^4~M_\odot \sim 5 \times 10^{13}~M_\odot$ are excluded. Since PBHs lighter
than $6 \times 10^4~M_\odot$ are not excluded from the non-observation of the
CMB distortion, we propose a new method which can potentially exclude smaller
PBHs as well. Based on the observation that large density perturbations
required to create PBHs also result in the copious production of ultracompact
minihalos (UCMHs), compact dark matter halos formed at around the
recombination, we show that weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) as
dark matter annihilate efficiently inside UCMHs to yield cosmic rays far
exceeding the observed flux. Our bound gives severe restriction on the
compatibility between the particle physics models for WIMPs and the PBH
scenario as the explanation of MBHs.

  The low plasma beta values are then invoked to detect at least four
boundaries, two for the beginning and two for the end of an interplanetary
coronal mass ejection (ICME). Intermediate boundaries can be identified, as
indicated by other plasma and magnetic field signatures, and these ones mark
substructures of a complex event.
  Using the algorithm described in this article, we have compiled a list of the
ICME events registered by \emph{Ulysses} spacecraft during 2000-2002, with
their boundaries.
  After a statistical analysis, four relationships of the plasma beta with the
speed are then inferred for the computed ICMEs, for each of the four detected
boundaries in our compiled list.
  In order to exemplify the method we analyse in detail four events.
  This method provides premises for an alternative way of semi-automatic
detection of the interplanetary events' boundaries observed by \emph{Ulysses}

components that allows detection of plasma insulations and boundaries detection
for other satellites too.

also that under rather general conditions within the scheme considered the

their implications for neutrinoless double beta decay. In the GRA, GRB and HG

between the TBM, BM (LC), GRA, GRB and HG forms of $U_{\nu}$ requires a

attracting much attention in computer vision and machine learning. The NNM
problem is capitalized on its convexity and it can be solved efficiently. The
standard nuclear norm regularizes all singular values equally, which is however
not flexible enough to fit real scenarios. Weighted nuclear norm minimization
(WNNM) is a natural extension and generalization of NNM. By assigning properly
different weights to different singular values, WNNM can lead to
state-of-the-art results in applications such as image denoising. Nevertheless,
so far the global optimal solution of WNNM problem is not completely solved yet
due to its non-convexity in general cases. In this article, we study the
theoretical properties of WNNM and prove that WNNM can be equivalently
transformed into a quadratic programming problem with linear constraints. This
implies that WNNM is equivalent to a convex problem and its global optimum can
be readily achieved by off-the-shelf convex optimization solvers. We further
show that when the weights are non-descending, the globally optimal solution of
WNNM can be obtained in closed-form.

complexity were recently proposed to quantify the minimum amount of resources
needed in generating bipartite classical or quantum states in the single-shot
setting. The former is the minimum size of the initially shared state $\sigma$
on which local operations by the two parties (without communication) can
generate the target state $\rho$, and the latter is the minimum amount of
communication needed when initially sharing nothing. In this paper, we
generalize these two concepts to multipartite cases, for both exact and
approximate state generation. Our results are summarized as follows. (1) For
multipartite pure states, the correlation complexity can be completely
characterized by local ranks of sybsystems. (2) We extend the notion of
PSD-rank of matrices to that of tensors, and use it to bound the quantum
correlation complexity for generating multipartite classical distributions. (3)
For generating multipartite mixed quantum states, communication complexity is
not always equal to correlation complexity (as opposed to bipartite case). But
they differ by at most a factor of 2. Generating a multipartite mixed quantum
state has the same communication complexity as generating its optimal
purification. But for correlation complexity of these two tasks can be
different (though still related by less than a factor of 2). (4) To generate a
bipartite classical distribution $P(x,y)$ approximately, the quantum
communication complexity is completely characterized by the approximate
PSD-rank of $P$. The quantum correlation complexity of approximately generating
multipartite pure states is bounded by approximate local ranks.

at a constant luminosity, which is incompatible with the observed facts. In
wind stripping effect (3), the ram pressure of a typical stellar wind is not

clusters. We focus on their secular evolution due to the perturbation by the

with highly inclined orbits in respect to their orbit around the MBH are
strongly affected by secular processes, which periodically change their
eccentricities and inclinations (e.g. Kozai--Lidov cycles). During periapsis
approach, dissipative processes such as tidal friction may become highly
efficient, and may lead to shrinkage of a binary orbit and even to its merger.
Binaries in this environment can therefore significantly change their orbital
evolution due to the MBH third-body perturbative effects. Such orbital
evolution may impinge on their later stellar evolution. Here we follow the
secular dynamics of such binaries and its coupling to tidal evolution, as well
as the stellar evolution of such binaries on longer time-scales. We find that
stellar binaries in the central parts of NSCs are highly likely to evolve into
eccentric and/or short period binaries, and become strongly interacting
binaries either on the main sequence (at which point they may even merge), or
through their later binary stellar evolution. The central parts of NSCs
therefore catalyze the formation and evolution of strongly interacting
binaries, and lead to the enhanced formation of blue stragglers, X-ray
binaries, gravitational wave sources and possible supernova progenitors.
Induced mergers/collisions may also lead to the formation of G2-like cloud-like

for the nonparametric functions estimators for both finite and high-dimensional
cases. The proposed method and theoretical development are quite challenging
since the numbers of linear covariates and nonlinear components both increase
as the sample size increases. We also propose a doubly penalized procedure for
variable selection which can simultaneously identify nonzero linear and
nonparametric components, and which has an asymptotic oracle property.
Extensive Monte Carlo studies have been conducted and show that the proposed
procedure works effectively even with moderate sample sizes. A pharmacokinetics
study on renal cancer data is illustrated using the proposed method.

for only very little velocity noise and enforces a very regular particle

elements that enhance the treatment of fluid instabilities and, last, but not

the only source of plasma heating during all phases of both events. The flares
were observed by RHESSI and GOES on February 20th, 2002 and June 2nd, 2002,
respectively. Using a 1D hydrodynamic code for both flares the energy deposited
in the chromosphere was derived applying RHESSI observational data. The use of
the Fokker-Planck formalism permits the calculation of distributions of the
NTEs in flaring loops, thus spatial distributions of the X-ray non-thermal
emissions and integral fluxes for the selected energy ranges which were
compared with the observed ones. The best compatibility of the model with the
observations was obtained for the June 2nd, 2002 event in both the 0.5-4 A GOES
range and total fluxes in the 6-12 keV, 12-25 keV, 20-25 keV and 50- 100 keV
energy bands. Results of photometry of the individual flaring structures in a
high energy range shows that the best compliance occurred for the June 2nd,
2002 flare, where the synthesized emissions were 30% or more higher than the
observed emissions. Some part of these differences may be caused by inevitable
flaws of the applied methodology, like by an assumption that the model of the
flare is symmetric and there are no differences in the emissions originating
from the feet of the flare's loop and by relative simplicity of the applied
numerical 1D code and procedures. Despite these problems, a collation of
modelled results with observations shows that soft and hard X-ray emissions
observed for analysed single-loop like events may be fully explained by

devices that come into contact with liquids below the freezing point.
Resistance of some organisms to ice formation and growth, either in subtidal
environments (e.g. Antarctic anchor ice), or in environments with moisture and
cold air (e.g. plants, intertidal) begs examination of how this is
accomplished. Several factors may be important in promoting or mitigating ice
formation. As a start, here we examine the effect of surface texture alone. We
tested four candidate surfaces, inspired by hard-shelled marine invertebrates
and constructed using a three-dimensional printing process. We screened
biological and artifical samples for ice formation and accretion in submerged
conditions using previous methods, and developed a new test to examine ice
formation from surface droplets as might be encountered in environments with
moist, cold air. It appears surface texture plays only a small role in delaying
the onset of ice formation: a stripe feature (corresponding to patterning found
on valves of blue mussels, Crassostrea gigas, or on the spines of the Antarctic
sea urchin, Sterechinus neumayeri) slowed ice formation an average of 25%
compared to a grid feature (corresponding to patterning found on sub-polar
butterclams, Saxidomas). The geometric dimensions of the features have only a
small (~6%) effect on ice formation. Surface texture affects ice formation, but
does not explain by itself the large variation in ice formation and
species-specific ice resistance observed in other work. This suggests future
examination of other factors, such as material elastic properties and coatings,
and their interaction with surface pattern.

disperse with an e-folding time of $\sim$ 3Myr. This is in striking contrast
with recent observations that suggest evidence for numerous $>30$ Myr old stars
with an accretion disc in large star-forming complexes. We consider whether
these observations of apparently old accretors could be explained by invoking
Bondi-Hoyle accretion to rebuild a new disc around these stars during passage
through a clumpy molecular cloud. We combine a simple Monte Carlo model to
explore the capture of mass by such systems with a viscous evolution model to
infer the levels of accretion that would be observed. We find that a
significant fraction of stars may capture enough material via the Bondi-Hoyle
mechanism to rebuild a disc of mass $\gtrsim$ 1 minimum-mass solar nebula, and
$\lesssim 10\%$ accrete at observable levels at any given time. A significant
fraction of the observed old accretors may be explained with our proposed
mechanism. Such accretion may provide a chance for a second epoch of planet
formation, and have unpredictable consequences for planetary evolution.

quantize channel direction information (CDI). For multiuser (MU) systems with
matched-filter (MF) precoding, we show that the number of feedback bits
required by the random vector quantization (RVQ) codebook to match even a small
fraction of the perfect CDI signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
performance is large. With such large numbers of bits, the exhaustive search
required by conventional codebook approaches make them infeasible for massive
MISO systems. Motivated by this, we propose a differential TCQ scheme for
temporally correlated channels that transforms the source constellation at each
stage in a trellis using 2D translation and scaling techniques. We derive a
scaling parameter for the source constellation as a function of the temporal
correlation and the number of BS antennas. We also propose a TCQ based limited
feedback scheme for spatially correlated channels where the channel is
quantized directly without performing decorrelation at the receiver. Simulation
results show that the proposed TCQ schemes outperform the existing noncoherent
TCQ (NTCQ) schemes, by improving the spectral efficiency and beamforming gain
of the system. The proposed differential TCQ also reduces the feedback overhead
of the system compared to the differential NTCQ method.

we exhibit a soliton structure on most of symplectic surfaces which are Lie

-- Tolman (L--T) model with $\Lambda = 0$, constant bang-time function $t_B$
and the energy function $E(r)$ mimicking accelerated expansion on the
observer's past light cone ($r$ is a uniquely defined comoving radial
coordinate). Numerical experiments show that $E > 0$ necessarily. The functions
$z(r)$ and $E(r)$ are numerically calculated from the initial point at the
observer's position; then backward from the initial point at the apparent
horizon (AH). Reconciling the results of the two calculations allows one to
determine the values of $E/r^2$ at $r = 0$ and at the AH. The problems
connected with continuing the calculation through the AH are discussed in
detail and solved. Then $z(r)$ and $E(r)$ are continued beyond the AH, up to
the numerical crash that signals the contact of the light cone with the Big
Bang. Similarly, the light cone of the L--T model is calculated by proceeding
from the two initial points, and compared with the $\Lambda$CDM light cone. The
model constructed here contains shell crossings, but they can be removed by
matching the L--T region to a Friedmann background, without causing any
conflict with the type Ia supernovae observations. The mechanism of imitating
the accelerated expansion by the $E(r)$ function is explained in a descriptive

of the $\Lambda N$ interaction, the $\Lambda$ particle gets to move more deeply
inside the core and invokes strongly the spatial core shrinkage, and
accordingly distinct localized $2\alpha$ clusters appear in the nucleonic
intrinsic density, though in ${^{8}{\rm Be}}$ rather gaslike $2\alpha$-cluster

strong effect of Pauli principle. We conclude that the container picture of the

localization of clusters is shown in the density distribution.

synthesis methods is measured in terms of quantum cost, gate cost, garbage

explore the trade-off between quantum cost and garbage lines. The proposed

demonstrate by detailed experiments that controlled improvement in quantum cost

(VHE; E>100 GeV) gamma-ray source candidates. It is energized by one of the
highest spin-down power pulsars known (5% of Crab pulsar) and it has been
compared to the Crab Nebula due to their morphological similarities. This
object was previously observed by imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes
(Whipple, VERITAS and MAGIC), although not detected, with an upper limit of
2.4% Crab Unit (C.U.) at VHE. It was detected by Fermi-LAT with a spectrum
extending beyond 100 GeV. We analyzed 81 hours of 3C 58 data taken with the
MAGIC telescopes and we detected VHE gamma-ray emission with a significance of
5.7 sigma and an integral flux of 0.65% C.U. above 1 TeV. The differential
energy spectrum between 400 GeV and 10 TeV is well described by a power-law
function d\phi/dE=f_0(E/1TeV)^{-Gamma} with
f_0=(2.0\pm0.4_{stat}\pm0.6_{sys})\times10^{-13}cm^{-2}s^{-1}TeV^{-1} and
Gamma=2.4\pm0.2_{stat}\pm0.2_{sys}. The skymap is compatible with an unresolved
source. We report the first significant detection of PWN 3C 58 at TeV energies.
According to our results 3C 58 is the least luminous VHE gamma-ray PWN ever
detected at VHE and the one with the lowest flux at VHE to date. We compare our
results with the expectations of time-dependent models in which electrons
up-scatter photon fields. The best representation favors a distance to the PWN
of 2 kpc and Far Infrared (FIR) comparable to CMB photon fields. If we consider
an unexpectedly high FIR density, the data can also be reproduced by models
assuming a 3.2 kpc distance. A low magnetic field, far from equipartition, is
required to explain the VHE data. Hadronic contribution from the hosting
supernova remnant (SNR) requires unrealistic energy budget given the density of
the medium, disfavoring cosmic ray acceleration in the SNR as origin of the VHE
gamma-ray emission.

trade-off between the fidelity and the duration in a system driven by a
time-varying control. The problem is addressed in the framework of Hilbert
space geometry offering an intuitive interpretation of optimal control
algorithms. This approach is applied to non-uniform time variations which leads
to a necessary criterion for control optimality applicable as a measure of
algorithm convergence. The time fidelity trade-off expressed in terms of the
direct Hilbert velocity provides a robust prediction of the quantum speed limit
and allows to adapt the control optimization such that it yields a predefined
fidelity. The results are verified numerically in a multilevel system with a
constrained Hamiltonian, and a classification scheme for the control sequences
is proposed based on their optimizability.

interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs) were observed near the Earth, and are propagated
outward from 1 AU using an MHD model. The transient streams interact with each

investigate an extreme event with multi-point remote-sensing and in-situ

features. We suggest that the in-transit interaction between two closely
launched coronal mass ejections resulted in the extreme enhancement of the
ejecta magnetic field observed near 1 AU at STEREO A. The fast transit to
STEREO A (in only 18.6 hours), or the unusually weak deceleration of the event,
was caused by the preconditioning of the upstream solar wind by an earlier

states in the temperature range $266-333$ K and pressure range $0.1-300$ MPa,
for relaxation times around $10^{-3}$ s and $10^{-4}$ s. From the isomorph
statement that there is structural and dynamic invariance of isomorph states in

frequency-dependent term $\chi_{e}(f) \rho^{\gamma-1}$, with electric
susceptibility $\chi_{e}$, density $\rho$, and density-scaling factor $\gamma$.
Due to the unique design of our experimental setup, we obtain dielectric loss
data where the amplitude is reproducible $\pm 0.1 \%$. We moreover find that
the empty capacitance of the capacitor cell is stable within $\pm 0.3 \%$ in
our measuring range and can be assumed to be constant. Using this we predict
for two isomorph states there is $-C_{2}""(f)= -C_{1}""(f) \left(\rho_1 / \rho_2

transporting electron anti-neutrinos from the core to behind the shock where
they provide additional heating leading to much larger explosion kinetic

conversion to sterile neutrinos that shuts off the conversion, followed by a

We demand that the required residual symmetries of the leptonic mass matrices

SU(3) if the third neutrino is massive and we derive general results on the
mixing angle predictions for various discrete subgroups of SU(3). The main
results are: (a) All the SU(3) subgroups of type C fail in simultaneously
giving correct $\theta_{13}$ and $\theta_{23}$. (b) All the groups of type D
can predict a relation $\cos^2\theta_{13} \sin^2\theta_{23}=\frac{1}{3}$ among
the mixing angles which appears to be a good zeroth order approximation. Among
these, various $\Delta(6n^2)$ groups with $n\geq 8$ can simultaneously lead
also to $\sin^2 \theta_{13}$ in agreement with global fit at 3$\sigma$. (c) The
group $\Sigma(168)\cong PSL(2,7)$ predicts near to the best fit value for
$\theta_{13}$ and $\theta_{23}$ within the 1$\sigma$ range. All discrete
subgroups of U(3) with order $<512$ and having three dimensional irreducible
representation are considered as possible $G_f$ when the third neutrino is
massless. Only seven of them are shown to be viable and three of these can
correctly predict $\theta_{13}$ and/or $\theta_{23}$. The solar angle remains
undetermined at the leading order in all the cases due to degeneracy in the
masses. A class of general perturbations which can correctly reproduce all the
observables are discussed in the context of several groups which offer good
leading order predictions.

minimises the complexity of construction. First test results are presented,
demonstrating a successful signal extraction. The geometry consists of a
sampling calorimeter with passive absorber layers interleaved with layers of an
active medium made of inorganic scintillating crystals. Wavelength-shifting
(WLS) fibres run along the four long, chamfered edges of the stack,
transporting the light to photodetectors at the rear. To maximise the amount of
scintillation light reaching the WLS fibres, the scintillator chamfers are
depolished. It is shown herein that this concept is working for cerium fluoride

materials have been tested as WLS medium. In particular, materials that might
be sufficiently resistant to the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider
radiation environment, such as cerium-doped Lutetium-Yttrium Orthosilicate

fibres. Finally, an outlook is presented on the possible optimisation of the
different components, and the construction and commissioning of a full

data provide an explicit historical perspective that critically informs
research in a vast and growing number of scientific disciplines. One such use
is the study of changes in rates of lineage diversification (speciation -
extinction) through time. As part of a meta-analysis in this area, we sought to
collect phylogenetic data (comprising nucleotide sequence alignment and tree
files) from 217 studies published in 46 journals over a 13-year period. We
document our attempts to procure those data (from online archives and by direct

Bayesian logistic regression) to assess the impact of various factors on the
success of our efforts. Overall, complete phylogenetic data for ~60% of these
studies are effectively lost to science. Our study indicates that phylogenetic
data are more likely to be deposited in online archives and/or shared upon
request when: (1) the publishing journal has a strong data-sharing policy; (2)
the publishing journal has a higher impact factor, and; (3) the data are
requested from faculty rather than students. Although the situation appears
dire, our analyses suggest that it is far from hopeless: recent initiatives by

come with many advantages to control and monitoring. However, in the wrong
hands, the data might pose a privacy threat. In this paper, we consider the
tradeoff between smart grid operations and the privacy of consumers. We analyze
the tradeoff between smart grid operations and how often data is collected by
considering a realistic direct-load control example using thermostatically
controlled loads, and we give simulation results to show how its performance
degrades as the sampling frequency decreases. Additionally, we introduce a new
privacy metric, which we call inferential privacy. This privacy metric assumes
a strong adversary model, and provides an upper bound on the adversary's
ability to infer a private parameter, independent of the algorithm he uses.
Combining these two results allow us to directly consider the tradeoff between
better load control and consumer privacy.

  Projections","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing",,"10.1109/TSP.2014.2385040",,"cs.IT cs.DS math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the framework of multidimensional Compressed Sensing (CS), we introduce an
analytical reconstruction formula that allows one to recover an $N$th-order
$(I_1\times I_2\times \cdots \times I_N)$ data tensor $\underline{\mathbf{X}}$
from a reduced set of multi-way compressive measurements by exploiting its low
multilinear-rank structure. Moreover, we show that, an interesting property of
multi-way measurements allows us to build the reconstruction based on
compressive linear measurements taken only in two selected modes, independently
of the tensor order $N$. In addition, it is proved that, in the matrix case and
in a particular case with $3$rd-order tensors where the same 2D sensor operator
is applied to all mode-3 slices, the proposed reconstruction
$\underline{\mathbf{X}}_\tau$ is stable in the sense that the approximation
error is comparable to the one provided by the best low-multilinear-rank
approximation, where $\tau$ is a threshold parameter that controls the
approximation error. Through the analysis of the upper bound of the
approximation error we show that, in the 2D case, an optimal value for the
threshold parameter $\tau=\tau_0 > 0$ exists, which is confirmed by our
simulation results. On the other hand, our experiments on 3D datasets show that
very good reconstructions are obtained using $\tau=0$, which means that this
parameter does not need to be tuned. Our extensive simulation results
demonstrate the stability and robustness of the method when it is applied to
real-world 2D and 3D signals. A comparison with state-of-the-arts sparsity
based CS methods specialized for multidimensional signals is also included. A
very attractive characteristic of the proposed method is that it provides a
direct computation, i.e. it is non-iterative in contrast to all existing
sparsity based CS algorithms, thus providing super fast computations, even for
large datasets.
