periodic orbits and study their properties. 2) Formulate the new system as a

of hybrid systems is not structurally stable based on phase transition which
can be applied to higher-dimensional cases effortlessly. 4) Simulate a

of continuous-time hybrid systems as the counterparts of the discrete-time

buckled 2D hexagonal lattices expressed in terms of Dirac matrices in the Weyl
basis. The Hamiltonian of these systems comprises of the Dirac kinetic energy,
a mass gap term, and the spin-orbit coupling. The second term breaks the
sub-lattice symmetry of the honey-comb lattice structure and generates a gap.
The buckled structure generates a staggered sub-lattice potential between
silicon atoms at A sites and B sites for an applied electric field
perpendicular to its plane. Tuning of the electric field, allows for rich
behavior varying from a topological insulator to a band insulator with a valley
spin-polarized metal at a critical value in between. Thus, the mobile electrons
in silicene or germanene are coupled differently compared to graphene to an
external electric field. Our preliminary investigation have shown that, as long
as the non-magnetic impurity scattering strength is moderate, i.e. the strength
is of the same order as the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling of 4 meV, valley-spin
polarized metal phase is protected. The effective ""two-component Dirac physics""
remains valid in this phase. The increase in the electric field beyond the
critical value leads to the valley magnetic moment reversal. The enhancement in
the impurity scattering strength, however, leads to the disappearance of the
polarized metal phase due to accentuated intra- and inter-valley scattering
processes. This disappearance does not occur due to the increase in Rashba
spin-orbit coupling effect.

in this article we describe our studies of multi-pion correlation functions
computed using stochastic propagators in quenched lattice QCD, harnessing GPUs
for acceleration. We consider two methods for constructing the correlation
functions. One ""outer product"" approach becomes quite expensive at large
lattice extent $L$, having an ${\cal O}(L^7)$ scaling. The other ""stochastic
operator"" approach scales as ${\cal O}(N_r^2 L^4)$, where $N_r$ is the number
of random sources. It would become more efficient if variance reduction
techniques are used and the volume is fairly large. It is also found that
correlations between stochastic propagators appearing in the same diagram, when
a single set of random source vectors is used, lead to much larger errors than
if separate random sources are used for each propagator. The calculations
involve states with quantum numbers of the vacuum, so all-to-all propagators
must be computed. For this reason, GPUs are ideally suited to accelerating the
calculation. For this work we have integrated the Columbia Physics System (CPS)
and QUDA GPU inversion library, in the case of clover fermions. Finally, we
show that the completely quark disconnected diagram is crucial to the results,
and that neglecting it would lead to answers which are far from the true value
for the effective mass in this channel. This is unfortunate, because as we also
show, this diagram has very large errors, and in fact dominates the error
budget.

(GC) that were formed some Ma ago. A fraction of these stars has been found to
orbit the supermassive black hole, SgrA*, in a projected clockwise disk, which
suggests that they were formed in a formerly existing dense disk around SgrA*.
We focus on the extended, near-infrared (NIR) sources IRS1W, IRS5, IRS10W, and
IRS21 that have been suggested to be young, massive stars that form bow-shocks
through their interaction with the ISM. Their nature has impeded accurate
determination of their orbital parameters. We aim at establishing their nature
and kinematics to test whether they form part of the clockwise disk. We
performed NIR multi-wavelength imaging using adaptive optics (AO) and sparse
aperture masking (SAM). We introduce a new method for self-calibration of the
SAM PSF in dense stellar fields. The emission mechanism, morphology and
kinematics of the targets were examined via 3D bow-shock models. We confirm
previous findings that IRS21, IRS1W, and IRS5 are bow-shocks created by the
interaction between mass-losing stars and the interstellar gas. The nature of
IRS10W remains unclear. Our modeling shows that the bow-shock-emission is
caused by thermal emission while the scattering of stellar light does not play
any significant role. IRS 1W appears to be a bow-shock produced by an
anisotropic stellar wind or by locally inhomogeneous ISM density. Our best-fit
models provide an estimate of the local proper motion of the ISM in the NA in
agreement with the published models. Assuming that all of the sources are tied
to SgrA*, their orbital planes were obtained via a Monte-Carlo simulation. Our
orbital analysis suggests that they are not part of any of the clockwise disk.
We thus add more evidence to recent findings that a large part of the massive
stars show apparently random orbital orientations.

questions from the large deviation theory and extended Ito's theory of SDEs;
the recent applications contribute to (Graham) automated recognition of Chinese
handwriting and (Hairer) formulation of appropriate SPDEs to model randomly

describing a smooth but potentially highly oscillatory and vector valued path
$x_{t}$ parsimoniously so as to effectively predict the response of a nonlinear
system such as $dy_{t}=f(y_{t})dx_{t}$, $y_{0}=a$. The Signature is a
homomorphism from the monoid of paths into the grouplike elements of a closed
tensor algebra. It provides a graduated summary of the path $x$. Hambly and
Lyons have shown that this non-commutative transform is faithful for paths of
bounded variation up to appropriate null modifications. Among paths of bounded
variation with given Signature there is always a unique shortest
representative. These graduated summaries or features of a path are at the
heart of the definition of a rough path; locally they remove the need to look
at the fine structure of the path. Taylor's theorem explains how any smooth
function can, locally, be expressed as a linear combination of certain special
functions (monomials based at that point). Coordinate iterated integrals form a
more subtle algebra of features that can describe a stream or path in an
analogous way; they allow a definition of rough path and a natural linear

in 3C silicon carbide (SiC) similar to the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy
center in diamond has the potential to enable the integration of defect qubits
into established wafer scale device architectures for quantum information and
sensing applications. Here we demonstrate the design, fabrication, and
characterization of photonic crystal cavities in 3C SiC films with incorporated
ensembles of color centers and quality factor (Q) to mode volume ratios similar
to those achieved in diamond. Simulations show that optimized H1 and L3
structures exhibit Q as high as 45,000 and mode volumes of approximately
$(\lambda/n)^{3}$. We utilize the internal color centers as a source of
broadband excitation to characterize fabricated structures with resonances
tuned to the color center zero phonon line and observe Q in the range of
900-1,500 with narrowband photoluminescence collection enhanced by up to a
factor of 10. By comparing the Q factors observed for different geometries with
finite-difference time-domain simulations, we find evidence that nonvertical
sidewalls are likely the dominant source of discrepancies between our simulated
and measured Q factors. These results indicate that defect qubits in 3C SiC
thin films show clear promise as a simple, scalable platform for interfacing
defect qubits with photonic, optoelectronic, and optomechanical devices.

attention recently. Most existing methods approach this problem by taking steps
obtained from approximating the objective by a quadratic approximation that is
decoupled at the individual variable level. These methods are designed for
multicore and MPI platforms where communication costs are low. They are
inefficient on systems such as Hadoop running on a cluster of commodity
machines where communication costs are substantial. In this paper we design a
distributed algorithm for $l_1$ regularization that is much better suited for
such systems than existing algorithms. A careful cost analysis is used to
support these points and motivate our method. The main idea of our algorithm is
to do block optimization of many variables on the actual objective function
within each computing node; this increases the computational cost per step that
is matched with the communication cost, and decreases the number of outer
iterations, thus yielding a faster overall method. Distributed Gauss-Seidel and
Gauss-Southwell greedy schemes are used for choosing variables to update in
each step. We establish global convergence theory for our algorithm, including
Q-linear rate of convergence. Experiments on two benchmark problems show our
method to be much faster than existing methods.

extending the classical Hartle-Thorne formalism to generic scalar-tensor

momentum, we compute the mass M, radius R, scalar charge q, moment of inertia I
and spin-induced quadrupole moment Q, as well as the tidal and rotational Love
numbers. Our formalism applies to generic scalar-tensor theories, but we focus
in particular on theories that allow for spontaneous scalarization. It was
recently discovered that the moment of inertia, quadrupole moment and Love
numbers are connected by approximately universal (i.e., equation-of-state
independent) ""I-Love-Q"" relations. We find that similar relations hold also for
spontaneously scalarized stars. More interestingly, the I-Love-Q relations in
scalar-tensor theories coincide with the general relativistic ones within less
than a few percent, even for spontaneously scalarized stars with the largest
couplings allowed by current binary-pulsar constraints. This implies that
astrophysical measurements of these parameters cannot be used to discriminate
between general relativity and scalar-tensor theories, even if spontaneous
scalarization occurs in nature. Because of the well known equivalence between
f(R) theories and scalar-tensor theories, the theoretical framework developed
in this paper can be used to construct rotating compact stellar models in f(R)
gravity. Our slow-rotation expansion can also be used as a benchmark for
numerical calculations of rapidly spinning neutron stars in generic
scalar-tensor theories.

executing each instruction in a processor's instruction set. This can be used
to determine how much energy is required to execute a sequence of assembly
instructions, without the need to instrument or measure hardware.
  However, statically analyzing low-level program structures is hard, and the
gap between the high-level program structure and the low-level energy models
needs to be bridged. We have developed techniques for performing a static
analysis on the intermediate compiler representations of a program.
Specifically, we target LLVM IR, a representation used by modern compilers,
including Clang. Using these techniques we can automatically infer an estimate
of the energy consumed when running a function under different platforms, using
different compilers.
  One of the challenges in doing so is that of determining an energy cost of
executing LLVM IR program segments, for which we have developed two different
approaches. When this information is used in conjunction with our analysis, we
are able to infer energy formulae that characterize the energy consumption for
a particular program. This approach can be applied to any languages targeting
the LLVM toolchain, including C and XC or architectures such as ARM Cortex-M or
XMOS xCORE, with a focus towards embedded platforms. Our techniques are
validated on these platforms by comparing the static analysis results to the
physical measurements taken from the hardware. Static energy consumption
estimation enables energy-aware software development, without requiring
hardware knowledge.

between life and its abiotic environment is able to produce plausible
equilibrium states with the necessary physical conditions for the existence and
persistence of life itself. We support our hypothesis of an InHZ with three
theoretical arguments, multiple evidences coming from observations of the Earth
system, several conceptual experiments and illustrative numerical simulations.
Conceptually the diference between the InHZ and the Abiotic HZ (AHZ) depends on
unique and robust properties of life as an emergent physical phenomenon and not
necesarily on the particular life forms bearing in the planet. Our aim here is
to provide conceptual basis for the development of InHZ models incorporating
consistently life-environment interactions. Although previous authors have
explored the effects of life on habitability there is a gap in research
developing the reasons why life should be systematically included at
determining the HZ limits. We do not provide here definitive limits to the InHZ
but we show through simple numerical models (as a parable of an inhabited
planet) how the limits of the AHZ could be modified by including plausible
interactions between biota and its environment. These examples aim also at
posing the question that if limits of the HZ could be modified by the presence
of life in those simple dynamical systems how will those limits change if life
is included in established models of the AHZ.

binary MRFs with arbitrary pairwise potentials, which could be nonsubmodular

approach and several recent promising methods. From our study, we make some
reasonable recommendations of combining existing methods that perform the best
in different situations for this challenging problem. Experimental results
validate that for dense and nonsubmodular energy functions, the proposed

results reveal that no spin polarization appears in two-terminal molecular

of finite-width electrodes if there is a \emph{bottleneck} of one single site

necessary to induce spin-filtering effects. In contrast, nonzero spin
polarization is found in molecular devices with multiple terminals or with two
finite-width electrodes, each of them connected to more than one site of the
molecule. Then, the magnitude of spin polarization can be enhanced by
increasing the asymmetry between the two strands. We point out that the

the connection between the molecule and the electrodes.

basis of the fact that the adaptive weight vector lies in the
signal-plus-interference subspace. Consequently, by using the well-known linear
kernel methods with very good small-sample performance, only a low-dimension

weight vector itself, which remarkably reduces the degree of freedom and the
computational complexity. Experimental results validate the good performance

noisy speech processing, it is hard to know the optimal cut-off portion to
remove the outliers and sometimes removes useful data samples as well. In this
paper, we propose a new method based on measuring the dispersion degree (DD) of

For each one, we theoretically prove that the DD of the data samples in a

distribution. The proposed method is evaluated on a real-world application with
a moderately-sized speaker recognition task. Experiments show that the proposed

perform such minimizations, and it is often thought that a main source of
difficulty for the ability of these local methods to find the global minimum is
the proliferation of local minima with much higher error than the global
minimum. Here we argue, based on results from statistical physics, random
matrix theory, and neural network theory, that a deeper and more profound
difficulty originates from the proliferation of saddle points, not local
minima, especially in high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such
saddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically slow
down learning, and give the illusory impression of the existence of a local
minimum. Motivated by these arguments, we propose a new algorithm, the
saddle-free Newton method, that can rapidly escape high dimensional saddle
points, unlike gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods. We apply this
algorithm to deep neural network training, and provide preliminary numerical
evidence for its superior performance.

non-spherical virialized dark halos, which reflect the process of mass assembly
in the galactic scale. Applying our models to the latest kinematic data of
globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Andromeda halo, we find
that the most plausible cases for Andromeda yield a prolate shape for its dark
halo, irrespective of assumed density profiles. We also find that this prolate
dark halo in Andromeda is consistent with theoretical predictions in which the
satellites are distributed anisotropically and preferentially located along
major axes of their host halos. It is a reflection of the intimate connection
between galactic dark matter halos and the cosmic web. Therefore, our result is
profound in understanding internal dynamics of halo tracers in Andromeda, such
as orbital evolutions of tidal stellar streams, which play important roles in
extracting the abundance of CDM subhalos through their dynamical effects on

analyses the temporal evolution of coronal source heating and the chromospheric
response during this pre-heating phase to investigate the origin and nature of
early energy release and transport during a solar flare. Simultaneous X-ray,
EUV, and microwave observations of a well observed flare with a prolonged
pre-heating phase are analysed to study the time evolution of the thermal
emission and to determine the onset of particle acceleration. During the 20
minutes duration of the pre-heating phase we find no hint of accelerated
electrons, neither in hard X-rays nor in microwave emission. However, the total
energy budget during the pre-heating phase suggests that energy must be
supplied to the flaring loop to sustain the observed temperature and emission
measure. Under the assumption of this energy being transported toward the
chromosphere via thermal conduction, significant energy deposition at the
chromosphere is expected. However, no detectable increase of the emission in
the AIA wavelength channels sensitive to chromospheric temperatures is
observed. The observations suggest energy release and deposition in the flaring
loop before the onset of particle acceleration, yet a model in which energy is
conducted to the chromosphere and subsequent heating of the chromosphere is not

enlarge the performance difference between a legitimate receiver (LR) and an
unauthorized receiver (UR) in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless
system. Specifically, it makes use of properly designed training signals to
degrade channel estimation at the UR which in turn limits the UR's
eavesdropping capability during data transmission. In this paper, we propose a
new two-way training scheme for DCE through exploiting a whitening-rotation
(WR) based semiblind method. To characterize the performance of DCE, a
closed-form expression of the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of the
channel estimation is derived for both the LR and the UR. Furthermore, the
developed analytical results on NMSE are utilized to perform optimal power
allocation between the training signal and artificial noise (AN). The
advantages of our proposed DCE scheme are two folds: 1) compared to the
existing DCE scheme based on the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)
channel estimator, the proposed scheme adopts a semiblind approach and achieves
better DCE performance; 2) the proposed scheme is robust against active
eavesdropping with the pilot contamination attack, whereas the existing scheme
fails under such an attack.

near-optimally accurate reconstructions with respect to both the frame

except possibly from a subset of Gaussian measure exponentially small in $m$
and for any number $L \geq 2$ of quantization levels per measurement to be used
to encode the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^k$, there is an algorithmic quantization
scheme and a dual frame together which guarantee a reconstruction error of at
most $\sqrt{k}L^{-(1-\eta)m/k}$, where $\eta$ can be arbitrarily small for
sufficiently large problems. Additional features of the proposed algorithm

of piecewise linearity of the total energy as a function of the number of
electrons to each fractional orbital occupation. When applied to approximate
density-functional theory, these corrections give rise to
orbital-density-dependent functionals and potentials. We show that the simplest
implementations of Koopmans' compliance provide accurate estimates for the
quasiparticle excitations and leave the total energy functional almost or
exactly intact, i.e., they describe correctly electron removals or additions,
but do not necessarily alter the electronic charge density distribution within
the system. Additional functionals can then be constructed that modify the
potential energy surface, including e.g. Perdew-Zunger corrections. These
functionals become exactly one-electron self-interaction free and, as all
Koopmans-compliant functionals, are approximately many-electron
self-interaction free. We discuss in detail these different formulations, and
provide extensive benchmarks for the 55 molecules in the reference G2-1 set,
using Koopmans-compliant functionals constructed from local-density or
generalized-gradient approximations. In all cases we find excellent performance
in the electronic properties, comparable or improved with respect to that of
many-body perturbation theories, such as G$_0$W$_0$ and self-consistent GW, at
a fraction of the cost and in a variational framework that also delivers energy
derivatives. Structural properties and atomization energies preserve or
slightly improve the accuracy of the underlying density-functional

  Scale Outcomes",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Discrete ordinal responses such as Likert scales are regularly proposed in
questionnaires and used as dependent variable in modeling. The response
distribution for such scales is always discrete, with bounded support and often
skewed. In addition, one particular level of the scale is frequently inflated
as it cumulates respondents who invariably choose that particular level
(typically the middle or one extreme of the scale) without hesitation with
those who chose that alternative but might have selected a neighboring one. The
inflated discrete beta regression (IDBR) model addresses those four critical
characteristics that have never been taken into account simultaneously by
existing models. The mean and the dispersion of rates are jointly regressed on
covariates using an underlying beta distribution. The probability that choosers
of the inflated level invariably make that choice is also regressed on
covariates. Simulation studies used to evaluate the statistical properties of
the IDBR model suggest that it produces more precise predictions than competing
models. The ability to jointly model the location and dispersion of (the
distribution of) an ordinal response, as well as to characterize the profile of
subject selecting an ""inflated"" alternative are the most relevant features of
the IDBR model. It is illustrated with the analysis of the political
positioning on a ""left-right"" scale of the Belgian respondents in the 2012

monopoles on R^3, where M is the Atiyah-Hitchin space. More recently, the case
of monopoles periodic in one direction (monopole chains) was studied a few

monopole scattering and bound orbits, concentrating on novel features that
arise as a consequence of the periodicity.

dynamics on the phase shifts of matter waves inside a molecule interferometer.
While de Broglie physics generally describes only the center-of-mass motion of
a quantum object, our experiment demonstrates that the translational quantum
phase is sensitive to dynamic conformational state changes inside the
diffracted molecules. The structural flexibility of tailor-made hot organic
particles is sufficient to admit a mixture of strongly fluctuating dipole
moments. These modify the electric susceptibility and through this the quantum
interference pattern in the presence of an external electric field. Detailed
molecular dynamics simulations combined with density functional theory allow us
to quantify the time-dependent structural reconfigurations and to predict the
ensemble-averaged square of the dipole moment which is found to be in good
agreement with the interferometric result. The experiment thus opens a new
perspective on matter wave interferometry as it demonstrates for the first time
that it is possible to collect structural information about molecules even if
they are delocalized over more than hundred times their own diameter.

DPPG$^{\scriptsize{(-)}}$ enhances phase separation, while
DOPG$^{\scriptsize{(-)}}$ suppresses it. Furthermore, the addition of
DPPG$^{\scriptsize{(-)}}$ to a binary mixture of DPPC/cholesterol induces phase
separation between DPPG$^{\scriptsize{(-)}}$-rich and cholesterol-rich phases.
This indicates that cholesterol localization depends strongly on the electric

a significant fraction of the X-ray absorption in AGN is due to BLR clouds.
Here we present the first attempt to perform this kind of analysis in a
homogeneous way, on a statistically representative sample of AGN, consisting of
the ~40 brightest sources with long XMM-Newton and/or Suzaku observations. We
describe our method, based on a simple analysis of hardness-ratio light curves,

find that X-ray eclipses, most probably due to clouds at the distance of the
BLR, are common in sources where the expected occultation time is compatible
with the observation time, while they are not found in sources with longer
estimated occultation times. Overall, our results show that occultations by BLR
clouds may be responsible for most of the observed X-ray spectral variability
at energies higher than 2 keV, on time scales longer than a few ks.

Eri, which appears to have a surprisingly long period of 1071 d and a
significant eccentricity of 0.25. Previous spectroscopic analyses of the WD,
based on a distance of 101 pc inferred from its Hipparcos parallax, yielded a
mass of only 0.43 M$_\odot$, implying it to be a helium-core WD. The orbital
properties of IP Eri are similar to those of the newly discovered long-period
subdwarf B star (sdB) binaries, which involve stars with He-burning cores
surrounded by extremely thin H envelopes, and are therefore close relatives to
He WDs. We performed a spectroscopic analysis of high-resolution spectra from
the HERMES/Mercator spectrograph and concluded that the atmospheric parameters
of the K0 component are $T_{\rm eff} = 4960$ K, $\log{g} = 3.3$, [Fe/H] = 0.09
and $\xi = 1.5$ km/s. The detailed abundance analysis focuses on C, N, O
abundances, carbon isotopic ratio, light (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti) and s-process
(Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd) elements. We conclude that IP Eri abundances agree
with those of normal field stars of the same metallicity. The long period and
non-null eccentricity indicate that this system cannot be the end product of a
common-envelope phase; it calls instead for another less catastrophic
binary-evolution channel presented in detail in a companion paper (Siess et al.

linked to that of the shower electrons and positrons. As charged particles in
extensive air showers are deflected by the magnetic field of the Earth, a
deformation of the angular distribution of the Cherenkov light, that would be
approximately symmetric about the shower axis if no magnetic field were
present, is expected. In this work we study the variation of the Cherenkov
light distribution as a function of the azimuth angle in the plane
perpendicular to shower axis. It is found that the asymmetry induced by the
geomagnetic field is most significant for early stages of shower evolution and
for showers arriving almost perpendicular to the vector of the local
geomagnetic field. Furthermore, it is shown that ignoring the azimuthal
asymmetry of Cherenkov light might lead to a significant under- or
overestimation of the Cherenkov light signal especially at sites where the
local geomagnetic field is strong. Based on CORSIKA simulations, the azimuthal
distribution of Cherenkov light is parametrized in dependence on the magnetic
field component perpendicular to the shower axis and the local air density.
This parametrization provides an efficient approximation for estimating the
asymmetry of the Cherenkov light distribution for shower simulation and
reconstruction in cosmic ray and gamma-ray experiments in which the Cherenkov
signal of showers with energies above 10^14 eV is observed.

all proper faces of $X/T$ are acyclic. In the paper we study the homological
spectral sequence $E^*_{*,*}\Rightarrow H_*(X)$ corresponding to the filtration
of $X$ by orbit types. When the free part of the action is not twisted, we
describe the whole spectral sequence in terms of homology and combinatorial
structure of $X/T$. In this case we describe the kernel and the cokernel of the
natural map $k[X/T]/(l.s.o.p.) \to H_*(X)$, where $k[X/T]$ is a face ring of
$X/T$ and $(l.s.o.p.)$ is the ideal generated by a linear system of parameters
(this ideal appears as the image of $H^{>0}(BT)$ in equivariant cohomology.
There exists a natural double grading on $H_*(X)$, which satisfies bigraded
Poincare duality. This general theory is applied to compute homology groups of
origami toric manifolds with acyclic proper faces of the orbit space. A number
of natural generalizations is considered. These include Buchsbaum simplicial
complexes and posets. h'- and h''-numbers of simplicial posets appear as the
ranks of certain terms in the spectral sequence $E^*_{*,*}$. In particular,
using topological argument we show that Buchsbaum posets have nonnegative
h''-vectors. The proofs of this paper rely on the theory of cellular sheaves.
We associate to a torus space certain sheaves and cosheaves on the underlying
simplicial poset, and observe an interesting duality between these objects.
This duality seems to be a version of Poincare-Verdier duality between cellular
sheaves and cosheaves.

structure: a narrow energy distribution and a low effective mass. Quantum
confinement in nanostructures or the introduction of resonant states were
suggested as possible solutions to this paradox but with limited success. Here,
we propose an original approach to fulfill both requirements in bulk

to engineer the band-structure and produce a type of low-dimensional transport
similar to that targeted in nanostructures, while retaining isotropic
properties. Using first-principles calculations, the theoretical concept is
demonstrated in Fe$_2$YZ Heusler compounds, yielding power factors 4-5 times

cut along geographic and demographic lines. Richer people are more likely to
vote for Republican candidates while poorer voters lean Democratic; this is
consistent with the positions of the two parties on economic issues. At the
same time, richer states on the coasts are bastions of the Democrats, while
most of the generally lower-income areas in the middle of the country strongly
support Republicans. During a research project lasting several years, we
reconciled these patterns by fitting a series of multilevel models to perform
inference on geographic and demographic subsets of the population. We were
using national survey data with relatively small samples in some states, ethnic
groups and income categories; this motivated the use of Bayesian inference to
partially pool between fitted models and local data. Previous, non-Bayesian
analyses of income and voting had failed to connect individual and state-level
patterns. Now that our analysis has been done, we believe it could be
replicated using non-Bayesian methods, but Bayesian inference helped us crack
the problem by directly handling the uncertainty that is inherent in working
with sparse data.

billions of other comparably-bright sources in the night sky. In searching for

then $n_{\rm ISM} \lesssim 1.3 {\rm cm^3}$ (3-$\sigma$), which is the most

limits favor a double-degenerate (DD) scenario--involving two WD stars--for the

annihilation processes are absent. However, in the presence of new interactions

important way. A prominent example is provided by models with spontaneous
lepton number violation, where the existence of new dynamical degrees of
freedom can play a crucial role. In this context, we provide a
model-independent discussion of the effects of right-handed neutrino
annihilations. We show that in the weak washout regime, as long as the
scattering processes remain slow compared with the Hubble expansion rate
throughout the relevant temperature range, the efficiency can be largely
enhanced, reaching in some cases maximal values. Moreover, the $B-L$ asymmetry
yield turns out to be independent upon initial conditions, in contrast to the
""standard"" case. On the other hand, when the annihilation processes are fast,
the right-handed neutrino distribution tends to a thermal one down to low
temperatures, implying a drastic suppression of the efficiency which in some
cases can render the $B-L$ generation mechanism inoperative.

is based on radial velocity data for 135 galaxies obtained at the Telescopio

cluster galaxy members and analyse the internal dynamics of the whole cluster.
We also examine X-ray data retrieved from Chandra and XMM archives. We measure
the cluster redshift, <z>=0.325, the line-of-sight (LOS) velocity dispersion,
\sigma_v~1500 km/s, and the X-ray temperature, kT~9 keV. From both X-ray and
optical data independently, we estimate a large cluster mass, in the 1--4
$10^{15}$ M$_\odot$ range. We attribute the extremely high value of \sigma_v to
the bimodality in the velocity distribution. We find evidence of a significant
velocity gradient and optical 3D substructure. The X-ray analysis also shows
many features in favour of a complex cluster structure, probably supporting an
ongoing merger of substructures in Abell 1351. The observational scenario
agrees with the presence of two main subclusters in the northern region, each
with its brightest galaxy (BCG1 and BCG2), detected as the two most important
X-ray substructures with a rest-frame LOS velocity difference of \Delta v~2500
km/s (in the rest frame) and probably being in large part aligned with the LOS.
We conclude that Abell 1351 is a massive merging cluster. The details of the
cluster structure allow us to interpret the quite asymmetric radio halo as a
`normal' halo plus a southern relic, strongly supporting a previous suggestion
based only on inspection of radio and preliminary X-ray data.

monotonically increases during transition from the low-hard state to the
high-soft state and then saturates for high mass accretion rates. The index
saturation levels vary for different transition episodes. Correlations of Gamma
versus nu_L also shows saturation at Gamma ~ 3. Gamma-Mdot and Gamma-nu_L
correlations with their index saturation revealed in 4U~1630--47 are similar to

  of Signals Based on Random Matrix Theory","16 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimating the number of signals embedded in noise is a fundamental problem
in signal processing. As a classic estimator based on random matrix theory
(RMT), the RMT estimator estimates the number of signals via sequentially
testing the likelihood of an eigenvalue as arising from a signal or noise for a
given over-detection probability. However, it tends to under-estimate the
number of signals as weak signal eigenvalues may be immersed in the
non-negligible bias term among eigenvalues for finite sample size. In order to
solve this problem, we propose an RMT estimator with adaptive decision
criterion (termed as RMT-ADC estimator) by adaptively incorporating the bias
term into the decision criterion of the RMT estimator. Firstly, we analyze the
effect of this bias term among eigenvalues on the estimation performance of the
RMT estimator. Then, we derive both the decreased over-estimation probability
and the increased under-estimation probability of the RMT estimator incurred by
the bias term when assuming the eigenvalue being tested is arising from a
signal, and also derive the increased under-estimation probability of the RMT
estimator incurred by the bias term when assuming the eigenvalue being tested
is arising from noise. Based on these results, the RMT-ADC estimator can
adaptively determine whether the noise variance should be estimated under the
assumption that the eigenvalue being tested is arising from a signal or from
noise, and thus can adaptively select its decision criterion. Moreover, the
RMT-ADC estimator can adaptively determine whether the bias term among
eigenvalues should be incorporated into the selected decision criterion or not.
Therefore, the RMT-ADC estimator can avoid the higher under-estimation
probability of the RMT estimator. Finally, simulation results are presented to
show that the proposed RMT-ADC estimator significantly outperforms the existing
estimators.

quasirelativistic, seem to be instrumental for a conceptual broadening of
current quantum paradigms. However physically relevant properties of related
quantum systems have not yet received due (and scientifically undisputable)
coverage in the literature. In the present paper we address
Schr\""{o}dinger-type eigenvalue problems for $H=T+V$, where a kinetic term
$T=T_m$ is a quasirelativistic energy operator $T_m = \sqrt{-\hbar ^2c^2 \Delta
+ m^2c^4} - mc^2$ of mass $m\in (0,\infty)$ particle. A potential $V$ we assume
to refer to the harmonic confinement or finite well of an arbitrary depth. We
analyze spectral solutions of the pertinent nonlocal quantum systems with a
focus on their $m$-dependence. Extremal mass $m$ regimes for eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of $H$ are investigated: (i) $m\ll 1$ spectral affinity
(""closeness"") with the Cauchy-eigenvalue problem ($T_m \sim T_0=\hbar c |\nabla
|$) and (ii) $m \gg 1$ spectral affinity with the nonrelativistic eigenvalue
problem ($T_m \sim -\hbar ^2 \Delta /2m $). To this end we generalize to
nonlocal operators an efficient computer-assisted method to solve
Schr\""{o}dinger eigenvalue problems, widely used in quantum physics and quantum
chemistry. A resultant spectrum-generating algorithm allows to carry out all
computations directly in the configuration space of the nonlocal quantum
system. This allows for a proper assessment of the spatial nonlocality impact
on simulation outcomes. Although the nonlocality of $H$ might seem to stay in
conflict with various numerics-enforced cutoffs, this potentially serious
obstacle is kept under control and effectively tamed.

a helical liquid is constrained between two superconducting reservoirs
transport at the edge is governed by multiple Andreev reflections. The
resulting quasiparticle distribution functions of the edge channels exhibit
multiple discontinuities at subgap energies with the periodicity of an applied
voltage. The combined effect of interactions, disorder, and normal scattering
off the superconducting interface leads to the inelastic processes mixing
different helicity modes, thus causing smearing of these singularities. If
equilibration is strong, then the distribution functions of the edge channels
tend to collapse into a Fermi-like function with an effective temperature
determined by the superconducting gap, applied voltage, and intraedge
interaction parameter. We conclude that mapping out nonequilibrium distribution
functions may help to quantify the relative importance of various relevant

inward due to angular momentum exchange with gaseous protoplanetary disks. This
process can produce systems of planets in co-orbital (Trojan or 1:1) resonance,
in which two planets share the same orbit, usually separated by 60 degrees.
Co-orbital systems are detectable among the planetary systems found by the
Kepler mission either directly or by transit timing variations. However, no
co-orbital systems have been found within the thousands of Kepler planets and
candidates. Here we study the orbital evolution of co-orbital planets embedded
in a protoplanetary disk using a grid-based hydrodynamics code. We show that
pairs of similar-mass planets in co-orbital resonance are disrupted during
large-scale orbital migration. Destabilization occurs when one or both planets
is near the critical mass needed to open a gap in the gaseous disk. A confined
gap is opened that spans the 60 degree azimuthal separation between planets.
This alters the torques imparted by the disk on each planet -- pushing the
leading planet outward and the trailing planet inward -- and disrupts the
resonance. The mechanism applies to systems in which the two planets' masses
differ by a factor of two or less. In a simple flared disk model the critical
mass for gap opening varies from a few Earth masses at the inner edge of the
disk to 1 Saturn-mass at 5 AU. A pair of co-orbital planets with masses in this
range that migrates will enter a region where the planets are at the
gap-opening limit. At that point the resonance is disrupted. We therefore
predict an absence of planets on co-orbital configurations with masses in the
super-Earth to Saturn mass range with similar masses.

Furthermore, we obtain examples of full groups having a dense free subgroup
whose rank is equal to the topological rank of the full group, using a Baire
category argument. We then study the automatic continuity property for full
groups of aperiodic equivalence relations, and find a connected metric for
which they have the automatic continuity property. This allows us to give an
algebraic characterization of aperiodicity for pmp equivalence relations,
namely the non-existence of homomorphisms from their full groups into totally
disconnected separable groups. A simple proof of the extreme amenability of
full groups of hyperfinite pmp equivalence relations is also given,
generalizing to the non ergodic case a result of Giordano and Pestov.

fractional Laplacian and local or nonlocal reaction terms. The first part of
the paper is devoted to the long time/long range rescaling of the fractional
Fisher-KPP equation. This rescaling is based on the exponential speed of
propagation of the population. In particular we show that the only role of the
fractional Laplacian in determining this speed is at the initial layer where it
determines the thickness of the tails of the solutions. Next, we show that such
rescaling is also possible for models with non-local reaction terms, as
selection-mutation models. However, to obtain a more relevant qualitative
behavior for this second case, we introduce, in the second part of the paper, a
second rescaling where we assume that the diffusion steps are small. In this
way, using a WKB ansatz, we obtain a Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the limit
which describes the asymptotic dynamics of the solutions, similarly to the case
of selection-mutation models with a classical Laplace term or an integral
kernel with thin tails. However, the rescaling introduced here is very
different from the latter cases. We extend these results to the
multidimensional case.

quantum theory, namely the Bohm theory (BT), according to which particles do
have definite trajectories at all times. However, LR interpret the research by
Brown {\em et al.} as implying that ""raw stuff"" or {\em haecceities} are needed
for the individuality of particles of BT, and LR dismiss this as idle
metaphysics. In this paper we note that Brown {\em et al.}'s research does not
imply that {\em haecceities} are needed. Thus BT remains as a genuine option
for those who seek to understand quantum particles as individuals. However, we
go on to discuss some problems with BT which led Bohm and Hiley to modify it.
This modified version underlines that, due to features such as
context-dependence and non-locality, Bohmian particles have a very limited
autonomy in situations where quantum effects are non-negligible. So while BT
restores the possibility of quantum individuals, it also underlines the primacy
of the whole over the autonomy of the parts. The later sections of the paper
also examine the Bohm theory in the general mathematical context of symplectic
geometry. This provides yet another way of understanding the subtle, holistic
and dynamic nature of Bohmian individuals. We finally briefly consider Bohm's
other main line of research, the ""implicate order"", which is in some ways
similar to LR's structural realism.

environment and on the behavioral response to previous stimuli. Such behavioral
feedback is particularly important in navigation. Successful navigation relies
on proper coupling between sensors, which gather information during motion, and
actuators, which control behavior. Because reorientation conditions future
inputs, behavioral feedback can place sensors and actuators in an operational
regime different from the resting state. How then can organisms maintain proper
information transfer through the pathway while navigating diverse environments?
In bacterial chemotaxis, robust performance is often attributed to the zero
integral feedback control of the sensor, which guarantees that activity returns
to resting state when the input remains constant. While this property provides
sensitivity over a wide range of signal intensities, it remains unclear how
other parameters affect chemotactic performance, especially when considering
that the swimming behavior of the cell determines the input signal. Using
analytical models and simulations that incorporate recent experimental
evidences about behavioral feedback and flagellar motor adaptation we identify
an operational regime of the pathway that maximizes drift velocity for various
environments and sensor adaptation rates. This optimal regime is outside the
dynamic range of the motor response, but maximizes the contrast between run
duration up and down gradients. In steep gradients, the feedback from
chemotactic drift can push the system through a bifurcation. This creates a
non-chemotactic state that traps cells unless the motor is allowed to adapt.
Although motor adaptation helps, we find that as the strength of the feedback
increases individual phenotypes cannot maintain the optimal operational regime
in all environments, suggesting that diversity could be beneficial.

$\alpha\simeq \alpha' < 10^{-5}$, the vortex reconnections excite Kelvin waves

These excitations cascade down to the resolution scale $\Delta\xi$ which in our

waves are numerically damped by a line-smoothing procedure, that is supposed to
mimic the dissipation of Kelvin waves by phonon and roton emission at the scale
of the vortex core. We show that the Kelvin waves cascade is statistically
important: the shortest available Kelvin waves at the end of the cascade
determine the mean vortex line curvature $S$, giving $S \gtrsim 30 /\ell$ and
play major role in the tangle decay at ultra-low temperatures below $0.6\,$K.
The found dependence of $\ell S$ on the resolution scale $\Delta \xi$ agrees
with the L'vov-Nazarenko energy spectrum of weakly-interacting Kelvin waves,
$E\Sb{LN}\propto k^{-5/3}$ rather than the spectrum $E\Sb{LN}\propto k^{-1}$,
suggested by Vinen for turbulence of Kelvin waves with large amplitudes. We
also show that already at $T=0.8\,$K, when $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ are still
very low, $\alpha\simeq \alpha'<10^{-3}$, the Kelvin wave cascade is fully
damped, vortex lines are very smooth, $S \simeq 2 /\ell$ and the tangle decay
is predominantly caused by the mutual friction.

(GMD) as a potential environmental risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS). The
aim of this study was to test probable correlation between solar activities and
GMD with long-term variations of MS incidence.
  Methods: After a systematic review, we studied the association between
alterations in solar wind velocity (Vsw) and planetary A index (Ap, a GMD
index) with MS incidence in Tehran and western Greece, during the 23rd solar
cycle (1996-2008), by an ecological-correlational study.
  Results: We found moderate to strong correlations among MS incidence of
Tehran with Vsw (Rs=0.665, p=0.013), with one year delay, and also with Ap
(Rs=0.864, p=0.001) with 2 year delay. There were very strong correlations
among MS incidence data of Greece with Vsw (R=0.906, p<0.001) and with Ap
(R=0.844, p=0.001), both with one year lag.
  Conclusion: It is the first time that a hypothesis has introduced an
environmental factor that may describe MS incidence alterations; however, it
should be reminded that correlation does not mean necessarily the existence of
a causal relationship. Important message of these findings for researchers is
to provide MS incidence reports with higher resolution for consecutive years,
based on the time of disease onset and relapses, not just the time of
diagnosis. Then, it would be possible to further investigate the validity of
GMD hypothesis or any other probable environmental risk factors.

Belavkin","Asymmetry of Risk and Value of Information","16 pages, 2 figures",,"10.1007/978-3-319-10046-3_1",,"math.OC cs.GT cs.IT math.IT math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The von Neumann and Morgenstern theory postulates that rational choice under
uncertainty is equivalent to maximization of expected utility (EU). This view
is mathematically appealing and natural because of the affine structure of the
space of probability measures. Behavioural economists and psychologists, on the
other hand, have demonstrated that humans consistently violate the EU postulate
by switching from risk-averse to risk-taking behaviour. This paradox has led to
the development of descriptive theories of decisions, such as the celebrated
prospect theory, which uses an $S$-shaped value function with concave and
convex branches explaining the observed asymmetry. Although successful in
modelling human behaviour, these theories appear to contradict the natural set
of axioms behind the EU postulate. Here we show that the observed asymmetry in
behaviour can be explained if, apart from utilities of the outcomes, rational
agents also value information communicated by random events. We review the main
ideas of the classical value of information theory and its generalizations.
Then we prove that the value of information is an $S$-shaped function, and that
its asymmetry does not depend on how the concept of information is defined, but
follows only from linearity of the expected utility. Thus, unlike many
descriptive and `non-expected' utility theories that abandon the linearity
(i.e. the `independence' axiom), we formulate a rigorous argument that the von
Neumann and Morgenstern rational agents should be both risk-averse and
risk-taking if they are not indifferent to information.

equation exact solutions for the electron energy and wave function in this
external environment are obtained. On this basis we predict the existence of an
electromagnetic radiation that can be emitted by electrons in dense neutrino
fluxes. We term this phenomenon ""the spin light of electron in dense neutrino

argue that the $SLe_{\nu}$ in dense neutrino fluxes should have important
consequences in astrophysics and for supernovae processes in particular.
